Does the state of the UK economy inspire confidence? An expert crunches the numbers,https://theconversation.com/does-the-state-of-the-uk-economy-inspire-confidence-an-expert-crunches-the-numbers-230925,3027899,"Work, Income, Statistics, UK economy, Give me perspective, UK inflation","
The most recent UK inflation figures, released towards the end of May 2024, saw a drop in the official rate of price rises to 2.3%, not that far off the Bank of England’s target level of 2%. Jeremy Hunt, the chancellor of the exchequer, said the figures were encouraging.
Later that day, the prime minister was apparently so encouraged that he announced the date of the next general election. Rishi Sunak claimed that the British economy was “growing faster than anyone predicted” and that his plan was working.
So just how encouraged should UK residents be about the state of the economy? 
According to the figures, it depends on their level of income. 
When it comes to inflation, for example, there is good news for the poorest households, with falls in the price of energy (down 27%) and transport (down 0.1%) compared to a year ago. There are also smaller rises in the price of food and drink (down from 4% to 2.9%), residential rental costs (3.1% to 2% ) and communication, including mobile phones (7.6% to 4.1%). 





On earnings, the combination of the April 2024 rise in the “national living wage” and the recent fall in the rate of national insurance means that a person working 35 hours a week at minimum wage is now taking home 9.4% more than they were in April last year. 
Most price rises are lower than this increase – some significantly – meaning that people on the lowest incomes are better off in real terms than a year ago.
For higher income households the picture is less positive. People who own their homes face larger price rises (6.6%) for mortgage payments, home insurance and maintenance costs. 
There were also bigger increases in the cost of eating out or staying in a hotel (6.1% v 5.9% in March), as well as in the price of health services, including private healthcare, nursing home fees, prescription costs and everyday medicines (6.8% v 6.7% ). Inflation in recreational and cultural activities remains high at 4.6%. 
Persistently high inflation for services, which did not fall as much as the Bank of England expected, also reduced the likelihood of a fall in interest rates in June 2024. This means that reductions in mortgage rates will come much more slowly, given how closely those two rates are linked in the UK.
In the short term, this pattern of greater optimism for poorer households and less optimism for richer households is likely to remain. Increased labour costs brought about by the higher living wage will lead to further rises in the cost of services, which form a much larger part of consumption by richer households. 
Longer term, there is perhaps more cause for optimism for richer households, with the IMF predicting up to three interest rate cuts this year. 
But the UK economy is yet to deal with the effects of the attacks on cargo ships in the Red Sea, with some shipping costs up 150% since December 2023. This will feed through into inflation over the coming months.
Work pressure
Current job vacancies in the UK are concentrated in retail, hospitality and health and social care work, all of which are heavily reliant on workers on lower incomes. Research suggests that the large number of vacancies should translate into increasing wages.

The opposite is true for higher income households with large falls in the last year in vacancies in the financial (-14.1%), communication (-25.2%) and science (-19.6%) sectors. Given the decreasing vacancies, wages in these sectors are likely to fall. 
Longer term, for both lower and higher income households, sustained wage growth can only be achieved by improving labour productivity. But UK productivity growth remains persistently low across the board. 
Investment in the UK also remains sluggish, and was 0.6% lower at the start of 2024 than it was at the start of 2023. 
Addressing this productivity and investment stagnation will be key to driving longer term increases in wages and living standards for everyone. 
Optimism for some
A cause for more optimism for higher income households (and pessimism for those on lower incomes) could be the longer term impact of AI. The boom in information and communications technology (the so-called “ICT revolution”) resulted in dramatic rises in productivity in certain sectors, contributing to a fifth of UK GDP growth from 1989 to 1998. 
The AI revolution, which the UK is embracing, is predicted to have similar effects, but the benefits of these are expected to be concentrated in higher wage jobs, at the expense of lower wage sectors, where jobs are more likely to be replaced by AI and automation – especially in retail and recreation. 
Overall, short term optimism – and some encouragement – for lower income households is warranted, with rising wages and falling inflation, and the potential for more wage rises on the horizon. But this may be reversed, as the benefits of automation and AI accrue increasingly to those who are already better off.

"No, strict environmental rules do not harm global high-tech firms competitiveness",https://theconversation.com/no-strict-environmental-rules-do-not-harm-global-high-tech-firms-competitiveness-223369,3027604,"Biotechnology, European Union (EU), Europe, Big Pharma, Competitiveness, Regulations, EU regulations, Pharma industry, The Conversation Europe","
Offhand, you may not think of the pharmaceutical and biotech industry as the greenest one around. The sector makes heavy use of chemicals and solvents, not to mention large amounts of water, and its complex supply chains sprawl worldwide. 
The result is a hefty carbon footprint, according to our research. The healthcare industry’s net emissions (nearly a third of which come from the pharmaceutical industry) are estimated to account for 4.4% of global emissions, and if left unchecked, the figure will triple by 2025. 
No wonder businesses are under pressure to go green. Innovative technologies such as biotechnologies, which substitute biological processes for artificial chemical reactions, are often seen as the solution to sustainability problems. 
Indeed, 80% of the most cutting-edge pharmaceutical companies have committed to net-zero goals by 2050 and many others have developed radical plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Novartis aims to achieve carbon neutrality within its operations by 2025 and reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across its whole value chain by 2040. Danish giant Novo Nordisk has also committed to the cause, pledging to achieve net-zero emissions across its entire value chain by no later than 2045. 
But will they walk the talk?





Regulatory pressure
The answer to that question is increasingly being decided by government.
For a start, as per new European rules applicable to all firms, pharma and biotech firms are required to practice what we call materiality reporting, which entails disclosing their environmental and societal effects and acknowledging the financial risks associated with sustainability concerns. In addition, Big Pharma is in the crosshairs of the EU, which has developed a unique strategic plan for the pharmaceutical industry to reduce its environmental impact. This includes a proposed EU-wide ban on over 10,000 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) favoured by the sector, also known as ‘forever chemicals’. 
Other major markets such as Japan and China are continuously updating their environmental protection laws, although environmental policies vary greatly among other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. For example, since 2022, Japan requires domestic companies to annually disclose a broad spectrum of environmental information. Meanwhile, China has also introduced new Environmental Social and Governmental (ESG) disclosure rules for major companies to align with global standards, particularly European requirements. 
Although environmental policies in these countries are not specifically tailored for the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, they significantly impact these sectors, underscoring the far-reaching effects of broader environmental regulations. The United States, however, tend to lag behind other developed countries in enforcing environmental standards, partly as a result of the Trump administration loosening regulations.
So, are such constraints likely to be detrimental to firms’ global strategies? Managerial and corporate rhetoric tends to claim that strict environmental standards have a negative impact on the global competitiveness of EU multinationals.
Environmental sustainability as a competitive edge
Instead, at odds with this commonly-held view, we found that compliance with strict environmental rules does not harm the competitiveness of high-tech multinationals. In fact, our observations suggest the opposite: higher levels of globalization are often associated with a heightened focus on environmental sustainability.
We reached this conclusion by collecting extensive data on 195 leading companies in the pharma and biotech industry listed in the European Scoreboard Database, which ranks the top 2,500 Research & Development spenders. This elite group’s dedication to intensive R&D investments not only shows their commitment to spurring innovation in healthcare but also hints at a broader trend towards sustainability. Leveraging cutting-edge technologies from their R&D endeavours, these companies are strategically positioned to address complex environmental challenges within their industries.
Our study compared companies’ global reach and geographic sales across regions spanning the Americas; Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA) and the Asia Pacific (APAC) on the one hand; and their environmental performance, on the other. The latter focused in particular on their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) scores related to environmental criteria.
What we observed was that pharma and biotech multinationals with a global strategy – ie. generating at least 20% of revenues from each region, but less than 50% from one region – specifically exhibit the highest levels of environmental performance. This association between corporate globalization and environmental performance was found regardless of the environmental stringency of the region or country of origin.
Our explanation is simple: Environmental laws and regulations serve as key incentives for multinational companies to support green innovation, ultimately paving the way for their global expansion. In other words, strict environmental standards are not incompatible with global ambition – rather the contrary.
When looking at each region separately though, we observed some nuances. In the Americas, the top 5 companies (including Merck US and Johnson & Johnson) tended to follow a “home strategy” focused on their home region, despite their high environmental performance, likely because of the ample size of the US market, large enough for companies not to venture farther. In the other regions, globalization is one of the most adopted strategies (for instance by British giant AstraZeneca in EMEA and Japanese Takeda Pharmaceutical in APAC). 
It once again affirms the role of sustainability for companies to maintain their competitiveness in the global market. Still, the home region strategy – whereby companies draw at least 50% of their revenues from their region – is observed to be another favourite one for the top sustainable companies. Although the more rigorous rules impose costs on operations, innovation is believed to make the business run more efficiently, offsetting this cost.
The conclusion will no doubt comfort activists and policy-makers, while reassuring the corporate world: Environmental laws and regulations are crucial motivators for multinational corporations to encourage green innovation and, in doing so, maintain their worldwide competitiveness.
On the academic side of things, our observations open new avenues for future research. For instance, the large adoption of the host region strategy by companies in some key countries such as Japan, China, Denmark and Ireland, where green standards are high, opens the question of how the regulations in the host region, compared with those in the home region, might affect the adoption of their globalization development strategy.

Power cuts have hit South Africaâs labour market hard: the biggest toll has been on jobs ,https://theconversation.com/power-cuts-have-hit-south-africas-labour-market-hard-the-biggest-toll-has-been-on-jobs-new-research-230793,3027541,"Electricity, Work, Unemployment, Energy, Employment, Industry, Wages, Manufacturing, Labour market, Work hours, Job losses, Peace and Security, Load Shedding, Power cuts, green transition, power supply","
Access to electricity – measured by the share of individuals who use electricity as their main energy source – has significantly improved in lower-income countries in recent decades. Thanks to large-scale rural electrification and infrastructure development programmes, 90% of the population in these countries had access by 2021, up from about 74% at the turn of the century. 
In many of these countries, however, electricity supply is often unreliable. Generating capacity is inadequate, there’s not enough investment in infrastructure, and energy prices are high. Consequently, outages are frequent and long-lasting. By forcing households and firms to use alternatives, such as diesel generators and back-up batteries, these outages raise the costs  of energy, thus limiting the benefits of access. Those costs come in the form of direct expenses for households and firms and broader social impacts.
Power outages have long been identified as a major constraint to economic development. Many studies document their negative effects on economic growth, firm productivity and sales. It is unsurprising then that people are willing to pay a relatively large amount for reliable power.
Because of those negative effects, it’s likely that outages have an impact on the labour market too. This is of particular interest in high-unemployment contexts, like South Africa, where creating decent jobs is key to alleviating poverty. However, evidence on these effects is scarce. 





We analysed the labour market effects of scheduled electricity outages in South Africa – referred to as load shedding – in a recently released paper.
We found that power outages have had negative effects on employment, as well as working hours and monthly earnings among those who remained employed. Effects on employment have been larger than effects on working hours or earnings. This highlights the threat that load shedding poses to job preservation and job creation efforts. 
These effects were not, however, the same for all firms. Workers in the energy-intensive manufacturing industry appear particularly vulnerable to losing their jobs. Also, small and large firms responded differently. Small firms tended to favour reducing working hours rather than introducing layoffs. 
Lastly, effects varied by load shedding intensity. Low levels of load shedding don’t affect the labour market strongly, but high levels did.
Measuring the impact
South Africa boasts almost universal access to electricity, but has been subjected to power cuts for over 15 years since the end of 2007. 
Load shedding is primarily a consequence of frequent breakdowns at the national utility, Eskom. This is due to a combination of poor long-term planning, a lack of financial resources, rampant state capture and corruption, and aging coal-fired power stations – 80% of which have passed their mid-life point.
These outages have become more frequent and severe in recent years. In 2023 – the worst year on record – load shedding was in place for a total of 289 complete days. 
Several studies have found that power outages reduce economic growth. But to our knowledge there has been no empirical evidence of their labour market effects until now.
We modelled these labour market effects using over 15 years’ worth of nationally representative labour force survey data, covering nearly 3 million individuals. We merged this with macroeconomic data and high-frequency electricity data from 2008 to 2023. 
We considered impacts in three distinct ways. 
First, in a binary sense which compared labour market outcomes during periods of load shedding to outcomes when there was no load shedding. 
Second, in a continuous sense to account for differences in load shedding intensity over time, as measured in MW of unmet demand. 
Third, because load shedding in reality is implemented in “stages”, we analysed differences in effects between different load shedding stages. For instance, stage 1 refers to up to 1,000MW of unmet demand and stage 6 up to 6,000MW. 
We focused on effects on employment, working hours, hourly wages and monthly earnings. We also considered how effects varied across firms of different sizes and in different industries. 
We adjusted all our models to ensure that the measured impacts were not driven by other factors. These included labour market dynamics during the COVID-19 pandemic period, seasonality, or changes in macroeconomic conditions relating to gross domestic product, the interest rate, exchange rates and investment.
The effects – large and small
We found that load shedding was significantly and negatively associated with employment, working hours and monthly earnings.
On average, periods of load shedding were associated with a 2.6% lower chance of being employed, 1.3% fewer working hours per week (equal to about half an hour), and 1.7% lower real monthly earnings. These are large effects. We did not, however, find evidence of a relationship with hourly wages. This suggests that the monthly earning reductions were driven by fewer working hours.
Low levels of load shedding did not have these associations. But they were markedly worse with higher levels.
We didn’t find any evidence of negative associations for stages 1 and 2 load shedding, but from stage 3 upwards, the impact became evident and grew stronger. For instance, stage 3 was associated with 1.9% lower employment, compared to 3.6% for stages 4 and 5 and almost 6% for stage 6.
Not all firms were affected equally. Manufacturing – a relatively energy-intensive industry – was worst off by far. We found that load shedding was associated with nearly 17% lower manufacturing employment, about 6.5 times larger than the average of all industries.
In most industries, our model suggested that working hours were cut when power was cut.
Workers in large firms were vulnerable to all outcomes. In contrast, those in small firms were only vulnerable to reductions in working hours, but not to job losses or wage cuts. One might expect larger firms to be less vulnerable, as they would have more resources to pay for alternative energy sources. While that’s probably true, large firms are more likely to operate in energy-intensive sectors.
Our analysis suggests that small firms have tended to reduce working hours rather than laying off staff, an outcome which is not unique to South Africa.
What needs to be done
These results highlight the negative effects of load shedding on the real economy. From a policymaking perspective, the primary goal of course must be to reduce the frequency and intensity of the outages, and ultimately eliminate them. 
Recent events are encouraging. Efforts by the national utility have resulted in fewer breakdowns and improved generation capacity. In addition, deregulation and tax incentives appear to have increased demand from households and firms for alternative energy sources like solar. 
Supply is expected to remain constrained in the medium term, however. 
Longer-term policy decisions revolve around moving faster towards renewable energy sources, encouraging private investment and, overall, building a more resilient and sustainable energy system.

Ghanaâs anti-LGBTIQ+ bill is being challenged in the supreme court. Why the decision to broadcast it live matters,https://theconversation.com/ghanas-anti-lgbtiq-bill-is-being-challenged-in-the-supreme-court-why-the-decision-to-broadcast-it-live-matters-230562,3027540,"Media, Justice, Queer, Gay rights, Lawyers, Ghana, Judges, TV cameras, Peace and Security, Public communications, T&F research, Broadcast TV","
Ghana’s Supreme Court is live televising its proceedings on the country’s controversial anti-LGBTQI+ bill. This was on the request of Ghana’s attorney general, who cited public interest and transparency. 
The bill was passed by the country’s parliament in February 2024 amid global furore and local outcry. The bill criminalises not only  LGBTQI+ relationships, but also those who support queer rights. 
After it was passed, two citizens filed a case before the country’s highest court, in an effort to restrain the president of Ghana from making the bill law. They have asked the court to rule that the bill contravenes aspects of Ghana’s constitution and should be declared null and void. Thus, the defendant is the speaker of Ghana’s parliament. 
This is the second time the court has allowed cameras in. The first was during its hearing of a disputed presidential election in 2012. The court decided a live broadcast was required to dispel notions of bias.   





Most countries allow live cameras in some lower courts. But most apex court proceedings are still conducted away from the public gaze. The United States Supreme Court, for example, has never allowed live television broadcast during its proceedings.
I believe that televising the proceedings presents both benefits and drawbacks. As a communication studies scholar, I’ve examined the effects of language around marginalised people. Debating whether other people deserve to be treated with dignity and respect could either improve things for them or continue to harm them.
The live broadcast will help promote transparency, education and accountability within the judicial system over a culturally tense issue. But it also puts the queer community in the national spotlight. It could make the climate even more hostile to queer Ghanaians. 
Deepening participation
One of the primary advantages of broadcasting the Supreme Court proceedings is transparency. Citizens can see the judicial process in action for themselves, and hear the arguments directly. 
This gives them a chance to learn how legal decisions are made. Democracy thrives when the public understands how specific laws that can take away their rights are made. And it is essential to explore how Ghana’s constitution protects citizens from government overreach, police brutality and abuse. 
Because of what i’ve found in my research, I believe the voices of marginalised people should be heard when polices and laws are made. They have insights into the implications of such laws. 
To safeguard Ghana’s democracy, people need to listen to principled moral arguments about why some parts of a person’s rights should be curtailed. 
The broadcast will also give the public an opportunity to hear, in detail, the arguments against the bill. These were barely heard during the bill’s consideration and passage in parliament. The parliamentary debates were dominated by moral and religious arguments, not legal ones.  
The case will be of educational value. It will help the general public understand constitutional law and human rights arguments. And it will be helpful for students, especially those who study law, media, journalism, politics and governance. 
Lastly, broadcasting the proceedings will put a face to those who oppose the bill. Most of the time, opponents of LGBTQI+ criminalisation  have remained invisible  for fear of being ostracised or, worse, assault. 
Seeing a lawyer and a researcher making rational arguments against the bill might “humanise” those who oppose criminalising queer people.
The case against broadcasting from court
The decision to televise the proceedings has been met with with apprehension in some quarters.
For example, the Ghana Journalists Association has expressed concerns that the live broadcasts will be abused. Its concern is that some journalists may prioritise the entertainment value over accuracy and fairness. 
Some Ghanaian media houses already do this by selecting and overplaying particular scenes in courtrooms, distorting the reality. This is an unethical practice.
In following news reporting about LGBTIQ+ issues in Ghana, I have found that Ghanaian journalists are unfamiliar with the language relating to issues of gender, sexuality and queer rights. My research also shows that the media houses reproduce imbalanced reporting that tends to put the views of conservative religious leaders over those of human rights advocates. 
On top of this, translating the proceedings from English into local languages could lead to a misinterpretation of the vital legal issues. Various linguistic scholars have noted the challenges with translating human rights doctrines and charters into African languages. 
Some journalists have shown bias in their reporting against the queer community in Ghana; some have even formed an association. 
Lastly, the highly charged nature of the case could create an even more hostile environment for queer Ghanaians. The broadcast could be used as a rallying point to intensify anti-LGBTQI+ sentiments – and even lead to violence.
What needs to be done
Policymakers, legal professionals and media houses must carefully consider the ethical, legal and social ramifications of televising cases involving queer issues in Ghana. Journalists in particular need to be trained on how to report such culturally dense cases. The police should open a special phone line service for responding to cases involving anti-LGBTQI+ violence, harassment and assault. 
Finally, the Ghana Journalists Association should provide a rating system that can hold journalists and media houses accountable for providing accurate and balanced reporting.

Tanzaniaâs dams: flood risk depends on how theyâre planned and operated,https://theconversation.com/tanzanias-dams-flood-risk-depends-on-how-theyre-planned-and-operated-230269,3027539,"Climate change, Energy, John Pombe Magufuli, Julius Nyerere, Crisis, Climate crisis, Hydroelectric dam","
The Rufiji River, which drains into Tanzania’s south-east coast, experienced a major wave of flooding in April 2024. The flooding caused tragic loss of life and affected at least 88,000 individuals. More than 28,000 hectares of crops were damaged.
There has been much debate in Tanzania on the causes of this disaster, particularly the presumed role of the new Julius Nyerere Dam, which is built on the river. Barnaby Dye has studied the development and funding of dams, including those in Tanzania. He provides some insights into the potential risks and solutions.
What are the large dams in Tanzania and what were they built for?
Tanzania has a long history of dam building, from its early independence days in 1961. The country’s founding leader, Julius Nyerere, inaugurated the small Nyumba Ya Mungu hydroelectric plant in 1968. A steady programme of large dams followed. These included the dual Kidatu and Mtera dams completed between 1975 and 1988. The New Pangani Falls dam and Kihansi were completed in the mid to late 1990s.
The primary goal for all these dams was hydropower, which has historically dominated Tanzania’s electricity mix.  





The 20th century also saw the dominance of an ideology trumpeting the power of these dams – and their electricity – to transform Tanzania’s economy into an industrialised society. The long-planned Stiegler’s Gorge Dam, in particular, which was recently renamed the Julius Nyerere Hydropower Project, captured these development dreams. They were part of Nyerere’s socialist vision for creating a so-called modern developed country.
However, a reliance on hydropower in the 21st century has plunged the country into repeated power cuts during droughts. Hydropower is also being questioned, given long build times, and environmental and social costs. There was a fall in dam building as the government prioritised quicker-win, and sometimes deeply corrupt, gas and oil plants. 
This changed with the arrival of President John Magufuli (2015-2021), who decided that the Julius Nyerere 2.1 gigawatt megadam was the answer to Tanzania’s development and electricity needs. He refocused stagnant planning efforts and construction started in 2018. 
Six years later, the dam is nearing completion, with the main dam wall and reservoir in place and first turbines operational.
Do any of these dams pose particular risks in the event of flooding?
Dams can prevent floods, storing water in large reservoirs and slowly releasing it downstream. But they can also make flooding worse, or trigger a disaster. 
Dam collapses caused by poor maintenance, incorrect operation, or inadequate planning and construction quality are among the worst human-made disasters. The 2019 collapse of a Brazilian dam, for example, killed at least 250 people. China’s 1975 dam disaster  killed 240,000 people after heavy rainfall overwhelmed a series of dam walls.
None of Tanzania’s dams have been built primarily for flood control. Most 20th Century dams operate more like run-of-river projects, meaning that they are built to constantly produce electricity and not to store significant volumes of water from the rainy season for drier spells. Therefore, with the exception of Mtera Dam, Tanzania has not historically had the storage reservoirs to prevent significant flooding. 
The Julius Nyerere Dam could be different given its large reservoir. However, some media reports blamed the Julius Nyerere Dam for the 2024 floods,, as the new hydropower project sits directly upstream of the area that flooded in April. Other reports argued that it prevented a worse flood. It’s difficult to judge as little has been released about the current design and operation of the nearly-complete dam. 
Earlier versions of the design envisaged a large storage dam. So it’s plausible that the dam is benign, as the government has claimed. Official spokespeople insisted that it prevented flooding in 2023 when the reservoir was being filled. 
Without the necessary information, though, it’s impossible to reject arguments that the dam caused the destructive flooding. Tanzania has endured  painful and constant power cuts. Thus, it is plausible that the government sought to maximise electricity generation from the new dam. Such a strategy would involve keeping the reservoir at its highest level over time. This could leave authorities ill prepared to store water from abnormally heavy rains like those experienced across east Africa in 2024. 
As the reservoir approached dangerously high levels, dam operators would need to suddenly release as much water as possible to prevent it from overflowing and breaking the dam wall. Such actions, while preventing a worse dam collapse, would have caused severe flooding. Indeed, officials from the state-owned electricity utility reportedly stated that a release from the Julius Nyerere Dam caused April’s floods.
Thus, Tanzania’s dams, like others around the world, constitute a flood risk whose likelihood depends on how the dams are planned and operated.
What are some solutions to the flood risk?
Climate change models predict increased rainfall variability, and therefore more floods, in Tanzania’s future. Given the inherent risk of emergency dam releases in the short term, the government needs an effective early warning system to alert those downstream when water releases occur. Such a system seems to have failed this year.
Longer-term solutions should focus on slowing water and addressing the ultimate cause of flooding: having too much water in too short a time. 
The government’s proposal involves construction of more dams. In my view, this approach to flood control seems shortsighted. These dams could worsen, rather than solve, extreme floods. And planned dams are designed only for hydropower – they  leave little storage for flood prevention.
New dams on the Rufiji River come with major trade-offs as they pose a risk for other economic mainstays:

support for tourism and globally significant ecosystems. 

Natural infrastructure that slows water movement, like wetland or groundwater capture, holds the best potential. It is a cheaper, more effective solution, with economic opportunities for livelihood diversification. Equally, adaptation may hold the key, as researchers Stéphanie Duvail, Olivier Hamerlynck and colleagues found in thier participatory study. Changing housing and agriculture to cope with periodic flooding would allow Tanzania to enjoy the economic benefits that natural river floods bring.

Idea of EU citizenship still intangible for most Europeans,https://theconversation.com/idea-of-eu-citizenship-still-intangible-for-most-europeans-230994,3027538,"European Union (EU), European identity, The Conversation Europe, European elections 2024","
From Thursday 6 until Sunday 9 June, Europeans from 27 member states will be hitting the polls in a vote with heavy stakes for the climate transition, immigration and democracy. But to what extent do these voters define themselves as Europeans? Will their ballot be driven by continental issues dear to Brussels, national considerations, or the populism that’s become increasingly evident across the continent?
National lenses
According to the April Eurobarometer survey, 60% of Europeans claim to be interested in this election – that’s an increase of 11% compared with 2019. Member states’ political parties are also well aware of the importance of the elections, having shown up on campaign trails throughout the bloc in the past weeks. However, the campaign is still heavily influenced by national issues. For example, in France, from where I write, questions of purchasing power and national security dominate the airwaves, despite the fact that these subjects correspond to areas that fall mainly within the authority of member states and in the EU can play only a limited and indirect role.
Voters should make no mistake about what is at stake: these elections are an opportunity for them to exercise their European citizenship by taking up European issues. However, it has to be said that Europeans have made very little of their EU citizenship.
This is borne out by a 2023 Eurobarometer survey carried out in the 27 EU Member States, as well as 39 non-EU countries. 58% of those questioned said they felt a sense of attachment to the EU – 3 percentage points lower than in the previous survey. This represents a low level of identification compared to that with the nation state, with 91% of Europeans saying they felt attached to their country.





As for the European Union, 72% of interviewees feel they are EU citizens. Asked what elements could create a sense of European community, 23% cited values and the economy, 22% culture, 21% solidarity and 20% the rule of law. Finally, 58% said they were aware of their rights tied to EU citizenship, while 70% said they would like to know more.
European citizenship has existed for 30 years, but do Europeans know about it?
Has EU citizenship missed its target? Once upon a time, it was a promising concept. Introduced by the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, it responded to Member States’ desire to move beyond the notion of trade alliance by developing a sense of belonging to a political project.
Formally, EU citizenship is undeniably effective, bestowing a set of civil and political rights, including that to vote and stand for election at the European Parliament. But although it has celebrated its 30th anniversary, it remains evasive for most.

No doubt its features make it ambiguous and abstract. In fact, even if the treaty frames it as an added value – especially when it comes without any explicit duties – its dependence on the nationality of a Member State gives it a superfluous character. Democratic practices also reinforce this minor status, since elections to the European Parliament are organised within the borders of member states, with national rather than transnational lists, and electoral campaigns are structured nationally.
Furthermore, EU rights are hardly perceptible. The right to vote and stand for election to the parliament existed before the introduction of European citizenship. Above all, many of these rights are mainly enjoyed by Europeans who are temporarily or permanently resident in another member state. EU citizenship allows Europeans living in a member state other than their own to vote and stand as a candidate in municipal elections. When an EU citizen is in a country outside the bloc where their nation doesn’t have a diplomatic presence, they have the right to the protection of another member state – a real legal added value.
What’s more, most of EU rights aren’t reserved to the bloc’s citizens alone, but also extend to third-country nationals and companies – for example, the right to petition the European Parliament and to refer matters to the European ombudsman. The same applies to the right to good administration and the right of access to EU institutional documents. Finally, the main features of European citizenship, derived from the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality, hail from a rich but complex and little-known body of case law.
Bringing Europe closer to its citizens
European citizenship has been shaped by the theory of constitutional patriotism – the reasons for joining may stem not from geographical proximity or kinship, but from attachment to a shared political culture based on a common history and values.
EU citizenship is everything but artificial, drawing its roots from a rich religious, intellectual and cultural heritage harking back to the 11th century. Since then, exchanges between Europeans – most notably in the area of trade – have forged a European culture based on the principles of freedom, equality and human dignity. This is why the Court of Justice has described European citizenship as a fundamental status of nationals of the member states (ECJ, 20 September 2001, Grzelczyk judgment). Not only does it establish a legal and political relationship between them and the Union, but it also makes it possible to offer Europeans the same legal and political status.
To compensate for European citizenship’s perceived legal weaknesses, it’s necessary to raise awareness on this shared history, culture and values. Indeed, while the creation of a European citizenship was a bold step, its associated rights are not enough to build a political community. Law alone cannot bring Europe closer to the heart of Europeans, especially when the EU’s institutional organisation is hard to grasp. And by placing too much emphasis on the union’s economic contributions, its promoters are making European citizenship and its democratic substance less perceptible.
It’s essential to encourage initiatives aimed at promoting a genuine European public sphere. For example, at my home institution, the Université Bretagne Sud in France, we have simulated debates at the European Parliament, while the European Movement association enabled secondary-school students to visit EU institutions in Brussels. The results speak for themselves: participants all felt a palpable sense of “unity in diversity” and European citizenship.

"Avocados are a âgreen goldâ export for Mexico, but growing them is harming forests and waters",https://theconversation.com/avocados-are-a-green-gold-export-for-mexico-but-growing-them-is-harming-forests-and-waters-226458,3027310,"Agriculture, Crime, Trade, Exports, Deforestation, Mexico, Superfoods, Organized crime, Monoculture, Water shortage, North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Produce","
Consumers’ love for avocados in the United States seems to know no bounds. From 2001 through 2020, consumption of this fruit laden with healthy fats tripled nationwide, rising to over 8 pounds per person yearly. 
On average, 90% of those avocados are grown in the southwest Mexican state of Michoacán. As with other foods that have become trendy, such as acai berries, or widely used, such as palm oil, intensive avocado production is causing significant environmental damage.
My research on 20th-century Latin American environmental history examines how the transnational movement of people, foods and agricultural technologies has changed rural landscapes in Latin America. Currently, I’m writing a book on the development of a global avocado industry centered in Michoacán, the world’s largest avocado-growing region.

My research shows that raising avocados is economically beneficial in the short term for farmers, which in Latin America typically means medium-sized operators and agribusinesses. It also helps growers – people in rural areas who grow subsistence crops. Over time, though, every serving of avocado toast takes a toll on Michoacán’s land, forests and water supply. Rural growers, who lack the resources of large-scale farmers, feel those impacts most keenly. 
The environmental effects of monoculture
Michoacán is the only place on earth that grows avocados year-round, thanks to its temperate climate, abundant rainfall and deep, porous volcanic soils that are rich in potassium, a vital plant nutrient. Even under favorable conditions, however, monocultures are never environmentally sustainable.
Introducing homogeneous, high-yielding plant varieties leads growers to abandon native crops. This makes the local ecosystem more vulnerable to threats such as pest infestations and reduces food options. It also erodes fertile soils and increases use of agrochemicals.
Monoculture also can drive deforestation. Mexican officials estimate that avocado production spurred the clearance of 2,900 to 24,700 acres of forests per year from 2010 through 2020. And it’s resource intensive: Avocado trees consume four to five times more water than Michoacán’s native pines, jeopardizing water resources for human consumption. 

Bred in California
Avocados have been a part of the Mexican diet since ancient Mesoamerica, but the Hass – the most popular variety worldwide today – was bred in modern California. 
In the late 19th century, scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture embarked on a mission to collect and send home samples of food plants from around the world. The goal was to adapt and grow these plants in the United States, reducing the need for food imports. 
Collecting plant genetic material from Latin America and imposing quarantines on avocados from Mexico starting in 1914 provided vital support for the development of a U.S. avocado industry. Farmers in California and Florida bred multiple strains from the material that USDA explorers collected. But U.S. consumers in the early 1900s weren’t familiar with this new food and hesitated to buy avocados of various textures, sizes and colors. 
In response, farmers began selecting plants that grew avocados with small seeds, abundant flesh, hard skin, a creamy texture – and, most importantly,  high yields. According to industry lore, Rudolph Hass, a postman and amateur horticulturalist in Southern California, stumbled on a new variety in the late 1920s while trying to propagate a variety called Rideout. 
Within several decades, the Hass became the dominant avocado grown in California. By the 1950s, Mexican farmers who had connections with U.S. brokers had introduced the Hass south of the border.

How the Hass changed Michoacán
In the early 1960s, Michoacano cantaloupe farmers acquired lands to expand their production by growing avocados. Soon they focused on exclusively producing the Hass. 
Many local Indigenous Purhépecha people, along with non-Indigenous campesinos, or country farmers, rented or sold land to the emerging avocado farmer class. In the 1980s, campesinos began to grow the fruit too. This was an expensive, long-term undertaking: It took four years for the trees to produce marketable avocados, but growers had to buy the trees, clear land for them and provide water, fertilizer and pesticides to help them grow.  
Cantaloupe farmers could afford to invest capital for four years with no cash return. Campesinos had to rely on loans or remittances from family members abroad to develop avocado orchards. 
As production expanded, agrochemical distributors, tree nurseries and packing houses sprouted on Purhépecha lands, clearing native pine trees and eroding the fertile soils. Mexico passed a law in 2003 that prohibited clearing forests for commercial agriculture, but by this time campesinos in Michoacán were already growing Hass avocados on a large scale.

The guacamole wars: NAFTA and avocados
After the adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, California avocado farmers lobbied to maintain a quarantine that the USDA had imposed on Mexican avocado trees in 1914 because of an alleged plague. After three years of drought in California and testing of Michoacán orchards for pests, Mexico began shipping Hass avocados to the U.S. in 1997. 
However, the only region the USDA certified to send avocados to the United States was Michoacán. Mexico had to allow the USDA to station agents in Michoacán to verify that certified orchards fulfilled agreed conditions to minimize the risks of plant diseases.
Companies such as Calavo, a California-based produce distributor, began to buy, pack and ship avocados grown in Michoacán to U.S. customers. In the process, they became major competitors for California avocado farmers. 
Beyond monoculture
Today, avocados are one of the most-regulated exports from Mexico. However, these rules do little to address the industry’s environmental impacts. 
Farmers in Michoacán continue to clear woodlands, spray agrochemicals, exhaust aquifers and buy Purhépecha communal property, converting it to smaller, privately owned lots. Rising profits have spurred violence and corruption as some local authorities collude with organized crime groups to expand the market. 

Visiting Michoacán on Feb. 26, 2024, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ken Salazar pledged that the U.S. would modify its protocol to block imports of avocados grown in illegal orchards. However, this won’t restore local ecosystems. 
As I see it, expecting small-scale growers to protect the environment, after the ecology and economy of Michoacán has been radically altered in the name of free markets and development, puts responsibility in the wrong place. And boycotting Mexican avocados likely would simply lead growers to look for other markets. 
Diversifying agriculture in the region and reforesting Michoacán could help to restore the Sierra Purhepecha’s ecology and protect the rural economy. One Indigenous community there is successfully growing peaches and lemons for the domestic market and avocados for the international market, while also planting native pines on their communal lands. This is a potential model for other farmers, although it would be hard to replicate without state support.  
In my view, importing avocados from different areas of Mexico and the world to reduce the Hass market share may be the most effective environmental protection strategy. In 2022, the USDA approved imports of avocados grown in the Mexican state of Jalisco. This is a start, but Jalisco will follow Michoacán’s trajectory unless the U.S. finds more sources and promotes more avocado types. 
As U.S. eaters’ tastes become more adventurous, sampling avocados of different sizes, shapes, textures, tastes and origins could become a decision that’s both epicurean and environmentally conscious.

State laws threaten to erode academic freedom in U.S. higher education,https://theconversation.com/state-laws-threaten-to-erode-academic-freedom-in-u-s-higher-education-230186,3027309,"Education, Academic freedom, US higher education, Florida, Education law, Higher ed attainment, Higher ed, Diversity, equity and inclusion, Book bans, DEI, gag order","
Over the past few years, Republican state lawmakers have introduced more than 150 bills in 35 states that seek to curb academic freedom on campus. Twenty-one of these bills have been signed into law.
This legislation is detailed in a new white paper published by the Center for the Defense of Academic Freedom, a project established by the American Association of University Professors, or AAUP. Taken together, this legislative onslaught has undermined academic freedom and institutional autonomy in five distinct and overlapping ways.
1. Academic gag orders
As detailed in the report, state legislators introduced 99 academic gag orders during legislative sessions in 2021, 2022 and 2023. All of the 10 gag orders signed into law were done so by Republican governors. These bills assert that teaching about structural racism, gender identity or unvarnished accounts of American history harm students.
These gag orders are widely known as “divisive concept” or “anti-CRT” bills. CRT is an acronym for critical race theory, an academic framework that holds racism as deeply embedded in America’s legal and political systems. The partisan activists, such as Christopher Rufo, have used this term to generate a “moral panic” as part of a political response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. 





For example, in April 2022, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed House Bill 7, the “Stop Woke Act.” The law defines a “divisive concept” as any of eight vague claims. They include claims that “Such virtues as merit, excellence, hard work, fairness, neutrality, objectivity, and racial colorblindness are racist or sexist.” 
U.S. District Judge Mark Walker described this law as “positively dystopian.” He noted that the government’s own lawyers admitted that the law would likely make any classroom discussion concerning the merits of affirmative action illegal. The vague wording of these gag orders has a chilling effect, leaving many faculty unsure about what they can and cannot legally discuss in the classroom.
2. Bans on DEI programs
The expansion of diversity, equity and inclusion – or DEI – services on campus was a major outcome of the racial justice protests in 2020. By 2023, however, the legislative backlash was in full swing. Forty bills restricting DEI efforts were introduced during the 2023 legislative cycle, with seven signed into law.
For example, Texas’ Senate Bill 17 drew directly from model policy language developed by Rufo and published by the Manhattan Institute, a right-wing think tank. SB 17 banned diversity statements and considerations in hiring. It also restricted campus diversity training and defunded campus DEI offices at Texas’ public universities. 
As detailed in the AAUP white paper, only a handful of people testified in favor of SB 17, and almost all had stated or unstated affiliations with right-wing think tanks. In contrast, more than a hundred educators and citizens testified, or registered to testify, against the bill. Since its passage, Texas public universities have seen the closing of DEI programs and reduced campus services for students from minority populations. For example, after the Legislature accused the University of Texas-Austin of violating SB 17, the school was forced to shut down its DEI office. This involved laying off 40 employees.  

3. Weakening tenure
Tenure was developed to shield faculty members from external political pressure. The protections of tenure make it possible for faculty to teach, research and speak publicly without fear of losing their jobs because their speech angers those in power. As detailed in the report, however, during the 2021, 2022 and 2023 legislative sessions, 20 bills were introduced, with two bills weakening tenure protections signed into law in Florida and another in Texas.
In Florida, for example, SB 7044 created a system of post-tenure review, empowering administrators to review tenured faculty every five years. The law further empowers administrators to dismiss those whose performance is deemed unsatisfactory. The law also requires that faculty post course content in a public and searchable database.  
The AAUP criticized the law, noting that SB 7044 has “substantially weakened tenure in the Florida State University System and, if fully implemented as written,” would effectively “eliminate tenure protections.” Now even tenured faculty have reason to fear that what they teach might be construed as a “divisive concept,” as CRT, or as promoting DEI.  
4. Mandating content
Lawmakers in several states have also passed legislation mandating viewpoint diversity, establishing new academic programs and centers to teach conservative content and shifting curricular decision-making away from the faculty. 
For example, Florida’s Senate Bill 266 expanded the Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education at the University of Florida, without faculty input or oversight. The original proposal for the Hamilton Center stated that the center’s goal was to advance “a conservative agenda” within the curriculum.
SB 266 also gave the governing boards overseeing the university and college systems the authority to decide which classes count toward the core curriculum. This power was exercised in November 2023 after Manny Diaz, the education commissioner in Florida, requested that the boards remove an introduction to sociology course. He stated on social media that the discipline had been “hijacked by left-wing activists and no longer serves its intended purpose as a general knowledge course for students.”  
5. Weakening accreditation
The accreditation process is an obscure area of academic governance whereby colleges and universities regularly subject themselves to external peer review. Nonprofit accrediting agencies conduct these institutional performance reviews. 
As detailed in the report, during the 2021-23 legislative cycles, six bills were introduced – three of them were passed into law – weakening the accreditation process, thereby making it easier for political interests to shape university policy.
For example, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill’s accreditor, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges, warned the school’s board of trustees that establishing the School of Civic Life and Leadership without faculty oversight and consultation raised serious concerns about institutional independence. The Legislature responded with Senate Bill 680, which would require that North Carolina public universities choose a different accrediting agency each accreditation cycle. Eventually passed as part of the omnibus House Bill 8, this policy allows schools to “shop” for an accrediting agency less likely to object to such political interference in the curriculum. 
These five overlapping and reinforcing attacks on academic freedom and institutional autonomy threaten to radically transform public higher education in ways that serve the partisan interests of those in power.

"Franceâs headscarf ban in the 2024 Summer Olympics reflects a narrow view of national identity, writes a scholar of European studies",https://theconversation.com/frances-headscarf-ban-in-the-2024-summer-olympics-reflects-a-narrow-view-of-national-identity-writes-a-scholar-of-european-studies-228678,3027308,"Religion, Europe, Muslims, France, Hijab, Catholic church, Laïcité, Headscarf, Religion and society, 2024 Paris Olympics","
The 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris have sparked a discussion about whether female Muslim athletes who wear a headscarf should be allowed to compete. 
In September 2023, the International Olympic Committee, upholding freedom of religious and cultural expression for all athletes, announced that athletes participating in the 2024 Paris Games can wear a hijab without any restriction.
French athletes, however, are bound by France’s strict separation of religion from the state, called laïcité. French Sports Minister Amelie Oudea-Castera said that French athletes would be barred from wearing a hijab during the Paris games to respect this commitment to the principle of laïcité.
Human rights organizations argued that such a ban infringes upon the religious freedoms of Muslim athletes, perpetuating discrimination and marginalization. The United Nations human rights office stated that “no one should impose on a woman what she needs to wear, or not wear.” 





This debate highlights the conflict between laïcité and the right to express one’s religious beliefs. As a scholar of European studies, I know about laïcité’s impact on sports, politics and society in general. In my view, laïcité, which historically upheld individual rights and freedoms, increasingly denies minority rights today, as seen in the ban on French athletes wearing hijabs at the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Laïcité yesterday and today
Before the 1789 revolution, France was an absolute monarchy, where religion and the state were deeply intertwined. 
The close relationship between the French monarchy and the Catholic Church began when King Charlemagne was crowned by the pope in 800 A.D. Over the centuries, the church became very powerful, owning land and controlling education and health care. It formed strong political alliances, with many nobles holding top positions within the church. 
After the French Revolution succeeded and the monarchy was abolished, the revolutionaries still resented religion for its long relationship with the crown. They saw the church as a source of unfairness in society and wanted to reduce religion’s influence in public life and push their ideas of freedom, fairness and unity. 
They nationalized church properties and introduced secularism to create a separation between religious and governmental affairs. Since then, France has maintained laïcité as one of the republic’s core values. 
The evolution of laïcité in France coincides with significant demographic shifts in the latter half of the 20th century. As France transformed into a diverse nation with various religions and ethnicities, including a significant Muslim population, the interpretation and application of laïcité faced new challenges. With millions migrating from former French colonies in northern and western Africa in search of economic opportunities, France now hosts the largest Muslim community in Europe, comprising about 10% of its population. This demographic change has sparked debates about the role of religion in public life and the extent to which laïcité should accommodate religious diversity.
While laïcité was originally introduced alongside principles such as freedom and equality, as times changed, so did its meaning. Initially, laïcité meant keeping religion separate from the state. Lately, however, it is often interpreted to mean that citizens should refrain from showing their religious identities in public. 
This shift has led to bans on religious symbols in public schools and spaces, disproportionately affecting Muslim women who wear veils.
A debate about the Olympics – and beyond
Activists and scholars have argued that today’s laïcité poses a threat to both human rights and religious freedom. In their view, it promotes a narrow view of republican values and national identity, rejecting diversity and unfairly targeting Muslim women who wear headscarves.
Laïcité can be seen as discriminatory because it often treats Christian customs as just part of everyday culture, while it treats visible signs of other religions, such as the hijab worn by some Muslim women, as unacceptable. This means Christian symbols and traditions are more easily accepted, but non-Christian ones are often not allowed. 
It is also important to note that Christian traditions focus mostly on beliefs, which are private, while Islamic and Jewish traditions emphasize practices, such as wearing headscarves, that are visible. This means laïcité affects people differently, often more strictly targeting visible signs of non-Christian religion.
A 2023 survey showed that almost 80% of French Muslims believed that their country’s secular laws are discriminatory. Research shows that laïcité disproportionately affects Muslim girls from marginalized communities, perpetuating social inequalities. For example, the ban on headscarves in schools forces Muslim girls to choose between their education and their religious beliefs, leading to feelings of exclusion and isolation. This policy can also hinder their academic performance and personal development, limiting their future opportunities. 
Banning hijab for players
French Muslim athletes have faced challenges on the field for a long time. For example, in 2023, the French Soccer Federation decided not to adjust meal and practice timings during Ramadan, even though it occurred during a break when there was no competition. 

This decision effectively prevented Muslim players from fasting and led to notable departures, such as Lyon midfielder Mahamadou Diawara leaving the France under-19s camp. Other French players, too, left French professional sports. Basketball player Diaba Konate also opted to pursue her career in the United States because of the French ban on wearing the hijab. 
In 2004, France prohibited religious symbols in public schools, including the hijab, Jewish yarmulkes, Sikh turbans and large Christian crosses. 
The nonprofit Human Rights Watch criticized it as an unjustified restriction on religious practice. In 2010, France extended the ban to face-covering headgear in public places, including the burqa and niqab, which are garments worn by some Muslim women that cover the face and body.  Last year, France banned the abaya in schools. 
A ban on cultural pluralism?
The hijab debate extends beyond the realm of sports, touching upon broader issues of identity and belonging in multicultural societies. For many Muslim women, the hijab is not just clothing – it is an expression of religious identity and empowerment. 
Banning it from the Olympics could be seen as limiting their freedom of expression and denying their right to fully engage in society while staying true to their religious and cultural backgrounds. 
France’s ban on religious symbols in official sports activities highlights the struggle to balance religious freedom with national values. This becomes especially complicated in the Olympics, where athletes’ individual expressions clash with their roles as representatives of their countries.

"Colon cancer rates are rising in young Americans, but insurance barriers are making screening harder",https://theconversation.com/colon-cancer-rates-are-rising-in-young-americans-but-insurance-barriers-are-making-screening-harder-228673,3027307,"Cancer, Health insurance, Colorectal cancer, Oncology, Colon cancer, Cancer risk, Cancer screening, Gastroenterology, Health disparities, Colonoscopy, health insurers, Colon cancer screening","
More than 53,000 Americans are projected to die from colorectal cancer this year. Although colorectal cancer is the second-most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States, it can be cured if caught early. Detecting a tumor as soon as possible can help you get treatment as soon as possible, giving you the best chance for survival.
In my work as a gastroenterologist, I treat patients from every background and walk of life. Uniting them are a growing number of insurance barriers threatening access to timely care. All too often, payers take a long time to make coverage determinations, or they even deny them outright.
With the alarming rise of colorectal cancer diagnoses among Americans under 50, it is more important than ever for people to know their cancer risk and when to get screened. 
Here are common questions I and other gastroenterologists get from patients about colorectal cancer:





What is my colorectal cancer risk?
Anybody at any age can develop colorectal cancer. However, some people may be more likely to get the disease than others. 
For example, people with a family history of colorectal cancer or a personal history of polyps, which are abnormal growths in the tissue of the colon or rectum, may have a higher risk. 
Inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis can also increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer. This is because the chronic inflammation associated with these diseases can promote the development of abnormal growths.

Race and ethnicity may also affect colon cancer risk. Black and Indigenous Americans are significantly more likely to develop – and die from – colorectal cancer. While genetics does play a  role in disease development, much of the risk of colorectal cancer is linked to environmental factors. These include a person’s income level, types of food and groceries available in the neighborhood, access to primary care providers and specialists, and a wide variety of other social determinants of health.
Lifestyle factors like smoking, not exercising regularly and poor diet can also increase your colon cancer risk. Researchers have shown that red meat releases chemicals that can cause inflammation, while high-fiber foods and vegetables can help lower inflammation. Similarly, a sedentary lifestyle can also increase inflammation. Smoking can lead to harmful genetic changes in colon cells.
What are my screening options?
People with colorectal cancer usually don’t exhibit symptoms until the disease progresses to a later stage. That is why early and regular screening is critical. 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends Americans begin regular screenings at age 45. Recognizing that the incidence of colorectal cancer has grown among younger adults, the task force lowered the age from 50 in 2021. Screening may start earlier and occur more frequently for people who have an increased risk of colon cancer.
There are various screening methods, and your medical provider can recommend procedures based on your risk factors. 
Many people choose to get a colonoscopy, which is a screening test that can also prevent cancer by removing precancerous polyps. It involves using a long, flexible tube with a light and a camera on the end to visually inspect the colon for signs of cancer, abnormalities in the colon lining, or growths such as polyps. Ultimately, colonoscopy screening can significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer. 

Other screening strategies include noninvasive stool testing, imaging scans and a combination of endoscopic visualization with stool-based testing. 
Your doctor can help you select a test that aligns with your preferences, values and risk factors. Suggested screening approaches in people with an average colon cancer risk include a colonoscopy every 10 years, stool-based testing every one to three years, or CT scans every five years for those who are unable to have a colonoscopy as an initial screening test. A positive test result for these alternative approaches should be followed by a colonoscopy.
With routine screening, one out of every three colorectal cancer deaths can be avoided.
Why won’t my health insurance pay for my colonoscopy?
While colorectal cancer screening is free as a preventive service under the Affordable Care Act, some insurers are making it harder for people to get care.
For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts proposed a 2024 policy that would have deemed the use of anesthesia in endoscopies, colonoscopies and other vital procedure as medically unnecessary. This meant patients would have had to pay out of pocket to cover the anesthesia needed for colorectal cancer screenings, potentially creating major cost barriers. The insurance company only reversed course after an outcry from physicians and patients.
Another troubling trend is expanded use of prior authorization, a process some health insurers use to determine if they will cover the cost of a medical procedure, service or medication. Insurers can delay or deny coverage of medically necessary care that physicians and medical guidelines recommend because they deem certain health care services unnecessary for a patient or too expensive to cover.  

In 2023, UnitedHealthcare proposed a policy that would have required the 27 million people under their plan to obtain insurance approval before they could get diagnostic or follow-up colonoscopies. After protests from physicians and patients, the insurer put the policy on hold. 
UnitedHealthcare has also made plans to introduce a program in 2024 that could involve prior authorization for colonoscopies. The insurer has released little information about why it feels such requirements are necessary, what services would require prior authorization and how it would protect patients from unnecessary delays and denials.
How can I lower my risk of colorectal cancer?
If you haven’t already, look into getting screened for colorectal cancer. Talk with your doctor’s office and check with your insurance company to understand what will be covered before your procedure. If you’re 45 or older, a colonoscopy can screen for and prevent colorectal cancer.
Younger adults can take steps to reduce their risk of colon cancer by adopting healthy eating and lifestyle behaviors. Being aware of personal risk factors and seeking medical attention for symptoms – such as changes in bowel habits, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain or unexplained weight loss – can help you discuss screening options with your health care provider.
If you have already had a colonoscopy and had polyps removed, make sure you know when you are due to return for a follow-up colonoscopy. It could save your life.

UK and US elections: 2 very different systems united by a common political language,https://theconversation.com/uk-and-us-elections-2-very-different-systems-united-by-a-common-political-language-230831,3027306,"Politics, Elections, US Congress, UK parliament, UK elections, US elections, parliamentary system, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, US election 2024","
Voters in the United Kingdom on May 22 learned the date they would be joining the many, many people casting ballots around the world in 2024. 
In a surprise move, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced a snap election to be held on July 4 – six months earlier than many had expected. An early election is certainly a major gamble for the prime minister but one he felt was worth taking. With the ruling Conservative Party more than 20 percentage points behind opposition Labour in the latest polls, Sunak faces an uphill battle to stay in office. 
The Labour Party, led by Keir Starmer, is heavily favored to return to power for the first time since 2010.
To a U.S. audience, many of the top issues in the election campaign will sound familiar: the economy, immigration, health care, Ukraine and Gaza. The choice of date, too, may ring a bell – and political soothsayers are already trying to read into what it means for the U.K. election to fall on Independence Day.






But as to the campaign itself – well, they do things a bit different on the other side of the pond. While Americans may be used to set terms and lengthy campaigns filled with endless advertising, in the U.K. such things are, to use a Britishism, “just not cricket.” Here are three main ways in which the British conduct their elections.
1. Election timeline
U.S. elections follow a predictable schedule. In 1845, Congress passed a law establishing a single day for federal elections to take place on “the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November.” Further, presidents are elected for a fixed four-year term, making the dates for upcoming votes knowable for the foreseeable future.
That isn’t the case in the United Kingdom. By convention, elections have been held on a Thursday since 1935. But the month of the vote has varied considerably. For the most part, they take place in late spring or early summer – but fall and winter elections are not unheard of. 
The U.K. Parliament does have a fixed term of five years, with elections automatically scheduled once that time has lapsed. In practice, however, parliaments have rarely gone the full five years. 
Indeed, prime ministers in the United Kingdom have the authority to request the dissolution of Parliament at any time. They can do so without the approval of the cabinet, and so prime ministers have taken liberal advantage of their ability to control the timing of the election to try and gain an advantage. 
Many thought that Sunak may have been eyeing an election later in the year, but a number of factors, including economic forecasts and not wanting the distraction of a U.S. election, may have factored in to him calling an earlier-than-expected vote.
2. Campaign rules
Besides the shifting timing, the nature and rules of the campaign are also very different in the United Kingdom. This starts with the sheer brevity of the campaign. Once Parliament is dissolved, the election must take place 25 working days later. This means the parties have a mere six weeks to make their case to the public.
And unlike in a presidential system, voters in the United Kingdom do not cast a ballot for the person they want to see lead the country. Instead, the U.K. is divided into 650 distinct constituencies; voters pick their preferred candidate to represent their local constituency in Parliament. The party with the most seats typically wins the election, and the leader of that party has the opportunity to become prime minister and govern as a single-party government or as part of a coalition. 
U.K. election campaigns are also subject to strict rules to maintain neutrality. Once the campaign starts, the period of “purdah” kicks in, which imposes certain restrictions on government activities. This involves, for instance, strict prohibitions on government ministers announcing new initiatives to affect the election or using public funds for political purposes.
In the same manner, civil servants – employees of the crown who work for the government but are not political appointees – are required to maintain strict impartiality and not become involved in partisan debates.
Moreover, the Office of Communications, the United Kingdom’s independent media regulatory authority, also enforces strict rules for broadcast media, including television and radio. The 2003 Communications Act requires that all broadcast media must cover the elections in an impartial manner, providing coverage of all parties, even if they do not assign equal time.

Broadcast media is also not allowed, on polling day, to suggest the outcome of the vote before polls are closed. 
In a huge departure from the U.S., U.K. political parties are banned from buying television ads, but this rule does not apply to streaming television.
3. The role of money
The limited role of money is another distinct feature in U.K. elections. Even factoring in the different population sizes, U.K. elections are significantly cheaper than their counterparts in the United States. 
Indeed, total campaign spending in the 2020 U.S. elections, covering presidential and congressional races, hit more than US$14 billion. That scale completely dwarfs how much parties and candidates will be able to spend in the 2024 United Kingdom election.
Through regulations established by the Electoral Commission, an independent government agency, a British party that competes in all constituencies in the United Kingdom will be allowed to spend just over £34 million (around $43 million) in total to support all candidates. 
That figure in itself marks an 80% increase from the allowance at the last election in 2019, so to factor for inflation since limits were set in 2000.
Individual candidates can spend funds to support their campaign. But the amount, defined partly by the size of the constituency, is low and in the scale of tens of thousands of pounds. This is again a far cry from some of the more expensive congressional races in the United States, where even primary elections could attract close to $30 million in spending.
Challenging times ahead
As a result, both Sunak and Starmer will have only a short time – and limited funds – to make their case to voters. Whoever wins will face a very challenging situation at home and abroad, with little to no respite. According to the think tank Institute for Fiscal Studies, the state of public finances is “a dark cloud that hangs over the election.” And then there is the delicate matter of maintaining a special relationship with the U.S. – a country that may itself have a very different political landscape after it goes to the polls later in the year.

A lesson on dissent from a Vietnam War protester who joined the US military â and then faced execution after his protest didnât stop,https://theconversation.com/a-lesson-on-dissent-from-a-vietnam-war-protester-who-joined-the-us-military-and-then-faced-execution-after-his-protest-didnt-stop-229091,3027305,"Vietnam War, College campus, Anti-woke, Martin Luther King, Jr. (MLK), Race riots, US protests, Civil rights era, Black Studies","
During the late 1960s, when protests against the Vietnam War erupted across the country, college campuses emerged as places of more than intellectual debate over U.S foreign policy and the country’s deeply racist history. 
Unlike the protesters against the Israel-Hamas War, many of the college-age demonstrators back then faced the very real possibility of being drafted by the U.S. military and forced to serve in what they considered an unjust war. I was one of the fortunate young Black men who had a deferment that enabled me to avoid compulsory military service because I was enrolled in college.
While some saw my deferment as a lifesaver, I was troubled by my friends who had either been drafted or already killed. By the end of 1968, the war had resulted in the deaths of nearly 17,000 Americans, with another 87,000 wounded. Among the bloodied were a disproportionate number of Black soldiers.
The protests also made me feel guilty about my own sense of patriotism as I reconsidered the military service of my father, several of his brothers, my grandfather and great-grandfather in different U.S. wars.





All of these competing factors came to a boil one day when I was listening to a professor rant and rave against the Vietnam War. Troubled, confused and increasingly frustrated, I asked the philosophy professor if he had ever fought in a war.
As some may know, a core tenet of existentialism is that one should experience reality in order to critique it.
He answered, “No.”  
“Then how can you criticize it,” I snapped.
After that exchange, it didn’t take long before another disgruntled student and I dropped out of Southern Illinois University and walked into a nearby Army recruiting station. Both of us enlisted. He joined the Green Berets, the Army’s elite special forces, and I went into the Army Security Agency.
Surprisingly, I would learn later that my protest against the war – and appreciation for U.S. democracy – had only begun.
Secrets and truths
The Army Security Agency was a top secret unit within the Army. It was connected to the National Security Agency, a U.S. Department of Defense agency charged with supporting combat operations and providing cryptological security, cybersecurity and national intelligence. After my training, I received my orders for the war in Vietnam.  
Our task was to be the eyes and ears of U.S. soldiers on the ground by providing intelligence on Vietnamese troops. It was 1971, and I was stationed about 50 miles within the demilitarized zone in a place called Phu Bai Combat Base. 

For about the first six months, we did our jobs well. But almost to a man, we began to seriously question the U.S. role in Vietnam and whether the war was moral or just. We no longer believed in the American mission to prevent the spread of communism. 
We came to the conclusion that communist leader Ho Chi Minh, the leader of North Vietnam, was on the side of freedom. He had modeled his dreams of independence from colonial France on George Washington and the American Revolution against British rule. 
So what did we do?  
We went on strike. 
Acts of treason?
Our commanders were pissed, and they read us the riot act. We became part of a small number of Vietnam soldiers that committed mutiny by refusing to do our job. Because the crimes were committed during an active war, we were threatened with major penalties, including court martial and execution by firing squad. 
But our commanders had a dilemma. How do you punish about 100 essential intelligence officers with top-secret security clearances?  
The Army did something unique – they promoted each of us and promptly shipped us to different locations in Vietnam to serve out our service tours. 
Though we were thousands of miles away, our individual and collective protests against the war as soldiers kept us linked – at least symbolically – with our peers on college campuses. 
Black student protests
When I finally returned to Southern Illinois University in 1976, the war had ended, but the racial unrest on college campuses and cities had continued.
Thinking back, its hard to rationalize all the chaos that was occurring. Cities were burning. New York City’s Harlem borough in 1964. The Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts in 1965. The entire year of 1967 became known as the “long hot summer” after more than 150 race riots erupted across the country. One of the most violent riots took place in Detroit, where 43 Black demonstrators were killed, anywhere between 450 and 2,000 were injured, and 7,231 were arrested before the National Guard ended the bloody mess on July 25, 1967. 

And just as soon as the civil disorder appeared to subside, another wave of racial protests occurred in more than 100 cities across the country after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968.
In all, between 1965 and 1968, nearly 329 disturbances took place in 257 cities, resulting in nearly 300 deaths, 8,000 injuries, 60,000 arrests and property losses running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
But from all of the racial chaos came at least one tangible result on college campuses – the emergence of Black studies programs.
In February 1968, Black students at San Francisco State University withstood police beatings and mace and staged a 133-day strike to establish the new academic discipline. The school was the nation’s first to have a Black studies department.   
It didn’t take long before other universities created similar departments. By the early 1970s, more than 500 schools had programs that explored the complexities of the Black experience long ignored by traditional academia. 
Though its original intent was to empower Black students, the new departments were designed for the benefit of everyone and welcomed robust debate over long-accepted narratives that placed white people at the center of history, culture and innovation. 
Those ideals are still relevant as demonstrators for the rights of Palestinians on college campuses draw some of their tactics from the 1960s struggle against racial oppression in the U.S. and French colonial rule in Vietnam.
But that debate over how American history and U.S. imperialism is taught rages on as anti-woke campaigns in 24 states want to restrict the teaching of race in public schools, state agencies and institutions. 
As a professor of critical race studies, I welcome the chance to fight once again. America was born in protest, and civil disobedience is part of our national DNA. There was no reason to stop then, and there’s no reason to stop now.

"Hurricanes donât stop at the coast â these mountain towns know how severe inland flood damage can be, and theyâre preparing",https://theconversation.com/hurricanes-dont-stop-at-the-coast-these-mountain-towns-know-how-severe-inland-flood-damage-can-be-and-theyre-preparing-230089,3027304,"Climate change, History, Mountains, Extreme weather, Rural, Storms, Flooding, Hurricanes, North Carolina, Flood risk","
The French Broad River winds through the mountains of western North Carolina, fed by dozens of mountain streams, and crosses the city of Asheville. At over 2,000 feet above sea level and more than 250 miles from the coast, it is an unlikely place to prepare for a hurricane.
Yet, the remnants of several hurricanes have swept through this region over the years, sending rivers in the region raging out of their banks.
When these storms hit back to back, the devastation can be enormous. In September 2004, for example, remnants of Hurricanes Frances, Ivan and Jeanne all brought excessive rain to western North Carolina in the span of a few weeks, overwhelming the French Broad and other rivers in the Asheville area.
Western North Carolina’s history is just one example of the inland risks from tropical cyclones.

In 1955, Connie, followed closely by Diane, produced some of the worst inland river flooding in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. Diane became known as the first billion-dollar storm. The compound impacts prompted Congress to fund major studies of hurricane meteorology and protection efforts. 
Vermont was caught off guard by Tropical Storm Irene in 2011, which swept away hundreds of homes. In 1998, Tropical Storm Charley traveled nearly 200 miles up the Rio Grande Valley, quickly flooding the dry Texas landscape, with devastating consequences. The remnants of Hurricane Ida in 2022 caused nearly US$84 billion in damage as its heavy rains caused flooding in states from Louisiana to New York.
I am a historical geographer who researches flood hazards and how communities both exacerbate the risk and respond. With the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, expected to be exceptionally busy, storms like these are a reminder to mountain communities and other inland regions across the U.S. to prepare.
Tough lessons from North Carolina’s mountains
Western North Carolina provides an important case study of a hurricane season risk that might seem rare but can be catastrophic. It also shows how some communities are starting to respond.
In July 1916, the Asheville area was deluged by back-to-back tropical storms that tore apart river bridges and roads, washed away businesses and left large parts of the city under water.
The first tropical storm made landfall in Mississippi and meandered into the Southern Appalachians. As it lingered over western North Carolina, 6 to 10 inches of rain fell in the mountains, running off into creeks and then into rivers, including the French Broad.

A week later, a second tropical storm moved ashore, this time in South Carolina and headed for the already saturated ground of the French Broad River basin. It dropped 12 to 15 inches near Brevard. Weather Bureau forecasters wrote that saturated soils allowed 80% to 90% of the new precipitation to run off the mountains into French Broad River tributaries.
At Asheville, the river rose to 23.1 feet – a record more than 5 feet higher than any crest before or since. The water washed out bridges and damaged most businesses and industries on the floodplain. 
Dozens of people died in the flooding, and commerce was disrupted for weeks. The Santee River, which flows seaward from the Blue Ridge Mountains, destroyed some 700,000 acres of crops in South Carolina.

Responses to the 1916 storms weren’t enough
After the storms, there was talk of replacing some devastated structures with flood-proof buildings. However, the importance of rail transport and the limited amount of land for commercial and industrial uses compelled reconstruction near the river. Congress approved a flood control study in 1930, but no structural protections were built. Revised building codes and land use restrictions to reduce flood impacts came much later. 
Then, in September 2004, the region was hit with back-to-back tropical storm disasters again.
Hurricane Frances made landfall on Florida and eventually climbed the Blue Ridge Mountains into Western North Carolina. Remnants of the hurricane dumped 8 to 12 inches of rain near Asheville. Black Mountain received 14.6 inches, which flowed into a French Broad River tributary, triggering widespread flooding where the rivers meet. The torrent severed a water main and cut off drinking water to Asheville residents.

Shortly after Frances hit, Hurricane Ivan roared ashore in Alabama and moved inland, bringing 4 to 12 more inches of rain to the French Broad basin over three days. Saturated soils on the mountain slopes lost their grip and caused numerous landslides, and portions of Asheville and Brevard flooded. Remnants of Hurricane Jeanne brought even more rain to western North Carolina a few days later.
Using the past to plan for the future isn’t enough
Traditionally, officials planning for hazards like hurricanes have relied on records of past events to guide their decisions. However, this approach assumes that the climate is stable, and that just isn’t the case.
As the climate warms, the air can hold more moisture, meaning tropical cyclones – as well as inland thunderstorms – can deliver more rain. 
This can be particularly troublesome as giant storms move inland and cause streams and rivers to flood. Back-to-back storms can be even more destructive. New development in areas that were once unlikely to flood may be more susceptible as the climate heats up.

Some communities are starting to consider how future risk might worsen.
In the Asheville area, Buncombe County’s hazard mitigation plan now explicitly recognizes hurricane risks and acknowledges that “future occurrences are likely.” 
Following the 2004 flood, the county modified its use of a water supply reservoir to include storage of floodwaters, and it now requires new buildings constructed in areas inundated in 2004 to be elevated 2 feet above the base flood elevation. The city of Brevard, 30 miles south of Asheville, restricted construction in flood-prone areas to limit future losses. 
Asheville has created green spaces along the French Broad River and has made efforts to enlarge stormwater retention behind dams on tributaries. But altering stormwater drainage systems is costly when the existing systems were designed to meet historical rainfall levels, rather than the scale of rainfall that will accompany climate change.

Extreme weather events, including mountain and inland flooding, are becoming a frequent problem across the U.S., and I believe they demand greater consideration in disaster planning at all levels. For communities, preparing for these future risks requires learning from past floods but also recognizing that future storms may produce flooding that goes beyond the scale of anything seen before.
This article has been updated to correct the date of Tropical Storm Irene.

"Iâm an astrophysicist mapping the universe with data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory â clear, sharp photos help me study energetic black holes",https://theconversation.com/im-an-astrophysicist-mapping-the-universe-with-data-from-the-chandra-x-ray-observatory-clear-sharp-photos-help-me-study-energetic-black-holes-229668,3027303,"Astronomy, Space, Supernovae, Black hole, X-ray, Galaxies, Supermassive black holes, New research","
When a star is born or dies, or when any other very energetic phenomenon occurs in the universe, it emits X-rays, which are high-energy light particles that aren’t visible to the naked eye. These X-rays are the same kind that doctors use to take pictures of broken bones inside the body. But instead of looking at the shadows produced by the bones stopping X-rays inside of a person, astronomers detect X-rays flying through space to get images of events such as black holes and supernovae.
Images and spectra – charts showing the distribution of light across different wavelengths from an object – are the two main ways astronomers investigate the universe. Images tell them what things look like and where certain phenomena are happening, while spectra tell them how much energy the photons, or light particles, they are collecting have. Spectra can clue them in to how the event they came from formed. When studying complex objects, they need both imaging and spectra.
Scientists and engineers designed the Chandra X-ray Observatory to detect these X-rays. Since 1999, Chandra’s data has given astronomers incredibly detailed images of some of the universe’s most dramatic events. 

Stars forming and dying create supernova explosions that send chemical elements out into space. Chandra watches as gas and stars fall into the deep gravitational pulls of black holes, and it bears witness as gas that’s a thousand times hotter than the Sun escapes galaxies in explosive winds. It can see when the gravity of huge masses of dark matter trap that hot gas in gigantic pockets.






NASA designed Chandra to orbit around the Earth because it would not be able to see any of this activity from Earth’s surface. Earth’s atmosphere absorbs X-rays coming from space, which is great for life on Earth because these X-rays can harm biological organisms. But it also means that even if NASA placed Chandra on the highest mountaintop, it still wouldn’t be able to detect any X-rays. NASA needed to send Chandra into space.
I am an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, part of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard and Smithsonian. I’ve been working on Chandra since before it launched 25 years ago, and it’s been a pleasure to see what the observatory can teach astronomers about the universe.
Supermassive black holes and their host galaxies
Astronomers have found supermassive black holes, which have masses ten to 100 million times that of our Sun, in the centers of all galaxies. These supermassive black holes are mostly sitting there peacefully, and astronomers can detect them by looking at the gravitational pull they exert on nearby stars. 
But sometimes, stars or clouds fall into these black holes, which activates them and makes the region close to the black hole emit lots of X-rays. Once activated, they are called active galactic nuclei, AGN, or quasars. 
My colleagues and I wanted to better understand what happens to the host galaxy once its black hole turns into an AGN. We picked one galaxy, ESO 428-G014, to look at with Chandra.
An AGN can outshine its host galaxy, which means that more light comes from the AGN than all the stars and other objects in the host galaxy. The AGN also deposits a lot of energy within the confines of its host galaxy. This effect, which astronomers call feedback, is an important ingredient for researchers who are building simulations that model how the universe evolves over time. But we still don’t quite know how much of a role the energy from an AGN plays in the formation of stars in its host galaxy. 
Luckily, images from Chandra can provide important insight. I use computational techniques to build and process images from the observatory that can tell me about these AGNs.

The active supermassive black hole in ESO 428-G014 produces X-rays that illuminate a large area, extending as far as 15,000 light years away from the black hole. The basic image that I generated of ESO 428-G014 with Chandra data tells me that the region near the center is the brightest, and that there is a large, elongated region of X-ray emission.
The same data, at a slightly higher resolution, shows two distinct regions with high X-ray emissions. There’s a “head,” which encompasses the center, and a slightly curved “tail,” extending down from this central region. 
I can also process the data with an adaptive smoothing algorithm that brings the image into an even higher resolution and creates a clearer picture of what the galaxy looks like. This shows clouds of gas around the bright center. 
My team has been able to see some of the ways the AGN interacts with the galaxy. The images show nuclear winds sweeping the galaxy, dense clouds and interstellar gas reflecting X-ray light, and jets shooting out radio waves that heat up clouds in the galaxy.
These images are teaching us how this feedback process operates in detail and how to measure how much energy an AGN deposits. These results will help researchers produce more realistic simulations of how the universe evolves.
The next 25 years of X-ray astronomy
The year 2024 marks the 25th year since Chandra started making observations of the sky. My colleagues and I continue to depend on Chandra to answer questions about the origin of the universe that no other telescope can.
By providing astronomers with X-ray data, Chandra’s data supplements information from the Hubble Space Telescope and the James Webb Space Telescope to give astronomers unique answers to open questions in astrophysics, such as where the supermassive black holes found at the centers of all galaxies came from. 
For this particular question, astronomers used Chandra to observe a faraway galaxy first observed by the James Webb Space Telescope. This galaxy emitted the light captured by Webb 13.4 billion years ago, when the universe was young. Chandra’s X-ray data revealed a bright supermassive black hole in this galaxy and suggested that supermassive black holes may form by the collapsing clouds in the early universe.
Sharp imaging has been crucial for these discoveries. But Chandra is expected to last only another 10 years. To keep the search for answers going, astronomers will need to start designing a “super Chandra” X-ray observatory that could succeed Chandra in future decades, though NASA has not yet announced any firm plans to do so.

How Israel uses financial control as a tool of collective punishment against Palestine,https://theconversation.com/how-israel-uses-financial-control-as-a-tool-of-collective-punishment-against-palestine-230886,3027016,"Tax, Israel, Poverty, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, West Bank, Palestinian Authority, Tax revenues, financial abuse, Economic crisis, financial support, Second Intifada, Oslo Peace Accords, Bezalel Smotrich, Give me perspective","
Israel’s finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, announced on May 22 that Israel will withhold Palestinian tax revenues from the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank “until further notice”. The move came on the same day that Norway, Spain and Ireland announced that they will recognise a Palestinian state. 
These funds constitute between 60% and 65% of the Palestinian public budget. Withholding them will have a devastating effect both on a Palestinian government already in financial crisis and on the lives of the Palestinian people.
This is not the first time Israel has withheld funds that provide basic goods and services to people in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has used this tool six times since the peace accords of the 1990s, when it began collecting tax on behalf of the Palestinian Authority.

      Norway, Ireland, Spain recognise Palestinian statehood: what this means for Middle East peace – expert Q&A









The first episode occurred in 1997 on account of violence between settlers and Palestinian people in the West Bank. The EU had to step in to cover the Palestinian Authority’s operational expenditures, and the US eventually pressured Israel to transfer the revenues later that year to maintain peace negotiations. 
Then, in 2000, Palestinians staged a major uprising against Israeli occupation, known as the Al-Aqsa intifada (or the the second intifada). Israel accused the Palestinian government of financing terrorist activities during the uprising. Despite the fact that no evidence was found to support the allegations, Israel withheld tax revenues again, this time for two years – the longest period it has ever done so.
By 2002, the Palestinian Authority’s revenue had dropped by 79%. And public sector employees, who at the time made up 26% of those working inside the West Bank and Gaza, went without their full wages for the entire period.
Violence in the Palestinian territories and Israel intensified until 2005. The West Bank and Gaza suffered immense destruction, with the cost of replacing the damaged infrastructure estimated at US$1.7 billion (£1.3 billion). And Israeli forces turned many cities, towns and villages in the West Bank into restricted military zones, placing residents under curfew for days at a time. This together pushed the Palestinian government to the brink of financial collapse.

The next episode happened in 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections and assumed administrative control of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. From March 2006 to July 2007, Israel withheld tax revenue worth an estimated US$1.1 billion. This froze most government activities, including essential public services in health and education, and caused a dramatic economic downturn. 
Under the leadership of EU, international donors intervened to provide direct financial support to Palestinians. This included providing social allowances for some unpaid government employees and financial assistance for low-income families. But, at the request of Israel, this financial support bypassed the Palestinian Authority and was channelled through alternative mechanisms.
In 2011, Israel suspended tax revenues for one month after the Palestinian Authority applied for recognition of the Palestinian state in the UN General Assembly. And then, in early 2015, Israel withheld tax revenues for a sixth time after the Palestinian Authority applied to join the International Criminal Court.
Between 2000 and 2017, the Palestinian Authority sustained US$6.6 billion in losses as a result of the delayed revenue transfers. This was largely due to the loss of interest earned and the borrowing costs of alternative financing. Yet Israel has never compensated the Palestinian Authority for these costs.
In addition to withholding revenues, Israel unilaterally deducts bills for electricity, water, health, sewage and court orders before sending a net revenue amount to Palestine. In 2019, for instance, Israel deducted US$43 million from the Palestinian Authority budget: a sum it claimed Palestine had paid to the families of Palestinians who had been jailed or killed as a result of attacking Israel.
Consequences for Palestinian people
Israel is using financial control as a tool of collective punishment against Palestine. It is a strategy that has severely harmed the Palestinian economy and, as a consequence, the wellbeing of its people. 
The World Bank estimates that 21% of the Palestinian population were already considered poor – living on just US$2.10 (£1.64) per day – on the eve of the second intifada. This figure had surged to about 60% by December 2002, two years after Israel suspended the delivery of tax revenue for a second time.

When tax revenues are withheld, many Palestinians are forced to reduce their food and educational expenditure, as well as their access to health services. For example, the average daily food consumption of a poor person in the West Bank and Gaza in 1998 was equivalent to US$1.47 per day. This had slipped to US$1.32 by early 2002 – a direct consequence of Israel withholding tax revenue for two years.
The cumulative effect of these suspensions has strangled the Palestinian economy and society, contributing to a cycle of poverty and deprivation. The new announcement will only exacerbate these conditions, worsening the plight of Palestinians in the region.

Theory of everything: how a fear of failure is hampering physicistsâ quest for the ultimate answer,https://theconversation.com/theory-of-everything-how-a-fear-of-failure-is-hampering-physicists-quest-for-the-ultimate-answer-230715,3027015,"Physics, Theory of Everything, Quantum gravity, Albert Einstein, Give me perspective","
It has been over a century since the boom period of physics exploded with Albert Einstein, Max Planck and others, sending us spinning into a new world of chaos from our previously ordered universe. This brilliant generation of physicists ultimately peeled back the layers of the universe, as well as of the atom, to reveal a world stranger than fiction.
Ever since those earliest days of quantum mechanics, the theory ruling the microworld of atoms and particles, the holy grail of physics has been finding a theory of everything – uniting quantum mechanics with Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which applies to the universe on large scales. 
But we still don’t have a tried and tested theory of everything. And I believe a fear of failure is a big part of the problem. 
Creating a theory of everything isn’t exactly easy. It involves producing one framework uniting the fundamental forces of our universe, while accounting for all the underlying constants and quantities as well as every subatomic particle. The prize for whoever answers this ultimate question is eternal glory in the annals of humankind.





There was great hunger to solve it in Einstein’s generation. In fact, Einstein worked on a theory of everything on his very deathbed – work that he was ultimately ridiculed for. Einstein’s contribution to physics was so great he still remains a superstar. But physicists Arthur Eddington, Hermann Weyl and mathematician David Hilbert were not so fortunate, with some facing much worse consequences. 
Take Eddington, for example, perhaps the greatest scientist you have never heard of. The Cambridge astronomer and physicist proved Einstein correct in his work analysing a 1919 eclipse – launching Einstein to superstardom. Eddington also wrote the first English books on relativity before doing the same on Georges Lemaître’s Big Bang theory.
He also wrote a book on quantum physics, and became the greatest popular writer on science in the 1920s and 1930s, alongside his groundbreaking work on stellar physics (the physics of stars). Yet he is obscure today due to his intense pursuit of a fundamental theory. 
Published posthumously, his attempt was immediately banished for its incredible failure. Mocked as numerology (the belief in a mystical relationship between a number and events), his strange interest in the power of certain numbers was made fun of by other scientists. And, as many notable astrophysicists have pointed out, it has produced no value since its publication. 
Eddington’s stunning final failure served as a powerful warning of the price that comes with missing the mark. The final decade of his life spent pursuing a theory of everything ended in severe damage to his legacy.
A new generation
The generation of the physicist Richard Feynman (1918–88), following that of Einstein and Eddington, lost interest in a theory of everything. Feynman and his peers found their own glory in new subatomic discoveries and theories, and applications of physics to chemistry and biology, leading to several Nobel prizes. The ridicule endured by those who tried and failed before them may have been one of the reasons.
This inordinate cost for failure ultimately rose alongside the glory of interwar physics. In a period of unparalleled success, failure was more unforgiving. This was hardly an incentive for young and brilliant modern minds seeking to apply themselves to the largest question.
Even today, attempts at theories of everything get mocked. String theory, for example, is such an attempt, and has been scorned by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose as not being real science.
He is not alone. Physicist Stephen Hawking believed a version of string theory called M-theory was our best option for a theory of everything. But the theory has struggled in producing predictions that can be tested by experiments. 

A young scientist today may wonder, if Einsteinx, Eddington and Hawking could not solve the problem, then who will? And indeed, many are doubtful that it can be achieved. Is it even necessary as, pragmatically, we can do without one?
It is no wonder, then, that many physicists prefer to avoid the term “theory of everything” these days, opting instead for less grandiose alternatives such as “quantum gravity”.
Funding and career progression
Alongside the heavy price of failure, other problems are lurking. A brilliant young mind could be staring at a career dead end in seeking out a theory of everything. What academic progression can one expect at the start of their career if this is desired? Who will give significant funding to young, unproven researchers pursuing a seemingly impossible goal in the short term?
It is likely that a theory of everything will ultimately require massive collaboration to be solved. Ironically, this may be a job for the older physicists, despite the warnings of Eddington and others. Francis Crick dedicated his attention to trying to solve the problem of consciousness in his later years, albeit without success. 
We need collaboration. But we may be looking at the prospect of a theory of everything only coming from those who have accomplished so much they can afford the potential embarrassment and will be given the benefit of the doubt. This hardly stirs the enthusiasm of the vibrant, young minds that may otherwise tackle the problem.
In trying to solve the ultimate problem, we may have inadvertently created a monster. Our academic framework for research progression is not conducive to it, and history has presented an unkind picture of what happens to those who try.
And yet, our greatest progress has always come from those willing to take risks.

Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga does little to address the franchiseâs frustrating attitude towards Australiaâs dark past,https://theconversation.com/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-does-little-to-address-the-franchises-frustrating-attitude-towards-australias-dark-past-230932,3027014,"Film, Australian history, Australian cinema, Mad Max, Give me perspective, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga","
In former British colonies like Australia, cinema has historically played an important cultural role in legitimising the presence of settlers. And from its relatively modest beginnings in the late 1970s to today’s billboard-hogging blockbuster franchise, the Mad Max series occupies a lofty place in the pantheon of this kind of cinema.
The latest film in the franchise, Furiosa, is the first to shift focus entirely away from the eponymous Max Rockatansky. Instead, it tells the gripping origin story of his chief rival in 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa (played by Anya Taylor-Joy). The film’s high-octane, non-stop action is interspersed with the kind of character development and myth-making befitting its full title, Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga. 
The precise space the Mad Max films occupy – both literally and cinematically – has always felt a little vague. Mad Max (1979) was set “a few years from now”, and offered only fleeting glimpses of the near-future meltdown that was central to its sequels, Mad Max 2 (1981) and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985).

      Turning the outback into post-apocalyptic wasteland: what Mad Max films tell us about filming in the Australian desert









In Furiosa, however, the film’s setting is made abundantly clear. A scene-setting prologue shows a rotating Earth, then zooms into an area on the eastern fringe of Australia’s red centre. With this, we arrive in a mythical oasis of abundance amid the “wasteland”. 
In Fury Road, we learned that our heroine was “stolen” from the Green Place of Many Mothers – a women-led refuge of verdant plenty amid a world ravaged by ecocide. That backstory is filled out in the latest film, which opens with a young Furiosa (Alyla Brown) being kidnapped by a party of wasteland scoundrels loyal to the quietly maniacal Dementus (Chris Hemsworth).

Mad Max as an Australian saga
For those familiar with Australia’s colonial past, the scenario may sound familiar. A young girl is stolen from a place of plenty, seemingly untouched by patriarchal violence and greed, in order to satisfy the impulses of some intrepid “explorers”. And yet, there remains a glaring absence of Indigenous people and culture at the heart of the Mad Max films. 
While First Nations actors in the series have been few and far between (sometimes making literal “blink and you’ll miss it” appearences), a clear effort at diverse casting was made this time around. 
Noongar-Yamatji actor Clarence Ryan appears as Black Thumb, the ill-fated assistant to “War Rig” driver Pretorian Jack (Tom Burke). Meanwhile, Murri teenager Quaden Bayles plays a war pup, responsible for kick-starting the rig’s secret weapon. 

Perhaps it would be unfair to expect the Australian director George Miller, or his blockbuster films, to right historical wrongs. He seems to prefer broad “hero’s journey” brushstrokes to grappling with real history. 
Nonetheless, the Mad Max films have always had a “very intriguing attitude” to Australian history. And there is something slightly troubling about a director who – despite demonstrating an awareness of Aboriginal history, stories and traditions – makes a film that centres on a white child who is “stolen”, as opposed to one that is merely “lost”.
For much of the 20th century, Australia made no efforts to hide the government policies that encouraged the removal of First Nations children from their families. So-called protection and assimilation policies were central to state and federal efforts to deal with what was openly called “the Aboriginal problem”. 
When the first phase of settler colonisation failed in its attempts to wipe out First Nations populations, attention turned to efforts to “breed out the black”. Eugenicists were enlisted to justify decades of racist government policy in which Aboriginal children were removed from their families. These children came to be known as the “stolen generations”. 

Despite an official apology from the government in 2008, very little has changed for those affected, or those children who continue to be disproportionately removed by government agencies. 
All the talk, now, is of another Fury Road prequel, this time focusing on Max himself. But what if, instead, Miller handed the reins over to a team of First Nations filmmakers, and let them offer an alternative perspective on the wasteland? Now that would be something to behold.

How to know when itâs time to quit therapy,https://theconversation.com/how-to-know-when-its-time-to-quit-therapy-230800,3027013,"Mental health, Therapy, online therapy, Quarter Life, Educate me","
Therapy is great. It gives you the space, time and resources to handle the most difficult challenges of life. Therapy can be especially helpful in the often-confusing life period of your 20s and 30s, when so much is changing and many of your peers have wildly different lifestyles. 
The aim is to help you discover the thoughts, emotions and behaviour that are negatively affecting you, determine where these come from, and develop strategies to change them. But then, how do you know when it is the right time to quit therapy?
First, you must consider whether you want to quit therapy altogether, or just quit your current therapist.
Psychotherapy (therapy that specifically aims to treat mental health) is generally equally or more effective for treating mental health problems than medication. Psychotherapy is also generally more effective at preventing relapse (a return to poor mental health after improvement) than medication. 





However, this is not always the case. Occasionally, in about 5-10% of cases, therapy can have adverse effects. These could be a deterioration in symptoms, physical wellbeing, ability to work and function, mood, life satisfaction, relationships, sleep or self-esteem. Not all talking therapies come under the bracket of clinical psychotherapy, but the principles of how and why you should stop them are the same.


No one’s 20s and 30s look the same. You might be saving for a mortgage or just struggling to pay rent. You could be swiping dating apps, or trying to understand childcare. No matter your current challenges, our Quarter Life series has articles to share in the group chat, or just to remind you that you’re not alone.

Adverse effects can occur when there is a breakdown in the therapist-client relationship. If you do not trust your therapist, have experienced damaging interactions with them, feel they do not have your best interests at heart, think the therapy they provide is ineffective, or generally think they are not the right fit for you, then it might be time to move on.
This does not mean therapy will not work for you – just that this particular therapist did not. It might also not mean the therapist is a bad therapist. They all have different specialisations, personalities, styles and preferred therapeutic methods. Do not be afraid to search until you find a therapist who is right for you.
On the other hand, if you feel bonded with, supported and guided by your therapist but are still not seeing the progress you would like, then you should consider whether your expectations are unrealistic. 
Are you looking for quick, easy answers? Are you trying to achieve some “perfect” ideal? Are you applying strategies you have learned outside of therapy? And are you being honest with your therapist about what is or isn’t working for you? Therapy takes time, effort, collaboration and an attainable goal.
Consider why you’re going to therapy
If you are attending therapy for something that is timely – to help you deal with a particular problem or difficult phase in your life – then you can finish therapy whenever you feel you have met your goal. For example, if you are going through a nasty breakup, grieving a loved one, or trying to save a relationship, then you finish therapy once you have worked through those emotions and have the tools to move forward.
It can be more difficult to know when to quit therapy when the problem is ongoing. Mental illness typically is not something that can be “fixed” or “cured” with treatment. The goal then is not just achieving a state of emotional or psychological wellness, but also maintaining that state.

It can help to break therapy down into two phases: the acute phase and the maintenance phase. 
The acute phase is when you are not doing well. This includes your symptoms at their worst, and as they improve over the course of treatment. During this time, the duration, intensity and frequency of therapy is probably greater. 
Once you have achieved a relatively stable state of wellness, you enter the maintenance phase where the goal changes to maintaining these gains you have aready made. During this phase, you probably won’t need to be seen as often. 
If you have reached this phase and are wondering whether this counts as “finishing” therapy, the answer is: sort of. Try cutting back to a session once every two weeks, then once a month and so on until you are seeking therapy only as often as you need to.
The important thing to remember is that mental illness, and life, is full of ups and downs. If you find yourself falling back into old patterns or feeling anxious, depressed, out of control or otherwise mentally unwell, that is OK! It is not your fault. Therapy will be right there to pick you back up and get you on your way to feeling well again.

The UKâs power grid needs upgrading to reach net zero â our new study shows where,https://theconversation.com/the-uks-power-grid-needs-upgrading-to-reach-net-zero-our-new-study-shows-where-226346,3027012,"Electricity, Renewable energy, Solar panels, Power grid, Energy transition, Heat pumps, Power cuts, Net zero emissions, Educate me, Electric vehicles (EVs)","
To reduce its emissions in line with national and global targets, the UK must overhaul how it produces, uses and distributes electricity. 
Millions of heat pumps, electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels are planned in the UK. These can reduce emissions and lower household bills. However, they will also substantially raise the amount of power neighbourhoods need over coming decades, particularly during peak demand periods like early evening. At other times, when the Sun is shining and electricity use is low, solar panels on homes and businesses could allow neighbourhoods to export electricity to the network.
Much of the UK’s electricity network was built in the 1950s and needs upgrading to accommodate this level of electricity usage. Around 15% of cables and almost half of substations may need replacing to meet the UK’s net zero goal. 
Understanding how this will affect electricity networks on a street-by-street level is challenging. Houses and businesses are distributed differently within areas. Likewise, electricity networks are configured differently and will serve varying numbers of electric appliances. This will all affect whether existing networks are able to handle changes to electricity demand, and the parts of these networks that need upgrading.





Grid upgrades will be most severe in cities
My colleagues and I have mapped the places where the grid is most likely to need upgrades in the transition to net zero. Our maps depict the density of homes and small businesses, the arrangement of existing cables and substations, and the quantity of heat pumps, EVs and solar panels – now and in the future. 

Some areas have more public transport use and fewer cars, implying fewer EVs. Areas where heat networks are planned (pipes bringing hot water directly into homes from a central source like a power plant) are likely to see fewer heat pumps installed, whereas rural areas have more space for solar panels. 
Some of this information was drawn from National Grid and other operators. The scenario our research paints is not assured – different regions may deploy more or less green technologies. For example, a local network operator may assume higher EV uptake than elsewhere, or a local authority may decide to focus on heat networks rather than heat pumps.
However, our modelling shows that necessary upgrades to local networks will be more widespread and costly in urban areas. Cables are longer and reach more households and businesses in cities, and there are fewer substations per household. These networks already transfer large amounts of electricity and are more likely to overload as demand for clean electricity grows.
What’s more, cables in rural areas typically run overhead with substations mounted on poles, making them easier to replace. In cities, the task is more difficult (and expensive) as cables usually run underground.

How the public can help
Network upgrades require labour and cost money. If there is a way to avoid doing this without obstructing the transition to a low-carbon energy system, it could save money and help to reduce emissions quicker. 
In some places, increasing demand for clean electricity will push local networks far beyond their present capabilities, so upgrades will be the only option. But where networks are not overburdened, upgrades could be avoided by people reducing how much electricity they use during peak times. Households could shift when they charge an EV, wash clothes, vacuum or bake. 
Another way to lower electricity demand is by increasing energy efficiency: switching to more efficient lighting and appliances, or insulating homes to allow for smaller heat pumps. Homes or small businesses with installed batteries or plugged-in EVs can set them up to automatically discharge stored power to the grid at peak times.
Households and businesses can already get discounts on their energy bills for doing this. This was successfully trialled to reduce renewable electricity demand at times when it is difficult to generate enough of it across the country, such as on winter evenings when there is little wind.

Similar schemes could provide additional discounts or pay households and businesses to reduce electricity use where networks are constrained. Our modelling suggests that reducing electricity use would be particularly effective in the most densely populated areas of central London.
Households and small businesses can play an important part in decarbonising the UK’s power network. Maps can show where these opportunities are in different regions, and help authorities see where they should be focusing their efforts in the race to meet the UK’s net zero emissions target.

âEntrepreneurial spiritâ: A product of nature or nurture?,https://theconversation.com/entrepreneurial-spirit-a-product-of-nature-or-nurture-230799,3026897,"Nature vs nurture, The Conversation Europe, Entrepreurship","
The concept of cultural entrepreneurship has many facets. It encompasses both the cultural and social impact of entrepreneurial training, and the environmental factors that influence its development.
Some societies, such as the USA, have a strong entrepreneurial culture. This means that certain characteristics are celebrated and encouraged, such as the ability of individuals to assume risks, patience when confronting challenges, and innovative problem solving, especially in uncertain situations. However, not all countries have such an entrepreneurial culture.
Entrepreneurship struggles to take off in Europe
In general, entrepreneurship can drive economic growth within countries, especially in high-income nations. 
The Total Early-Stage Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) is an index that measures entrepreneurial activity. It does this by recording all new businesses established within the last three years in a given country. Countries with an entrepreneurial tradition such as the USA or Canada, for example, have TEAs of 14.7% and 19.76%, respectively. The figures are similar for other emerging powers such as Brazil (18.6%), Mexico (16.8%) or Saudi Arabia (25.34%). 





In Europe, entrepreneurship is a key factor in stimulating economic growth, but no country in the continent reaches the figures of other more entrepreneurial markets. According to Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, only Latvia comes close with 14.34%, followed by the Netherlands with 13.69%, Croatia with 13.15% and Estonia with 13.09%. 
Many countries sit well below 13%, including the United Kingdom (11.76%), Cyprus (11.04%), and France and Slovakia (both with 10.75%). Meanwhile, at the tail end of European entrepreneurship are Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Greece and Spain, with 2.59%, 5.85%, 6.68%, 6,74% and 6.79%, respectively. 
Cultural entrepreneurship
Over the years, various studies have developed models to improve understanding of the cultural dimensions of entrepreneurship, with the aim of analysing why some cultures or countries produce more entrepreneurs than others. They have found, for example, that a society whose population is less risk averse should, in theory, have stronger entrepreneurial values.
However, cultural differences cannot be considered in isolation. We also have to look at a society’s economic situation, bearing in mind several key points: 

According to traditional economic thought, fear impacts entrepreneurship more when an economy is in recession. This is natural, given that an economic downturn reduces the overall number of business opportunities. 
The Global Entrepreneurship Index has shown how countries with more favourable economic climates tend to perform better in terms of entrepreneurship.
Some studies have shown that a person is much more likely to become an entrepreneur if their parents, friends or neighbours are also entrepreneurs, or encourage them to become one. This is due, in part, to the fact that 80% of the times someone is encouraged to become an entrepreneur, friends, family or acquaintances provide a source of finance. 

What do you need to become an entrepreneur?
The characteristics and attributes that are shared among business-minded people make up what some researchers call “entrepreneurial spirit”, with certain traits and motivations playing a very important role. 
Personality-wise, natural entrepreneurs are more likely to accept challenges and achieve results. They are curious, self-motivated people who are more interested in working for their own benefit than in external recognition. They also have a greater need for autonomy, and a desire to find better ways of doing things. 
Motivation can be broken down into two especially important areas:

Reward: making a difference to the world, making a living in difficult circumstances, and the possibility of greater economic incentive.
Professional objectives or past experience: continuing a family business, the desire to “be your own boss”. 

Entrepreneurship: nature or nurture?
Many people do an excellent job as employees, but would feel overwhelmed at the thought of starting their own business. 
Entrepreneurial spirit mitigates or bypasses this fear of failure – a perfectly natural reaction to the uncertainty and risk involved in making decisions and pursuing goals.
Some authors argue that “nurture” – meaning circumstances, experiences and learning – plays an important role in shaping entrepreneurs. Others, however, emphasise the influence of personality traits, suggesting a greater inclination towards a “nature” perspective. 
Enterprising talent
While opinions vary, it is clear that successful entrepreneurs are the result of a combination of innate characteristics and environmental factors. Nevertheless, starting and running a business will come more naturally to those who have a clear, innate vocation towards entrepreneurship. 
Just as no one can become an Olympic athlete without the necessary talent, entrepreneurship requires a unique combination of skills and dispositions that not everyone naturally shares. However, this does not mean that effort and sacrifice are not also fundamental to entrepreneurial success.

Albanese government gives new Ministerial Direction on visa appeals to make âcommunity safetyâ paramount,https://theconversation.com/albanese-government-gives-new-ministerial-direction-on-visa-appeals-to-make-community-safety-paramount-231175,3026664,"Immigration, Migration, Home Affairs, Clare O'Neil, Andrew Giles, non-citizens, NZYQ","
The Albanese government is giving a new  “Ministerial Direction” to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on visa cases, telling it to make community safety paramount in considering appeals from non-citizens with serious criminal records. 
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced the change in Question Time on Wednesday. 
The Direction will apply not just to the AAT (which will be reconstituted as the Administrative Review Tribunal (ART) under legislation which this week passed through parliament) but also to all decision-makers in the Home Affairs Department.
This followed a political fracas over revelations that many criminals have had the cancellations of their visas overturned after a policy change by the Albanese government’s early last year. 





That change was made at the request of then New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who pressed for New Zealanders with long associations with Australia not to be deported. 
The Direction to the AAT – which reviews decisions on visa cancellations – was changed to elevate, among the other criteria to be taken into account, the strength, nature and duration of  their ties to Australia. 
Immigration Minister Andrew Giles has been under sustained attack this week, as the opposition has highlighted multiple instances of the AAT upholding the appeals of those convicted of major crimes.   
In question time on Wednesday the opposition asked about a number of foreign nationals, from various countries, convicted of crimes including rape, domestic violence and assault, whose appeals had been upheld by the AAT.
The Coalition has repeatedly called for Giles to be sacked from his post. The latest row follows a string of earlier issues around the former detainees, released from immigration detention as a result of a High Court decision last year. 
The Minister for Home Affairs, Clare O'Neil, who is the senior minister in the portfolio, said on Wednesday morning TV, “It does appear that the decisions made by this independent tribunal are not meeting community expectations”. There was not enough stress being put on community safety, she said. 
She said she found the tribunal’s decisions “very disconcerting”.
Giles has already re-cancelled some half dozen of the visas.  
The Secretary of the Home Affairs department, Stephanie Foster, admitted to a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday that the department had failed to inform Giles of the AAT decisions. This was despite having undertaken to do so. 
O'Neil admitted some issues within the department had been of concern. 
But she said the “urgent matter ahead of us is to get Minister Giles to reconsider these visas, as he has indicated that he’s doing, to make sure that we can […] ensure that community standards are being met in visa decisions”. 
Announcing the rewriting of the Ministerial Direction, Albanese told parliament: “The only effective way of ensuring the tribunal members are making better decisions is to issue a new revised Direction, which the minister will be doing. The new directive will ensure [community protection] outweighs any other consideration.”
Giles told the ABC he had “instructed my department to advise me and my office within 24 hours now of any such decision of the administrative appeals tribunal”.
“The new, revised Direction, will make it abundantly clear community safety is a consideration that outweighs all other considerations. And beyond that […] we will introduce further mechanisms to enable the perspective of victims and their families to be more clearly brought to bear.”

Politics with Michelle Grattan: Andrew Norton on the Albanese governmentâs interventionist policy to cut foreign student numbers,https://theconversation.com/politics-with-michelle-grattan-andrew-norton-on-the-albanese-governments-interventionist-policy-to-cut-foreign-student-numbers-231176,3026573,"Universities, Migration, International students, Politics with Michelle Grattan, Jason Clare, Budget 2024","
Migration has become a major battleground between the government and opposition. While they have different policies, each side is targeting foreign students in their plans for cuts in the intake.  
The government will apply caps, decided by the minister, on the numbers of foreign students for particular universities, with some concessions for those institutions investing in new student accommodation. 
Andrew Norton, professor in the practice of higher education policy at the ANU, joined the podcast to dissect the policy.  
He stresses how wide the minister’s prerogative under the policy will be:






The government has announced that it’s going to give the minister the power to set caps on the number of international students, and he can do this by education provider, by course, by location and any other matter he decides to choose to do. So very broad powers for the minister to decide essentially how big the industry will be in total and how big any provider can be. 

The universities’ locations will be significant for their likely caps:

I think it will be tougher on some than others and the reason for that is […] the accommodation crisis in major cities, particularly Melbourne and Sydney. 
What it means is there’ll be significant caps, probably within the metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne, and possibly no caps at all in regional universities because they don’t have these same problems. But of course we know that only a relatively small number of international students want to study in the Australian regions.

The government is also continuing a push to combat “ghost colleges”, which have presented challenges to governments’ attempts to curb them:

A ghost college is essentially a college set up, possibly in collaboration with the migration agent. The students don’t want to study. They just want to work in Australia and so they have this semi-fake enrolment in a ghost college, which enables them to work full-time. 
There are about 800 of these private vocational colleges that can take international students. I think most of them are honest, but there’s probably dozens that are not, and so the government is trying to crack down on these and basically get them out of the market.  
They are masters at looking for loopholes and one of the things the government is doing now is basically stopping registration of them for a year or so, just to try and get a handle on the ones we’ve got now.

The fee structure of universities, which was changed under Scott Morrison to increase costs for the humanities, hasn’t been changed under Labor; Norton gives us a reason why:

It’s hard to do it in a budget-neutral way. I think that the coalition booby-trapped this policy. So they are charging about $16,000 a year to do an arts degree but only about $4,500 a year to do nursing or teaching, and so to make this budget neutral, they would need to increase fees for teaching and nursing, which is obviously not a good political idea when you’re trying to encourage people to go into those courses. And so that’s what I think they’ve been paralysed by.

"Norway, Ireland, Spain recognise the state of Palestine pressuring others to follow suit as IDF continues assault on Gaza",https://theconversation.com/norway-ireland-spain-recognise-the-state-of-palestine-pressuring-others-to-follow-suit-as-idf-continues-assault-on-gaza-231089,3026572,"European Commission, European parliament (EP), European Council of Ministers, Give me perspective, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Palestinian statehood","
Ireland, Spain and Norway have broken with the majority of European states by formally recognising Palestine as an independent state. This follows the Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Barbados that did the same earlier this year, bringing the number of UN members that recognise Palestine to 143 out of 193.  
On May 10, the UN general assembly adopted a resolution giving new rights to Palestine within the organisation and calling on the security council to admit it as a full member. This has not happened yet because the US keeps vetoing the decision. 
But, unlike the vast majority of UN member states that supported the resolution, most EU members did not. Indeed, still, most European states do not recognise a Palestinian state, and the war in Gaza has made the differences in how EU member states treat Palestine obvious. As a result, Spain’s wishes for a joint recognition by EU member states have not been possible. Such big decisions require consensus – and currently there isn’t one among EU governments. 
This is not to say that the EU is completely neutral on Palestinian statehood. The European Council supports the right of Palestinians to have a state alongside that of Israel, although recently the president of the council came out in favour of full recognition. And, for years, the EU has given money and expertise to try to assist in building a Palestinian state – but has stopped short of recognising it. 





This lack of consensus has undermined political support for EU peace initiatives in the region. That’s despite the fact the European Commission has been engaged in the peace process and has reaffirmed its commitment to a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, most recently by proposing a ten-point roadmap. 
This is not the only time the sensitive issue of recognition has created divisions among EU members. EU governments have also not managed to agree on a common position on the statehood of Kosovo, which declared independence in 2008.
The European parliament
Unlike decisions at the European Council, European parliament decisions do not require consensus. This is one of the reasons the assembly has had a stronger and more positive voice on Palestinian statehood. 
Strictly speaking, the European parliament does not have the official capacity to recognise states (this is something mostly done by governments). And yet, for a decade now the parliament has expressed support for the recognition of Palestinian statehood and the two-state solution. It has said that recognition should happen simultaneously with the development of peace talks.
The European parliament resolution also condemned Israel’s illegal settlements and called on the EU to contribute actively to the Middle East peace process. It also proposed the creation of the “Parliamentarians for Peace” initiative, to promote the dialogue between MEPs and Israeli and Palestinians parliamentarians.
Indeed, our research shows that setting up delegations with those seeking recognition as states is another avenue through which the European parliament has been important for recognition matters. The European parliament mantains a delegation for working with parliamentarians of the Palestinian state. 

Over the past few months, this delegation has met to discuss the impact of the war on Gaza and the West Bank. Members of the delegation are some of the most vocal supporters of Palestinian rights in the EU. For example, the chair of the delegation has condemned Israel’s war on Gaza, the killing of Palestinians during aid distribution or the suspension of Unrwa funding by some donor countries. 
The European parliament has also hosted robust debates on Palestine. Shortly after a resolution passed by the European parliament favouring Palestinian statehood, the president of the Palestinian authority, Mahmoud Abbas visited the European parliament and thanked MEPs for their recognition. 
In recent debates on the humanitarian situation in Gaza, there have been different opinions in the chamber. The majority of the parliament voted in favour of a resolution calling for a ceasefire, the immediate release of all hostages and the dismantling of Hamas. But parliamentarians from the left voted against the resolution arguing that making the ceasefire conditional on the end of Hamas would mean that “the resolution stands with Israel”. 
Who’s next?
Could the European parliament’s support for Palestine and the recent recognitions by major European states mean that more European states change their position? When, in 2014, Sweden recognised Palestine, hopes that other EU member states would do the same were disappointed. But this time things might be different. The coordination of recognition by Ireland, Norway and Spain might create the necessary momentum. 
Reports suggest that Malta and Slovenia and Belgium are considering following suit, while eyes will also be on big players including France and the UK. The fact that the new recognitions have been done in the name of supporting a two-state solution – something that is generally favoured by European states – might also strengthen the hand of those states now keener to recognise a Palestinian state. It will exert pressure on more sceptical European capitals to reconsider.

"The sensuous, yet unsettling: remembering the groundbreaking Australian photographer Rosemary Laing",https://theconversation.com/the-sensuous-yet-unsettling-remembering-the-groundbreaking-australian-photographer-rosemary-laing-231157,3026252,"Photography, Visual art, Obituary, Australian artists, Visual art and design","

A ‘swansong’ is a metaphor for an action or a performance prior to an ending. The term conveys the notion of something both grand and final.

This was the opening paragraph, written by curator Victoria Lynn, for the catalogue accompanying Rosemary Laing’s exhibition swansongs, at Tolarno Galleries in March of this year. Ironically the title was apt. It was Laing’s last exhibition before her untimely death after a short illness at age 65.
The Australian photographer and former educator originally trained as a painter and brought a certain sensibility of the painter’s hand to her practice. 
Photography enabled her to challenge how we think about social, cultural, and historical issues because of the medium’s relationship to reality. 
Her unique approach engaged with the nature of place, inhabitation and Australia’s colonial history, but also to technology, time and speed – elements seen in her work since the 1980s.





Known for her groundbreaking photo-media series flight research (1999) and bulletproofglass (2002), her work came to be “embedded in our psyche,” as Melbourne’s Tolarno Galleries has commented.

Interventions in the landscape
Like a 19th century painter, Laing often worked en plein air, eschewing the studio to respond to the landscape with certain interventions that laid bare our ongoing impact on nature. 
Such works of intense, persistent labour saw her travelling to the southern alps of New Zealand in 2018 to produce skyground. 
These sensuous, yet unsettling images undo what we think the landscape should look like. When hung, they appear inverted: the ground above and the sky below, relaying a “sense of slow-motion disaster,” as artist and writer Tanya Peterson has referred to it. 

Laing’s concern with natural and unnatural disasters can be traced through a number of photographic series that draw our attention to weather, floods, bushfires, pollution, land degradation, but also to colonisation. 
Buddens (2017) and Groundspeed (2001) are incongruous in their clash of nature, domesticity and industrial labour. 
In Buddens, Laing replaced the river’s flow through the landscape of Wreck Bay with discarded red-toned clothes recalling the debris left behind in floods or ship disasters. In Groundspeed, Laing meticulously laid Feltex carpet patterned with European floral motifs across the forest floor.

In effort + rush (2015), Laing takes us to Madagascar, where Laing had to reconcile the expected consumptive tourist image with the devastated landscape. Images capture the rush of bushfires devouring the earth. 
Using the camera as a paintbrush, these works remind us of the force of nature but also of human destruction, often seen in a blur as we race through the landscape in speeding vehicles.

The intersection of nature and culture with technology and speed can be seen in brownwork (1996–97), described by curator Blair French as picturing flight in a contradictory state of being, and greenwork (1995), which saw her producing large-scale documentary and staged images. 
Experimenting with digital interventions and time-lapse, Laing encapsulated “fluid abstractions of flight,” as she called it in a 1998 interview in Art & Text. 
In some photographs we see the residue of plane jet streams held in a strange state between stasis and flux. In others, the vivid green forests seemingly rupture from a moment of stillness into motion in a rare digital intervention.   

Dark histories
Laing was also deeply affected by the intersection of nature and the dark, shameful history of Australia’s treatment of its First peoples, its migrants and refugees. As she commented:

the arrival of people, throughout history, shifts what happens in land, challenging those who have left their elsewhere, and disrupting the continuum of their destination place. A disruption causes a reconfiguration. It elaborates both the beforehand and the afterward.

Her photographic series swansongs (2024) and poems for recent times (2021) reflect on the horrific, unsettling Black Summer bushfires that raged across the Shoalhaven and neighbouring regions in 2019–20, which saw Laing move to the studio for these contemplative works.

What at first look not unlike traditional still-life paintings in poems for recent times, Laing embeds these images with unquiet signs of repair in bandaged twigs, and loss and remembrance in floral tributes,  along with signs of new life rising from the ashes. 
This sense of unquiet was personal for Laing as she and her partner, artist Geoff Kleem, watched on as the fires crept up to the edges of the lake near their home.
Three years later, Laing continued this concern in swansongs, with assemblages of crustaceans animated by reparative interventions; bandages or “everyday things that mend, bind or heal a wound,” as Victoria Lynn writes. 

The exhibition featured photographs that capture suspended crustacean shellwork in vivid arrangements set against the photographic background of previous series, along with the shellwork subjects positioned on precarious shelves. 
The sense of recuperation, recycling and repair in these works reminds of the fragility of life, but also of European impact on Australia’s nature and its first inhabitants.
Making us look
As Laing said of swansongs, the photographs relate to 

a love of, an attachment to, homeland or places of belonging … all the memories and histories that have stemmed from that place, and the making of a kind of ‘song’ that combines the enigma of this attachment with a sadness for what has happened in this place.

The last time I saw Rosemary, we were yet again talking incessantly about photography and looking at the numerous photographs of sunsets at Swan Lake on her phone; “Look at this one, and this… and what about the colour in this…” she said. 
Always looking, always making us look.

Taylor-Joy has only 30 lines of dialogue, but in the first half of the film Furiosa is played (admirably) by a younger actor, Alyla Browne. 
But even when Furiosa doesn’t speak, the new films are a huge step forward for the portrayal of women’s stories in the Mad Max world. 

Science-fiction disaster films
Max is silent for much of the first four films and he does not appear in Furiosa (if you discount the glimpse we see of him on a hillside). Our heroes have little to say with words, but the villains are more verbose. In Furiosa, Hemsworth’s Dementous is objectionably loquacious. 





The early Mad Max films are largely uninterested in women. After his wife Jessie dies in the first film, Max shows no interest in women sexually. But there is an underlying theme relating to the survival and fertility of women, while keeping the narrative focus firmly on the men.
One way to read the Mad Max film cycle is as an Antipodean response to themes first explored in 1950s science-fiction disaster films such as Five (1951), Captive Women (1952), World Without End (1956) and Last Woman on Earth (1960). In these films, nuclear destruction results in an environmentally devastated world where male survivors compete for access to resources like fuel, technology and fertile women. 

In the first Mad Max film, from 1979, as civilisation descends into chaos, women and families are quickly eliminated. Bikers kill Max’s wife and son. Fleeting appearances of other women like bikie “molls” or victims of sexual assaults on the road highlight how women are marginalised. The last woman to appear in the first film is May, an the old woman who attempts to help the Rockatansky family, but in her hands both a car and a shotgun are ineffectual.
In Mad Max 2 (1981), once the able Warrior Woman dies in battle, the role of the few surviving female characters is reproductive. Curmudgeon informs Max the survivors’ chief function will be performed in Queensland, where they will be required to “breeeeeed”. 
Despite Tina Turner’s star presence in Beyond Thunderdome (1985) as an “aunty” rather than a mother-figure, women continue to play secondary roles to Max and to the vehicular action, with just hints that Savannah Nix, the leader of the lost children, may signal a future where women have more power and agency.

Women get star billing
Furiosa has good reason to stay silent. This latest film traces how, as a young girl and a woman, she is held captive first by Dementous and then by Immortan Joe. 
Her silence is strategic: it lends her power, and disguises her gender when she reaches puberty. Furiosa understands that, unless she is able to fight and drive, her function will be to bear children. When she attracts sexual attention, she disguises herself as a boy and learns how to drive and how to assemble a vehicle. 

These are the skills that will ensure her survival and eventual hero status. Better to be a prize driver than one of Joe’s “prize breeders”. We learn more about her character when we witness how she loses her arm than could possibly be articulated by dialogue.
What is more interesting than Furiosa’s selective muteness in both recent films is her star billing and her status as a driver and a warrior. Decades after the original films, women finally get significant screen time. 
In the fourth film, Fury Road (2015), Max not only shares the role of protagonist and heroic driver with Furiosa (here played by Charlize Theron), but most of the central characters are women: the Five Wives, the Valkyrie and the Many Mothers (wizened competent bikies) are members of the Vuvalini tribe from the Green Place. 
Apart from the first scene where the War Boys pursue Max, almost every frame in Fury Road includes a woman as a central part of the action. This continues in Furiosa.

Again echoing tropes established in 1950s sci-fi, in both Furiosa and Fury Road a healthy womb is a valuable commodity. 
Much like cars are treated as spare parts throughout the series, and in films like The Cars that Ate Paris (1974), humans are tagged with tattoos listing their viable parts and are traded as “blood bags”. Joe’s treasures in Fury Road are beautiful young women he selects as breeding stock. He keeps his Five Wives captive in a chamber resembling a giant bank vault.
By shifting the focus of the Mad Max films from the men to the women, we finally have a complex portrayal of the women in this environment and their reduction to their reproductive possibilities.
It isn’t without its problems. At various points in Fury Road, the wives – clad in bikinis and chastity belts as if straight off a Victoria’s Secret catwalk – repeat mantras protesting their objectification and lack of agency in this toxic patriarchy. Yet while the film speaks criticism of objectification, it profits off that same objectification. Miller draws our attention to the exploitation of women and how they are treated as aesthetic breeders while offering up scantily clad models.
Despite this double standard, it is thrilling to see Browne and Taylor-Joy centre stage as warriors driving the rig and the narrative in Furiosa. This is progress – if we remember that bikinis as well as car crashes sell cinema tickets.

We know the seas are rising â so why are Australian governments not planning for it?,https://theconversation.com/we-know-the-seas-are-rising-so-why-are-australian-governments-not-planning-for-it-230944,3026161,"Climate change, Environment, Sea level rise, Storm surge, Managed retreat, Coastlines","
The vast majority of Australians (87%) live within 50 kilometres of a coastline. The coast offers scenery, swimming and cooling from the sea. 
But the problem is, coastlines as we know them are going to change. Sea-level rise is accelerating. As seas inch higher, storm surges can reach further inland and coastal erosion intensifies. Australia’s coasts are not immune. 
Low-lying areas are particularly vulnerable, such as towns around Western Port Bay in Victoria. 
So why aren’t we planning for what will happen? In this year’s federal budget funds were allocated to many long-term needs, such as submarines for defence (around a 20-year timeframe), the Inland Rail project for freight (around 15 years), Sunshine Coast rail link for transport (at least 10 years) and long term policies for green manufacturing. State budgets also make long-term commitments. 
But there was nothing to prepare our coastal communities for the water. Sea level rise and storm surge are problems which get steadily worse. If we spend to avoid A$1 billion of damage in 2040, that’s the same as avoiding $4 billion in 2070 and $10 billion by 2100, according to the Kompas report released last year by co-author Tom Kompas and colleagues. 

The economic costs are known
If we don’t prepare, we risk damage to housing, the environment, towns and fast-growing coastal and marine industries. 
What does sea-level rise cost? The Kompas report found within 75 years, the projected sea-level rise of 0.82 metres coupled with 19% more storm surges would cause staggering economic loss in Victoria, to the tune of $442 billion, flooding 45,000 hectares of inhabited land and affecting almost every coastal community. 
Overseas, the scale of the problem is staggering. Estimates for damage to coastal towns and cities in the European Union and United Kingdom are up to $1.4 trillion.
Why aren’t we taking this seriously?
It is good practice to strategically plan for known risks and needs. And we do make long-term plans in many areas. But so far, coastal adaptation is not one of them. 
Because greenhouse gas emissions aren’t dropping as needed, we have already locked in a certain level of sea-level rise. That’s because there’s a lag time between emitting gases, warming the atmosphere and oceans, and melting ice flowing into seas.  
What does adaptation look like? We have six options: 
1. Non-intervention: authorities deliberately let impacts occur. You might use this strategy if it would be too expensive or impossible to protect a coastal area, or if there are no people living there. 
2. Avoid: make sure new houses, infrastructure and human uses for coastline are moved away from the area to be affected. 
In Australia, local or state-wide sea-level planning benchmarks are used to denote areas where permanent development needs justification. Benchmarks and assessments differ markedly around the nation. 
3. Nature-based methods: boost or restore natural systems able to reduce damage.
This method involves working to bring back or improve natural habitats such as coral reefs, sand, shellfish reefs, mangroves, wetlands, saltmarshes, or seagrasses to build up sediment, adding height and natural ways to absorb some of the force of higher seas. 
Many Australian states already have examples up and running. In the EU, the REST-COAST program is working on many nature-based restoration projects, while the United States has many examples, such as oyster reef restoration. 
4. Managed retreat: relocate away from the danger.
The community of Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana was the first community globally to retreat inland in a planned way. In Vietnam, farms and villages in Hue province have had to relocate away from the sea. 
While no Australian community has gone through a managed retreat due to sea level, the Summerlands estate on Phillip Island was relocated to protect Australia’s most famous penguin colony.  
5. Accommodate: rebuild to reduce risk. 
When disaster strikes, it makes sense to rebuild to reduce future risk. Australian authorities often use this technique after river floods. But there are no known examples of similar work on our coasts. In the US, areas of New Orleans were rebuilt to let future floodwaters escape rather than stay trapped for weeks, as they did after Hurricane Katrina.
6. Protect: build hard physical barriers to stop the water getting through. 
Historically, building seawalls and dikes has been the first response authorities reach for. The problem is, these barriers are expensive to build and maintain, especially at the scale that will be needed. 

Where to from here?
What will nudge authorities to start preparing in earnest? Time, for one. As sea-level rise accelerates, authorities will have to act. 
But acting late is much more expensive than acting early. We need to avoid the Tragedy of the Horizon, where catastrophe seems far enough away in time that we can delay acting. 
What our policymakers need is the social license to act. The planned retreat of the Welsh town of Fairbourne became controversial because when the council’s plans became public, house values plummeted. 
To be able to focus on coastal adaptation means decoupling from the political cycle so politicians are supported to make hard but necessary decisions in the interests of the next generation. 
A national approach would help. Not everywhere can be protected. It makes sense to focus our efforts on places where many people live, or the special habitats we want to keep. 
If we keep putting our heads in the sand, we’ll get soaked.

Is Australia doing enough to respond to Papua New Guineaâs catastrophic landslide?,https://theconversation.com/is-australia-doing-enough-to-respond-to-papua-new-guineas-catastrophic-landslide-230981,3026160,"Natural disasters, Papua New Guinea","
The total number of people killed in the landslide in Papua New Guinea’s remote and mountainous Enga Province will probably never be known. Shortly after the entire hillside collapsed on Friday, it was speculated around 150 men, women and children had lost their lives. Such a death toll is tragic in itself, but as the days have passed, the numbers have continued to grow. 
At the time of writing, the PNG government is reporting the toll exceeds 2,000, making this one of the most catastrophic events in the history of the nation. 
Of course, the number of lives lost is only one, crude way of measuring the impact of disasters. Behind each of these deaths are lost livelihoods, broken families  and even more poverty. The effects will last for years, even decades.
A nation familiar with natural disasters
By this grisly measure, the Enga landslide is up there with the eruption of Mt Lamington in January 1951. The eruption took the lives of at least 2,900 people. Many were killed by the superheated gases and volcanic material that spewed out of the mountain’s side. 





It is also comparable to a more recent event, 1998’s Aitape tsunami, thought to have caused the deaths of up to 2,200 people on PNG’s northern coastline. At least 500 died from an eruption of the volcanoes surrounding Rabaul in 1937, and around 125 as a result of an earthquake that struck Hela Province, adjoining Enga, in 2018.

PNG’s tumultuous geology has long been the source of devastation and death for its people. At the same time, it has brought the promise of fabulous wealth from the copper, gold and hydrocarbons that have accompanied the instability – so much so that the country is sometimes described as “a mountain of gold floating in a sea of oil”. 
PNG’s export economy is driven by mining. But along with the economic benefits, mining has at times brought unplanned and unwelcome impacts. 
PNG’s second-largest gold mine (and one of the top ten in the world) is located at Porgera, only 30 kilometres from the landslide. The mine has recently reopened following four years of disputes and litigation. Porgera’s troubled past embodies much of the problematic nature of mining, especially in a nation that Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade considers “one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world”.
The region’s geology has also been a boon to its people. With so much rich volcanic soil in its well-watered valleys, PNG’s Highlands are considered to be one of the first sites in the world where plants were domesticated, around 7,000 years ago. 
This environment has long supported large populations. When the first outsiders ventured in, as recently as the 1920s and ’30s, they wondered at the signs of prosperity, of settled communities previously unknown.
But, at times, over-population brought violence as groups competed for access to land. Increasingly, this fighting has come to characterise the Highlands generally, and more particularly Enga Province. Accounts of tribal fighting have accompanied reports of the recovery efforts, compounding the challenges facing relief agencies at the landslide site.
While fears of being caught in a tribal fight are real and understandable, a more pressing reason preventing relief reaching the site is the near impossibility of transporting necessary equipment and supplies. What roads there are lie buried under tens of metres of rocks and mud. Helicopters remain the only way of moving, and these can only operate when the low cloud cover allows.
The Enga landslide seems likely to rank among PNG’s worst natural disasters. However, a comparison to the devastation caused by the 1951 eruption of Mt Lamington – with a similar death toll – reveals much about the changing nature of Australia’s relations with Papua New Guinea. 
The Mt Lamington eruption is by far the most costly in terms of lives lost ever to have taken place on what was at the time Australian territory – a fact most Australians would now not know. What may be even more surprising is that the 3,000 Papuans who died were all Australian citizens, following the passing of the Citizenship Act of 1948. 

In Australia, newspapers from the large metropolitan dailies to the smaller regional papers led with stories of the disaster and its aftermath. The devastation entered our historical consciousness, as the collection of photographs in the National Library of Australia, taken by the first medical team to arrive, starkly demonstrates.
Is Australia doing enough?
Seven decades later, we are faced with a similar level of catastrophe. Now, however, the principal responsibility for bringing relief to the victims belongs to PNG’s national government. 
This is entirely appropriate, because PNG has been an independent nation for nearly 50 years. But as Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared in response to the disaster, “At this most tragic of times, I want the people of PNG to know Australia is there for them and always will be.” 
Initial efforts to deliver rescue and recovery services have begun, with the promise of a substantially larger commitment.

Despite the two countries taking separate paths since PNG’s independence, Albanese recognises we share a deep history and a common bond expressed in both good and bad times. This may come as a surprise to many Australians for whom Papua New Guinea perhaps means little beyond the single word “Kokoda” – and not even that, for many. 
How Australians have come to leave PNG out of our understanding of our history is a subject that is tackled in a just-published special issue of Australian Historical Studies, which we co-edited along with Deakin University Associate Professor Helen Gardner.
Many Australians were touched when, in the aftermath of the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, Papua New Guineans took it on themselves to send assistance to affected communities. Now it is our turn. The challenge of getting services to the people of Enga needs more than responses from the PNG and Australian governments: where is the concern, the outrage and the determination to help our friends and neighbours?

Catherine McKinnonâs panoramic new novel presents a gritty view of warâs complexities,https://theconversation.com/catherine-mckinnons-panoramic-new-novel-presents-a-gritty-view-of-wars-complexities-228895,3026118,"Fiction, Australian literature, Novels, Book reviews, War literature","
Catherine McKinnon graduated from Flinders University Drama Centre, South Australia, and was a founding member of the Red Shed Theatre Company, where she worked as writer and director. 
After a period in South Australian theatre, she moved to Sydney to complete a Masters in Creative Writing at UTS, where she began her first novel, The Nearly Happy Family (2008). She followed it with Storyland (2017), written while undertaking her PhD.
Her work been nominated for an AWGIE Award, the Jill Blewett Playwright’s Award, and the Indie Awards. Storyland was shortlisted for the Miles Franklin Literary Award, the Barbara Jefferis Award and the Voss Literary Prize.

Review: To Sing of War – Catherine McKinnon (HarperCollins)

McKinnon’s latest book To Sing of War is a panoramic novel, which takes in multiple settings and characters in the mode of David Mitchell’s celebrated Cloud Atlas (2004). Like Storyland, it is a network of stories, with subtle overlaps.
Storyland was marketed as a book for readers of Kate Grenville, Tim Winton and Robbie Arnott, on the strength of its historical content and its compelling engagement with place and ecology. To Sing of War may prove to have even wider appeal due to its focus on World War II, including the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb, led by the infamous Robert Oppenheimer.

Deeply influenced by Virgil’s epic poem the Aeneid, which begins with the phrase “Arma virumque cano” – “I sing of arms and the man” – McKinnon’s novel resists the glorification of war and the usual narrative of “us against them”, while respecting the unfortunate individuals who are either killed or suffer through the carnage. While it is concerned with the lives of soldiers, To Sing of War also consciously elevates the stories of women, children, queer folk and First Nations people caught in the crossfire. 
The central story, set in Papua New Guinea, feels intimately imagined, probably because it is based, in part, on stories McKinnon inherited from her parents. She recognises that the locals were brutalised and manipulated by both Japanese and Australian soldiers, but there were also genuine bonds. When she visited Papua New Guinea to research her novel, villagers told her war stories that “folded into each other, forming a web of narratives that relate to the end of the war, to the dropping of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki”.
Virgil Nicholson, the novel’s central character, is an Australian soldier fighting in the jungles of Papua New Guinea. He says “there’s never any rest in the jungle”. Yet there is a great deal of waiting. He survives ambushes and near misses, and witnesses the heartbreaking deaths of local children.
His close companion is Taiko, a Papuan boy named by the Japanese, who acts as a guide and saviour, especially when Virgil is delirious with malaria and must be transported back to Aitape for treatment. Taiko has a precocious talent for languages and reading, identifying himself with Ascanius, the son of Aeneas, who also had to “grow up quick”.
McKinnon evidently tries not to insert modern values into the conversations between characters. She allows them to speak their minds, whether they are exploding or perpetuating myths. 
Virgil’s fellow soldier Bones is an Aboriginal man who quietly resents the ignorance of his non-Indigenous mates. In a heated conversation with fellow soldier Smithy, who thinks that blackfellas are all the same, he says: “Land isn’t for taking … It’s not a thing you take and pass around. Nothing to fight over.” Smithy doesn’t understand, so Bones tells him to forget it, because it “won’t make sense” with his radically different worldview.
Ness is a nurse stationed in Papua New Guinea. Originally from Aotearoa New Zealand, with a Moriori and Hungarian circus background, she practises knife-throwing for self-defence with Lotte Wyld, Virgil’s love interest. Ness tells a patient that “the Māori used to eat us for breakfast”, a reference to the killing and enslavement of Moriori by displaced Taranaki Māori in 1835, which generated a myth of widespread cannibalism that many Pākehā – a Maori term for white New Zealanders – have cited to justify colonisation.    
The Māori-Moriori conflict on the Chatham islands also features in David Mitchell’s novel, suggesting an explicit link between the two texts. 

Charlie the bastard
Bones and Virgil lug their platoon’s big gun, called “Charlie the bastard”, through the jungle – pointlessly as it turns out. McKinnon describes the smells, noises and ravishing beauty of the jungle as the soldiers doggedly haul this weapon across rough terrain, suggesting the haphazardness of this theatre of operations. Knowing the effort Bones expends to stay alive – and save others – it is chastening to think that he will not be rewarded for his service in the same way as Virgil upon their return.
The character of Tubby, who declares “Nothing can hurt me now” after taking communion, then suddenly gets shot by the Japanese, is based on a story told during a series of late night phone calls between McKinnon and her father. Shortly before a battle near the village of Dagmug, there had been a religious service, which McKinnon’s father had attended, despite having mixed feelings about religion. The platoon sergeant hugged him after the service, and was killed shortly afterwards. 
There are skirmishes and sacrifices throughout To Sing of War, which emotionally wrench and visibly age the people who survive. When Lotte reunites with Virgil, after a series of letters, she notes that his eyes are darker and hollowed “as if plummeting from the surface of his face; his body taut, brown, but lean, oh so lean”. 
War writing can sometimes be formulaic and clichéd, but McKinnon seeks a grittier view of war’s complexities. To Sing of War recognises the prevalence of sexual violence in wartime – something which is often overlooked in commemorations. 
In the medical team in which Lotte works, there is an unknown rapist and a doctor who steals morphine from their dwindling supplies to self-medicate. Lotte nurses two Papuans, May and Lily, who were taken by the Japanese as comfort women, observing their incremental daily recovery despite the rejection of their community. Their return home must be carefully negotiated with a Swedish priest.
K.B. and Maude, a same-sex couple, are painfully separated by their respective war jobs. Lotte survives a rape attempt and teaches herself to use the knife she was attacked with. “Some people think women aren’t fit for war but they’re wrong,” Lotte reflects: “there are wars nobody knows you’re fighting. Women have been fighting those wars since ancient times.”

The air is foul
The Los Alamos sections of To Sing of War centre around the Trinity tests, which have come back into focus since the release of Christopher Nolan’s controversial film Oppenheimer. 
The main figures in these sections are Oppenheimer’s troubled wife Kitty, whose passion for botany is suppressed by her entrapment in the domestic sphere, and Miriam “Mim” Carver, a scientist and amateur spy, who is torn between her friend Fred Johnson and a beautiful sex worker named Li. 
Mim wrestles with a strong desire to inform the Russians about the “gadget” to keep the arms race balanced. While helping with the bomb’s development, she also chooses to reveal some of its secrets. In this high-stakes atmosphere, she doesn’t know who she can trust. The reader is shown the anarchic social life of Los Alamos, where a captive crowd awaits the finale of this risky top-secret project: “Trap this many people on one small square of land, Mim thinks, and there’s bound to be a compression of energy that needs to go somewhere.”
Following a dream in which a woman comments that “the air is foul”, Oppenheimer sees the death toll in a newspaper headline – “280,000 Casualties in Two Attacks” – and recognises that he will never recover from this fact: he will wear it forever. 
To Sing of War boldly represents Japanese stories of loss, in a welcome counterbalance to Nolan’s film. The characters feel slightly distant, but are rendered with respect. McKinnon makes the notable choice to “disappear” the victims, rather than depict the horrific mangling of characters the reader has only just begun to know. 
Fine threads link the stories. A three legged cat who comforts the distressed May is named Trinity, like the “gadget”. Antonio Bendetti, a Los Alamos scientist, is sent to fight in Papua New Guinea as punishment for his “happy socialist” sympathies. Kenzo, a prisoner of war, is the father of small children back in Japan. In one scene, he attempts to shoot Virgil, only for the bullet to be miraculously deflected by a stone bird Virgil was given by Lotte. 
In Nagasaki, Kenzo’s wife Hiroko is preoccupied with keeping daily life going without him, caring for her two children and finding enough food to survive. She contemplates a haiku about an egret and thinks that the day is “like a new page, anything is possible, and always the sun will rise, and this the egret knows”. Hiroko is reflecting on the different natures of her children when her thought stops abruptly, indicated by a dash –

It is now, in the middle of this thought, that a light, brighter than the sun, shatters the sky, and in that moment, for as far as the eye can see, all life vanishes. 

Kenzo’s grandmother is left to tell of their non-existence: “how will she tell him that those child smiles have gone?”
The omniscient narration allows deep immersion in the minds of multiple characters (though not all). At times, McKinnon has her characters engage in theatrical soliloquies, full of questioning. Lotte says to herself: 

How can a person maintain any level of sanity surrounded by so much violence? What will it be like after the war? Will they ever be able to forget?

The futility and arbitrariness of war hits the characters who stay alive, especially the soldiers in Papua New Guinea, who are at war one day and emerging from the jungle alongside their former enemies the next. The Māori version of the song “Now is the hour” brings the exhausted troops together as the ship pulls out of the harbour heading for home. This is all that remains of their war effort. “What bravado there was has ebbed, and all that remains is song”.

Profession or trade? Why training NZâs teachers in the classroom is not the right answer,https://theconversation.com/profession-or-trade-why-training-nzs-teachers-in-the-classroom-is-not-the-right-answer-230862,3026117,"New Zealand, Universities, Education, Teacher education, Teacher training, Classroom, Apprenticeship, NZ Budget 2024","
How New Zealand trains teachers is about to change with the government’s push to increase the workforce by 1,500. The plan, announced ahead of the 2024 budget, includes funding 1,200 places for aspiring teachers to be trained in the classroom, rather than in universities as they currently are.
While there will still be funding for university places, the policy appears to prioritise school-based training. Trainee teachers will be based primarily in schools, with coursework on top of their daily teaching responsibilities. 
It is a significant shift away from the dominant training model whereby student teachers undertake tertiary level courses alongside periods of teaching experience in schools. 
By training teachers on site, the government hopes to improve classroom preparedness. It follows similar moves in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.





And to be fair, while a lot of the policy detail is unknown, additional funding of teacher education will almost certainly increase the number of places where prospective teachers can train. 
However, moving away from university-based teacher education has the potential to undermine the profession by disconnecting teachers from education research. 

A profession, not a trade
New Zealand’s standalone education colleges merged with universities during the 1990s and early 2000s. In part, the change sought to strengthen teachers’ capacity to critically engage with complex teaching practices and evolving education research. 
Like medicine, law, engineering and architecture, teaching is now considered a profession. This means it has its own distinct body of knowledge, a code of ethics, and an independent governing and registering body.  
Becoming a member of any profession involves a breadth and complexity of professional learning typically housed within a university. Teachers must learn to engage with research, develop critical thinking, and recognise how their actions – and the actions of others – affect learning. 
Indeed, the legally required core characteristics of universities in New Zealand include research, teaching, and their role as “critic and conscience of society”. These characteristics mean universities can provide an ideal setting for the kind of professional training teachers need. 
University-based teacher education still involves a substantial amount of time on school-based placements. This is where student teachers develop practical skills to complement their wider understanding of education, research and professional knowledge.
Research has also found time away from the classroom allows student teachers the space to engage in more abstract levels of critical thinking and personal development. 

Devaluing university-based teacher education
Shifting towards school-based training models signals a belief that the knowledge that matters for teacher education is to be found largely or exclusively within schools themselves. 
This apprenticeship approach requires student teachers to sit “at the side of the master” – learning primarily by observation and copying what they see. 
Apprenticeship learning is an excellent way to approach adult education in many skills and trades. However, in a profession such as teaching it falls short. It adopts a “what works” approach without stopping to interrogate who it’s working for and why. 
An apprenticeship model can also only ever replicate current practice. Given the concern over educational outcomes in New Zealand, there needs to be real change – not more of the same. 
Apprenticeship models typically focus on strategies, curriculum delivery and managing student behaviour. Education research will become less accessible to those in the teaching profession, making it harder to implement any significant change.
Furthermore, apprenticeship models risk narrowing the teacher education curriculum by focusing on current practices and trends. Rather than being adopted outright, new teaching practices and trends need to be critiqued and examined within their historical, social, cultural and research contexts. 
The challenge ahead
Professionals recognise knowledge will continue to move over time. The best thing we can do is equip new teachers with adaptive expertise — the ability to think flexibly, to adapt to varied contexts, and to gain new understanding. 
Universities must have a central place in New Zealand’s teacher education if the profession is to be as strong as is needed.
The country needs teacher training to cultivate a worldview comfortable with complexity and with asking questions, seeking feedback, and gaining new understanding on unfamiliar topics. 
The government needs to support the continual improvement of teacher training in all its forms, including within universities. The education of future generations depends on it.

Wondering how to teach your kids about consent? Hereâs an age-based guide to get you started,https://theconversation.com/wondering-how-to-teach-your-kids-about-consent-heres-an-age-based-guide-to-get-you-started-230976,3026116,"Sex, Parenting, Sex education, Health, Consent, Consumer health","
The Australian government’s new campaign Consent Can’t Wait challenges us all to improve our understanding of consent. It asks a series of questions to illustrate this issue is more complex than simplistic “no means no” messaging. 
The campaign invites viewers to consider the nuances of consent, so we can raise these important issues with children and young people in our lives. 

But what is a good age to start talking about consent? How do parents tackle such conversations when this information probably wasn’t readily discussed in our own upbringing? 
How it starts – early childhood (0–5 years)
Small on-going conversations about consent that start early are best. At this age, children are becoming aware of their bodies, and this is a great time to start basic conversations around consent, body safety and boundaries. 





If you’re tickling or rough-housing with your child and they ask you to stop, respect this. Similarly, you want your child to learn that they should listen to and respect the feelings of others.

We should also not force a child to give a hug or a kiss to a family member if they don’t feel comfortable. Teaching them to be polite and respectful without having to cross their own personal boundaries is key. 
Bath time can also be a great setting to discuss how children’s bodies are their own and the basics of boundaries and privacy.
Childhood and primary school (6–11 years)
As children enter school, their social networks start to expand and the potential for conflict is inevitable. As parents, we can help them to navigate this time and unpack more developed ideas around consent. 
The focus at this stage should be to ensure young people have the necessary skills to form healthy friendships and to engage respectfully with others. You may also want your child to recognise the diversity and difference that exists in our society.
It’s important your child starts to learn about verbal and non-verbal communication. Body language can provide great insight into how another person might be feeling, and children can learn how to tune in and respect others as much as possible. 

As your child starts to form a stronger personal identity, help them identify and maintain their own personal boundaries. Demonstrating how to respond if someone is behaving or touching them in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable helps develop skills to communicate boundaries.
Finally, remember that young people begin to connect in online spaces too. Encourage your child to think critically about what they see online and who they talk to. Teaching children to engage respectively can assist with consensual experiences online too.  
Adolescence and secondary school (12–18 years)
As we transition through the adolescent years, those foundations skills that first applied to relationships with friends and family, extend to romantic relationships, where consent is important for respectful, safe and healthy experiences.
If they haven’t already grasped the notion, it’s important for adolescents to understand that consent can be withdrawn. People have the right to change their mind at any time, even if it might be an activity they had previously agreed to.

Navigating sexual consent can be more complex than seeking and giving permission. Consent must be voluntary and freely given, without coercion or pressure. Just because we are in a romantic relationship with someone, this does not mean we should be expected to engage in particular behaviours if they cross our boundaries.
Adolescents also need to understand that rejection is inevitable. Sometimes people won’t want to go on a date with us, to give us a kiss, or to engage in a particular sexual act and that’s OK. Encourage young people to not take rejection personally, respect the wishes and boundaries of others, and be vigilant to verbal and non-verbal cues.
Adolescents will also start to communicate regularly with peers online and may engage in sexting: sending intimate images to one another. Teach them to express and practise consent to be safe online and be mutually respectful of each other.  

Being accessible and inclusive
Consent can be complex, particularly for minority populations. 
Yarning Quiet Ways is a resource designed for First Nations families.
The Sexuality Education Counselling and Consultancy Agency (SECCA) offers resources suitable for helping to navigate discussions with people with disability or people who require resources written in simple English. 
The Rainbow Project has resources about consent for LGBTQI+ people.  
Final tips for families
Start the conversations early focusing on basic ethics, rights and bodily autonomy. Consent conversations can build in an age-appropriate way and extend to discussions about sexual relationships as children age. 
While discussions should be age-appropriate where possible, it may be relevant to introduce certain topics earlier if need be too.
Communication about consent is best when it’s direct, free from judgement and maintains an open-dialogue. These discussions might feel awkward or uncomfortable but they are important. Homes are critical places for these discussions and it is important that your child sees you as an approachable and askable parent.
Education around consent won’t stop sexual violence on it’s own, so it’s important to have these discussions alongside other areas of importance. 
Discussions around challenging gender stereotypes, modelling respect and how to intervene, the importance of empathy, as well as online safety such as sexting and pornography can assist.

The voice in your head may help you recall and process words. But what if you donât have one?,https://theconversation.com/the-voice-in-your-head-may-help-you-recall-and-process-words-but-what-if-you-dont-have-one-230973,3025995,"Neuroscience, Senses, proprioception, Sensory perception, Aphantasia, Auditory processing, Thoughts","
Can you imagine hearing yourself speak? A voice inside your head – perhaps reciting a shopping list or a phone number? What would life be like if you couldn’t?
Some people, including me, cannot have imagined visual experiences. We cannot close our eyes and conjure an experience of seeing a loved one’s face, or imagine our lounge room layout – to consider if a new piece of furniture might fit in it. This is called “aphantasia”, from a Greek phrase where the “a” means without, and “phantasia” refers to an image. Colloquially, people like myself are often referred to as having a “blind mind”.
While most attention has been given to the inability to have imagined visual sensations, aphantasics can lack other imagined experiences. We might be unable to experience imagined tastes or smells. Some people cannot imagine hearing themselves speak.
A recent study has advanced our understanding of people who cannot imagine hearing their own internal monologue. Importantly, the authors have identified some tasks that such people are more likely to find challenging.





What the study found
Researchers at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States recruited 93 volunteers. They included 46 adults who reported low levels of inner speech and 47 who reported high levels. 
Both groups were given challenging tasks: judging if the names of objects they had seen would rhyme and recalling words. The group without an inner monologue performed worse. But differences disappeared when everyone could say words aloud. 
Importantly, people who reported less inner speech were not worse at all tasks. They could recall similar numbers of words when the words had a different appearance to one another. This negates any suggestion that aphants (people with aphantasia) simply weren’t trying or were less capable.

A welcome validation
The study provides some welcome evidence for the lived experiences of some aphants, who are still often told their experiences are not different, but rather that they cannot describe their imagined experiences. Some people feel anxiety when they realise other people can have imagined experiences that they cannot. These feelings may be deepened when others assert they are merely confused or inarticulate. 
In my own aphantasia research I have often quizzed crowds of people on their capacity to have imagined experiences. 
Questions about the capacity to have imagined visual or audio sensations tend to be excitedly endorsed by a vast majority, but questions about imagined experiences of taste or smell seem to cause more confusion. Some people are adamant they can do this, including a colleague who says he can imagine what combinations of ingredients will taste like when cooked together. But other responses suggest subtypes of aphantasia may prove to be more common than we realise.
The authors of the recent study suggest the inability to imagine hearing yourself speak should be referred to as “anendophasia”, meaning without inner speech. Other authors had suggested anauralia (meaning without auditory imagery). Still other researchers have referred to all types of imagined sensation as being different types of “imagery”.
Having consistent names is important. It can help scientists “talk” to one another to compare findings. If different authors use different names, important evidence can be missed.

We have more than 5 senses
Debate continues about how many senses humans have, but some scientists reasonably argue for a number greater than 20. 
In addition to the five senses of sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing, lesser known senses include thermoception (our sense of heat) and proprioception (awareness of the positions of our body parts). Thanks to proprioception, most of us can close our eyes and touch the tip of our index finger to our nose. Thanks to our vestibular sense, we typically have a good idea of which way is up and can maintain balance.
It may be tempting to give a new name to each inability to have a given type of imagined sensation. But this could lead to confusion. Another approach would be to adapt phrases that are already widely used. People who are unable to have imagined sensations commonly refer to ourselves as “aphants”. This could be adapted with a prefix, such as “audio aphant”. Time will tell which approach is adopted by most researchers.
Why we should keep investigating
Regardless of the names we use, the study of multiple types of inability to have an imagined sensation is important. These investigations could reveal the essential processes in human brains that bring about a conscious experience of an imagined sensation.
In time, this will not only lead to a better understanding of the diversity of humans, but may help uncover how human brains can create any conscious sensation. This question – how and where our conscious feelings are generated – remains one of the great mysteries of science.

"The coverage of Laura Tingleâs comments on racism is a textbook beat-up, but sheâs not in the wrong",https://theconversation.com/the-coverage-of-laura-tingles-comments-on-racism-is-a-textbook-beat-up-but-shes-not-in-the-wrong-231051,3025994,"Social media, Media, Migration, Journalism, ABC, Australian media, Peter Dutton, Society, impartiality, Political journalism, Journalistic ethics, Antoinette Lattouf","
Striking the balance between journalists’ private free speech rights and the public duty they owe to impartiality and their employer’s reputation is one of the most complex ethical issues confronting the media today.
It is in the spotlight again because of remarks made by Laura Tingle, chief political correspondent for the ABC’s 7.30 program and staff-elected member of the ABC board, at the Sydney Writers’ Festival on the weekend. 
The remarks were made on a politics panel chaired by former ABC political correspondent Barrie Cassidy, and consisting also of three other political journalists: Nikki Savva of The Sydney Morning Herald, Amy Remeikis of Guardian Australia, and Bridget Brennan, ABC presenter and former Indigenous Affairs Editor.
It’s an example of how years of social media ubiquity has created new challenges for journalists as they try to navigate the professional and personal spheres ethically.





What’s all the fuss about?
In the context of a discussion about immigration, during which she referred to a previous remark by Savva, Tingle said:

On the night of Peter Dutton’s address-in-reply to the budget, I was sitting there with this terrible chill running through me thinking, okay, we’re back into this territory. I don’t think […] we’ve had the leader of a major political party saying everything that is going wrong in this country is because of migrants.

She continued:

I had this sudden flash of people turning up to try to rent a property or at an auction, and they look a bit different – whatever you define different as – and he has given a licence for them to be abused where people feel they are missing out. We’re a racist country, let’s face it. We always have been and it’s very depressing and a terrible prospect for the next election.

These comments were reported in The Australian, which quoted Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce attacking the ABC as being “mad left-wing”. It also quoted the opposition spokesman on communications, David Coleman, as saying the comments were “extraordinary and completely indefensible”, and Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price describing Tingle as “blatantly partisan”.
This has all the hallmarks of a beat-up, the initial reporting being spiced with adjectives and adverbs – “extraordinary”, “controversial”, “bizarrely” – and followed up by a story, denied by the ABC, that board members have had “emergency discussions” about her remarks.
Were Tingle’s remarks partisan? Of course. They were statements of her opinions, clearly and obviously so. 
Do they reflect on her impartiality as a journalist? No. They were made informally as part of a panel discussion in which issues of immigration and race were canvassed. She was not doing journalism. Moreover, Tingle was not there representing the ABC or the 7.30 program. She was there because, like all the other members of the panel, she has expertise in federal politics.
The counterargument is that in her person, she is inseparable from her role as 7.30’s chief political correspondent. That is not reasonable. It would be to deny her an existence outside her job. If she had been there as a representative of the ABC or of the program, it would be different, but that was not the position.

She is entitled to the view that Australia is racist, that Dutton’s approach to immigration bodes ill for the quality of debate at the next election, and that his remarks about the connection between immigration and the housing crisis may lead to people seen as different being abused. Plenty of people would disagree with her, but that does not provide a basis for accusing her of professional misconduct.
Whatever the merits of this analysis, however, her comments have handed the ABC’s enemies in the Coalition and News Corporation a stick with which to beat the organisation. 
That does not, of itself, mean she has brought the ABC into disrepute, because the attack is so nakedly political. However, it does highlight not just the tension between a journalist’s free speech rights and their professional duties, but the obligations an employer owes to a journalist under attack.
Journalism in a social media age
There have been three other instances in the past year that illustrate these complexities.
In November 2023, roughly 300 journalists signed an open letter to the news organisations they worked for, the subtext of which was the coverage of the Gaza war was, at that date, pro-Israel. It was not clear exactly under whose auspices the letter was written, but it was clear it had the endorsement of the journalists’ union, the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance.
Here, journalists speaking as journalists, not in their private capacity, were becoming participants in the story. It is categorically different from the Tingle case. The Nine newspapers said their people who signed the letter would be taken off the Gaza story.
Then, in December 2023, the ABC removed a stand-in presenter on Sydney radio, Antoinette Lattouf, for alleged misconduct. In the Fair Work Commission where she is challenging her removal, Lattouf alleges she was unfairly dismissed after reposting on Instagram a Human Rights Watch report on the conflict in Israel and Palestine. The ABC is contesting the case. 
Before she was removed, a pro-Israel lobby group, Lawyers for Israel, had conducted an intense campaign of WhatsApp messages to the ABC seeking to have her removed. 
Social media was at the centre of this. 

For years, media organisations encouraged – even demanded – their journalists “engage” on social media. This has created difficulties about where to draw the line between personal free speech and professional obligations.
Social media has also been weaponised against journalists, not just through trolling but through the application of pressure on their employers. 
Finally, the Tingle case has echoes of the attacks on the former high-profile ABC presenter Stan Grant, particularly by News Corporation, and including a cascade of abuse on social media.
Grant had appeared on an ABC TV panel as part of the coverage of King Charles III’s coronation in May 2023, during which he made remarks concerning the monarchy’s ties to extermination and theft of land.
The failure of the ABC’s senior management to defend him led to his resigning from the ABC three months later. Grant said his trust was broken. 
Separating personal preferences from professional decision-making is a standard ethical expectation in all professions, including journalism. It requires intellectual self-discipline of a kind well-trained professionals are routinely able to exert. It does not require them to be intellectual eunuchs, only that they avoid allowing their personal preferences to taint their professional work.

Vivid Sydneyâs future seems bright if it can balance spectacle with subtlety ,https://theconversation.com/vivid-sydneys-future-seems-bright-if-it-can-balance-spectacle-with-subtlety-but-challenges-abound-226507,3025993,"Design, Vivid, Vivid Sydney, Entertainment, festival, arts festivals, Visual art and design","
It’s the year 2008, and some members of the International Association of Lighting Designers are gathered in a boardroom in North Sydney, myself included. My colleagues Mary-Anne Kyriakou (who would later be Vivid’s inaugural festival director) and Michael Day are sharing a vision of what’s almost unthinkable at the time. 
They paint a picture of a light festival in which the winter of Sydney has become vibrant in colour: buildings are illuminated, streets are alive with creative light installations and the crowds walk about in awe. It is a vision that would soon become Vivid Sydney. 
This year’s program promises to impress once again with a diverse range of content including Julia Gutman’s first ever animation work, Echo, a story of wonder, vulnerability and strength displayed on the shells of the Sydney Opera House. 

Installations such as Stateless and Humanity by Sinclair Park touch on world issues in ways that offer both delight and prompt reflection. 
We also see First Nations artist Tori-Jay Mordey’s work, Faces of Change, on the pylons of Sydney Harbour Bridge. It explores, among other themes, humanity’s connection to nature and the threat that rising sea levels pose to the Torres Strait Islands.

On the lighter side, there’s a Tekno Train you can have a rave on, and some parties held in a 100-year-old heritage substation.
It’s my hope Vivid Sydney will continue to captivate locals and visitors this year, and for the years to come. But while we look forward to these experiences, let’s also look at the challenges to overcome. 

When it all began
The inaugural Smart Light Sydney event was staged in May 2009, laying the foundation for Vivid. The shells of the Sydney Opera House became a canvas for the festival’s first headline projection by Brian Eno. 
Several small and large installations were staged across Circular Quay and the Rocks, with various landmark buildings lit up. A number of light artists and designers participated with passion, somewhat tight budgets, and relatively modest works compared to today’s.

Smart Light Sydney offered glimpses of what could be possible in the future. Support from the government and private sector soon followed, and the stage was set for the future of Vivid. 
Throughout the 2010s, Vivid inspired a number of smaller and regional towns in New South Wales and beyond to experiment with how lighting could become a spectacle and contribute to their own nightscapes. 
In just a few years, Vivid evolved from a modest initiative into a globally recognised celebration of light, music and ideas – positioning itself next to longer-running festivals such as Lyon’s famous Fête des Lumières, Montréal en Lumière and the Berlin Festival of Lights.
A balancing act
The success of such a massive festival will, of course, come with challenges. Vivid, for instance, must grapple with balancing genuine artistic endeavour with the objective of attracting the masses. 
This is a fine and delicate balance. If tipped, Vivid could fall into the trap of prioritising spectacle over substance. Some critics already contend that the festival emphasises grandiosity in a way that overshadows creative pursuit.
In recent years, the public and politicians have also criticised key light installations being ticketed, including this year’s Lightscape in the Botanic Gardens and Dark Spectrum in the Wynyard Tunnels. 

Perhaps ticketing these offerings helps kerb visitor numbers so they can remain enjoyable (albeit for a smaller number of people). Or it may provide the revenue needed for the festival to deliver more innovative and valuable experiences. 
Nonetheless, the decision has sparked debate over the commercialisation of what started as a cultural community event. Numerous corporate-sponsored installations have also now become centrepieces of the festival.

Beyond this is a growing challenge for creatives to build on what has already been done. The installations and projections this year again showcase great examples of what can be achieved through the creative use of light and technology. As the festival matures, however, people’s expectations also grow.

Sustainability and logistical challenges
Environmental impact and sustainability are key considerations when thinking about Vivid’s future. The festival’s website details actions it has taken to deliver on this front, which have included partly offsetting its carbon footprint, using more renewable power, installing taps to reduce plastic landfill, encouraging public transport and going paper-free when possible. 
Nonetheless, environmental issues remain intrinsic to an event of this scale. The festival’s light pollution and reliance on large-scale energy consumption are points of contention, especially as awareness of these issues grows. Among all the environmental challenges the festival faces, using dark-sky friendly lighting is perhaps one of the most tricky.
Another challenge is that the festival’s growth has somewhat strained local infrastructure, leading to overcrowded public spaces and transport systems. During the festival weeks, portaloos, barricades and other temporary infrastructure also decorate the city.
While Vivid puts in a notable effort into remaining accessible and inclusive for all, the sheer number of attendees (supposedly 3.4 million last year) means managing this size comes with many hurdles.

What the future may hold
These challenges aren’t unique to Vivid Sydney. They are faced by many similar events. In each context, there is nuance and also unique opportunities. 
Vivid could play a profound, flagship role in showcasing Australia’s design culture to its own people and to the world. This is a culture characterised by kindness, fairness, diversity, creativity and a commitment to innovation and sustainability. 
Perhaps Vivid’s future doesn’t rely on getting bigger and brighter, but on the finer aspects of its content. From embracing Indigenous wisdom, to connecting to nature, to highlighting world-class architecture and lighting design – Vivid has the potential to reinvent itself year on year.
But it will need to continue to deliver spectacle with subtlety to achieve this, and tell stories that touch people on a deeper level. Perhaps, unconventionally, it makes sense to embrace the darkness as much as the light.

Vanuatu is holding its first-ever referendum â hereâs whatâs at stake,https://theconversation.com/vanuatu-is-holding-its-first-ever-referendum-heres-whats-at-stake-228192,3025992,"Referendum, Pacific, Vanuatu, World news","
Vanuatu’s young people are tired of political instability. And they are not just sitting back as political spectators, they’re actively pushing for reform and are determined to steer their country towards stability and prosperity. 
Their activism is centred around a crucial national referendum being held today, which is aimed at creating a more stable government. If approved, the referendum would lead to important changes meant to reduce the political instability caused by MPs often switching parties. 
Political instability has wracked Vanuatu since it gained independence in 1980, severely affecting its governance and public trust in its institutions. 
In recent years, this turmoil has intensified. In 2023, for example, the country cycled through three different prime ministers in a month due to successful no-confidence votes. 
One of these no-confidence votes in November meant that many important bills, including the 2024 budget, were not able to be passed.

This is what prompted ni-Vanuatu youth to form “Muvmen blong Red” (or Movement Red) last year. The movement is aimed at creating a future in which the government is more responsive to the people and adept at tackling key livability issues, such as improving roads, reducing food prices, offering assistance to young people looking for work, improving health care and helping communities hit by cyclones to rebuild. 
Putting an end to the rampant party-switching among MPs will help toward this goal. Young ni-Vanuatu believe this practice undermines the integrity of the political process and leads to short-lived policies that fail to address the long-term needs of the country. 
For example, during my fieldwork in Vanuatu last year, the country was without a minister for youth and sports for a few months – a direct consequence of these frequent government changes. This significantly hampered the ministry’s work – provincial youth officers told me their funds had been delayed or redirected as a result. 
Furthermore, my conversations with young people from the outer islands revealed a deepening distrust in the government. This was largely due to MPs frequently switching sides in parliament, which many people felt led to a neglect of their needs and interests.

What is the referendum asking?
One major step forward was the approval of the Political Parties Registration Act in December, which was strongly supported in parliament. 
This law requires all political parties to officially register and follow strict financial reporting rules, similar to those of private entities and NGOs, with oversight provided by the Election Commission. These measures are designed to make the government more stable, ensure election results are followed, and  reduce the formation of temporary political parties without clear platforms.
Parliament also passed a separate act that would amend the constitution with two new articles aimed at ensuring politicians stay true to their duties. 
Article 17A would require that MPs who are elected as part of a political party to stay with that party for their entire time in office. If they leave the party or are kicked out, they will lose their seat in parliament. 
Article 17B applies to independent candidates and members of single-member parties. After an election, they must join a larger political party and support that party during their term. If they don’t, they will also lose their seat. 
For these amendments to come into effect, they now need to be approved through a national referendum. More than 200,000 registered voters are able to take part in Vanuatu and overseas. It’s the first referendum of its kind to be held in the country.
Opposition MP Ishmael Kalsakau, who had been ousted as prime minister last year, argued for the referendum to be delayed, saying it was more important to look at the root cause of political instability before amending the Constitution.

What this moment means
As Vanuatu has been gearing up for this monumental event, there’s been a real buzz among the youth and wider community. 
The “Movmen blong Red” group has been very active in the campaign, using social media, public meetings and peaceful protests to educate the public on the importance of the referendum. They have also been working with national leaders, which marks a significant move towards a more inclusive government. 
The referendum isn’t just about changing laws – it’s about young people, in particular, stepping up to shape their nation’s path forward. They’re not just hoping for better governance, they’re actively participating in creating it. 
This is a pivotal moment for Vanuatu, showing just how powerful a united, informed public can be in steering their country towards a more stable future.

Pronatalism is the latest Silicon Valley trend. What is it âÂ and why is it disturbing?,https://theconversation.com/pronatalism-is-the-latest-silicon-valley-trend-what-is-it-and-why-is-it-disturbing-231059,3025952,"Population, Explainer, Rationalism, Silicon Valley, Birth rate, Elon Musk, Effective altruism, Longtermism","
For Malcolm and Simone Collins, declining birth rates across many developed countries are an existential threat. The solution is to have “tons of kids,” and to use a hyperrational, data-driven approach to guide everything from genetic selection to baby names and day-to-day parenting.
They don’t heat their Pennsylvania home in winter, because heating is a “pointless indulgence”. Their children wear iPads around their necks. And a Guardian journalist witnessed Malcolm strike their two-year-old across the face for misbehaviour, a parenting style they apparently developed based on watching “tigers in the wild”.
The Collinses are leading spokespeople for a movement called pronatalism, popular in Silicon Valley. Elon Musk, a father of 11, is one of its leading proponents. “Population collapse due to low birth rates is a much bigger risk to civilization than global warming,” Musk tweeted. 
Demographers disagree: there is no collapse, and one is not even predicted. Such evidence has not stopped the rise of pronatalism in response to an imagined “population bomb.” 
Pronatalism has strong links to effective altruism, a movement tied to Silicon Valley and elite schools, which uses “evidence and reason to figure out how to benefit as many people as possible”, and longtermism, which insists our long-term future is the key moral priority.

What is pronatalism?
A general definition of pronatalism is “any attitude or policy that is ‘pro-birth’, that encourages reproduction, that exalts the role of parenthood”. 
For pronatalists, having many children is not an individual choice, but a societal imperative: higher birth rates are necessary to maintain population levels, support economic growth, and preserve cultural and national identities.
Pronatalism is not new. Anxieties around a declining citizenry are longstanding and states have not been afraid to intervene. 
For instance, after World War I, women in France were only averaging three children, while their German “rivals” were averaging five. Pronatalist organisations sprang up and lobbying groups were formed. Laws were passed prohibiting contraceptives and abortion, though these failed to alter the trend.
On the surface, pronatalism is driven by “rational” concerns. Many developed countries have fertility rates below the replacement level of 2.1 children.  The inevitable result is an ageing population. The fear is economic: with fewer working-age people, there will be no one to support the elderly and maintain economic productivity, straining state resources and social welfare systems.
Pronatalism’s rational allure also stems from its reasonable recommendations. Financial incentives like direct payments and tax breaks are recommended for families with multiple children. Generous parental leave policies and affordable childcare are suggested to make the work/life balance work. And affordable housing and subsidised education can take the sting out of child-rearing costs. 
These are not radical policies – indeed many countries struggling to increase birth rates, such as Hungary, Sweden and Singapore, have already implemented various forms of them.
All of this assumes growth is not only good, but urgent. However, scholars have questioned this powerful but unexamined assumption. In Decline and Prosper!, population economist Vegard Skirbekk assembles a wealth of material to demonstrate that declining births do not mean the death of society, but may actually be a boon.
In fact, the population is only decreasing in some places: across Africa, it is increasing. In Niger, Chad, Somalia and many other countries, total fertility rates range from 4 to above 6. 

Pronatalism, ethnicity and engineering
This brings us to a second and more disturbing definition of pronatalism: “a political, ideological, or religious project to encourage childbearing by some or all members of a civil, ethnic, or national group”.
In short, the problem for pronatalism is not declining reproduction, but who is reproducing. Pronatalism is inextricably tied to nationalism alongside race, class and ethnicity. In Britain, for instance, the media have doggedly begged or threatened women into having more children for the sake of the nation: “close your eyes and think of England.”
Such a framing can quickly become xenophobic. Births “inside” the nation are inevitably contrasted with immigration from the “outside”. This is fertile ground for theories such as the “great replacement” to take root. 
Immigration is a “misnomer”, writes one popular proponent of the theory, “it is more akin to an invasion, a migratory tsunami, a submerging wave of ethnic substitution”. In this zero-sum world, if “we” are not actively maintaining our numbers, our cities, cultures and livelihoods will swiftly be taken over by “them”.
Here, nationalism tips into ethnonationalism and reproductive debates descend into violent racism. “It’s the birthrates, it’s the birthrates, it’s the birthrates,” repeated the Christchurch shooter in his manifesto, a connection discussed in my book about digital hate. 
It’s no surprise, then, when we see white supremacists attending pronatalist events. The movement resonates with the infamous 14 words of white supremacy: “We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.”
These more insidious aspects shed light on the pronatalism exemplified by the Collinses. Firstly, this vision appears to be about reproducing a certain kind of person. The Collinses screen for disability and optimise for intelligence. 
The logic here is that DNA is all-important. It doesn’t matter that their childrens’ rooms aren’t heated, or they wear iPads around their necks, or that their two-year-old is struck across the face for misbehaviour, because, in the end, nature wins over nurture. 
Secondly, in the pronatalist vision, the children themselves seem to be beside the point. The child is less an individual, with desires and dignity, than a vehicle for a political project, a dense bundle of futurity. 
Here we see the strong connections between pronatalism and effective altruism, Both are obsessed with abstract anxieties about “trillions of people to come” in the long-term future. In this numbers game, the child is demoted to a data point. As pronatalism rises, grasping these unspoken logics becomes key.

Why did primates evolve such big brains? First study of its kind says it wasnât for finding food,https://theconversation.com/why-did-primates-evolve-such-big-brains-first-study-of-its-kind-says-it-wasnt-for-finding-food-228892,3025871,"Evolution, Primates, Brain, Animals, Monkeys, Panama, Animal studies, Brain evolution, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Thanks to our large brains, humans and non-human primates are smarter than most mammals. But why do some species develop large brains in the first place? 
The leading hypothesis for how primates evolved large brains involves a feedback loop: smarter animals use their intelligence to find food more efficiently, resulting in more calories, which provides the energy to power a large brain. Support for this idea comes from studies that have found a correlation between brain size and diet – more specifically, the amount of fruit in an animal’s diet.
Fruit is a high-power food, but creates a complicated puzzle for animals. Different fruit species ripen at different times of the year and are spread throughout an animal’s home range. Animals that need to find such highly variable food might be more likely to evolve large brains. 
A key assumption here is that species with larger brains are more intelligent and therefore can find food more efficiently. In a new study published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, we directly tested this hypothesis of brain evolution for the first time.





Tracking fruit eaters in Panama
A major problem for testing the fruit-diet hypothesis is that measuring foraging efficiency is difficult. The mammals we study travel long distances, usually more than three kilometres per day, making it difficult to replicate realistic study conditions in a lab.
Some researchers have experimentally manipulated food distribution in wild animals, but the animals needed extensive training to learn to visit human-made food resources.

In our study, we took advantage of a natural phenomenon in Panama that occurs when the normally complex fruit puzzle shrinks to just a few species of ripe fruit over a three-month period. During this time, all fruit-eating mammals are forced to focus on one tree species: Dipteryx oleifera.
Fortunately for us, Dipteryx trees are huge, sometimes reaching 40–50 metres high, and produce bright purple flowers in summer. We mapped the island with drones during the flowering season and identified patches of purple flowers, mapping virtually every Dipteryx that produced fruit a few months later.

This gave us the full extent of the fruit puzzle our study animals faced, but we still needed to test how efficiently animals with different brain sizes visited these trees. We chose two large-brained primates (spider monkeys and white-faced capuchins) and two smaller-brained raccoon relatives (white-nosed coatis and kinkajous).
Over two fruiting seasons, we collected movement data from more than 40 individual animals, resulting in more than 600,000 GPS locations. 

We then had to figure out when animals visited Dipteryx trees and for how long. This was a complex task, because to know exactly when our animals entered and exited the fruit trees, we had to extrapolate their location between the GPS fixes taken every four minutes. Some animals also had the bad habit of sleeping in Dipteryx trees. Thankfully, our collars recorded animal activity, so we could tell when they were sleeping.
Once these challenges were solved, we calculated route efficiency as the daily amount of time spent active in Dipteryx trees, divided by the distance travelled.

Do smarter foragers forage smarter?
If larger-brained animals use their intelligence to more efficiently visit fruit trees, we would expect the big-brained primates in our study to have more efficient foraging routes.
That’s not what we found.
The two monkey species didn’t have more efficient routes than the two non-primates, which puts a serious dent in the fruit-diet hypothesis of brain evolution. If smarter species were more efficient, they might be able to satisfy their nutritional needs more quickly, then spend the rest of the day relaxing.
If this was the case, we would have expected the monkeys to route themselves more efficiently in the first few hours of the day after waking up hungry. When looking at these first 2–4 hours of the day, we found the same result: monkeys were not more efficient than non-primates.   

Why the big brains, then?
So, if the evolution of these large brains doesn’t allow primates to plan more efficient foraging routes, why did brain size increase in some species?
Perhaps it has to do with memory. If species with larger brains have better episodic memory, they might be able to optimise the timing of fruit tree visits to get more food. Preliminary analyses of our dataset didn’t support this explanation, but we’ll need more detailed studies to test this hypothesis.
Intelligence might be linked to tool use, which could help an animal extract more nutrients from their environment. Of our four study species, the white-faced capuchin monkey is the only one that’s been observed using tools, and it also has the largest brain (relative to body size).
Our study could also lend support to the hypothesis that brain size increased to handle the complexities of living in a social group.
Large brains have evolved in an assortment of vertebrates (dolphins, parrots, crows) and invertebrates (octopuses). While our study can’t determine the exact drivers of brain evolution in all of these species, we have directly tested a key assumption on wild tropical mammals in a relatively non-invasive manner.
We’ve demonstrated that by using the latest sensor technologies we can test big hypotheses about the evolution, psychology and behaviour of animals in their natural environment.

NZ Budget 2024: tax cuts and borrowing donât always fuel inflation â but Nicola Willis has to get the balance right,https://theconversation.com/nz-budget-2024-tax-cuts-and-borrowing-dont-always-fuel-inflation-but-nicola-willis-has-to-get-the-balance-right-229715,3025812,"Budget, New Zealand, Monetary policy, Inflation, Fiscal policy, Government debt, NZ politics, tax cuts, NZ Budget 2024","
On the eve of the first budget from the National-ACT-New Zealand First coalition government, there is ongoing debate over whether borrowing while offering tax cuts could trigger a rise in inflation. 
Finance minister Nicola Willis has confirmed the budget will introduce “meaningful but modest” tax relief. But what impact will these cuts have on New Zealand’s economy?
During the election campaign, National promised up to $250 fortnightly in tax cuts for families with children, and up to $100 for childless households. Similarly, ACT pledged approximately $100 monthly to the average New Zealander. NZ First did not promise any tax cuts.
But definitive figures have been vague. This uncertainty has triggered heated debate. During the first leader’s debate last year, former prime minister Chris Hipkins argued “National’s tax cuts would exacerbate inflation”.





Echoing these concerns, the OECD’s biennial report on the New Zealand economy emphasised the necessity for tax cuts to be fully funded, whether through spending reductions or boosted revenue streams. 
The OECD also cautioned against new debt creation, arguing the New Zealand government should first focus on bolstering debt sustainability and curbing inflation.

The core critique coming from those opposed to the government’s tax cuts is that debt-financed tax cuts tend to fuel inflation. So, what does economic research – and recent history – reveal about the ramifications of debt-financed tax cuts? Turns out, quite a bit. 
Debt and inflation
The fiscal theory of the price level) argues inflation is determined by government debt, and present and future tax and spending plans, and not monetary policy. So, debt per se is not inherently inflationary. 
Instead, inflationary risks arise when there is no clearly defined and credible policy on how fiscal surpluses will be reinstated in the future.
Even if spending programmes or tax cuts rely entirely on debt financing, they would not necessarily cause inflation – provided there is a credible commitment and pathway to restoring surpluses in the future.
In contrast, spending by the preceding Labour government – some of which was an appropriate response to the pandemic – significantly contributed to the persistent inflation we are now witnessing. This is largely due to the absence of a clear strategy for restoring fiscal surpluses.
Labour’s NZ$1 billion debt-financed spend on cost-of-living payments, for example, was almost certainly inflationary. It violated the basic economic principles of adjusting fiscal and monetary policy as needed to control abrupt changes in demand or supply (also known as business cycle stabilisation).
Similar tax rebate programmes in the United States in 2001 and 2008 led to demand surges of up to 2.3% in the quarter of their introduction. 
This heightened demand occurred within an already overheating economy with substantial supply shortages, and no credible plan was introduced to restore fiscal balance. This combination inevitably fuelled inflationary pressures.
Overall, the impact of income tax changes on inflation depends on the complex relationship between demand and supply side effects, exchange rate effects, and expectations. And there is no clear answer in existing theoretical economic models as to whether income tax changes alone will increase or decrease inflation.
Adding tax cuts to the mix
A recent study using data from the US investigated the effects of tax cuts at the top and the bottom of the income distribution. 
The study found cutting taxes at the bottom had a positive effect on the economy, but cutting at the top did not. Cutting income taxes at the bottom increased consumption, GDP, real wages, employment, hours worked and labour force participation.
These results reveal how income tax cuts can be beneficial for the economy, strongly affecting both the demand and supply sides of the economy. Willis has said National’s tax cuts will be targeted to middle and lower-income workers. 
The most interesting insight from this study is that the effect of tax cuts on prices is insignificant. Price levels do not significantly change when taxes are cut. Furthermore, the largest (yet still insignificant) effect occurs about three years after the tax cut.
Therefore, even if the government’s proposed tax cuts pushed inflation up, it would not occur before 2027-2028, when the Reserve Bank predicts inflation will be back to its target level of around 2%.
Overall, and based on the latest available research, there is no evidence the proposed tax cuts would make inflation worse.

The intersectionality of hate helps us understand the ideology of Donald Trump and the far right,https://theconversation.com/the-intersectionality-of-hate-helps-us-understand-the-ideology-of-donald-trump-and-the-far-right-230268,3025774,"Feminism, Politics, Discrimination, Racism, Homophobia, Immigration, Terrorism, Women, Sexism, Antisemitism, Minorities, Islamophobia, Far right, Donald Trump, Mass shootings, US elections, Intersectionality, Progressive, Ideology, Hate, Trumpism, Anti-feminism, Shootings, Woke, Elections 2024","
A new conceptual tool is required to fully understand the most recent rhetorical strategies of far-right activists and politicians, including former U.S. President Donald Trump. This is precisely what the concept of “intersectionality of hate” aims to do.
Analysts and academics have been talking about the intersectionality of hate for several years now. In doing so, they draw on the notion of intersectionality developed by African-American law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw to designate a reality shaped by sexism, racism, classism and other categories (there are some 30 in all).
Crenshaw points out that African-American women have always been aware of this complex reality. Mary Church Terrell, a Black suffragist, declared around 1920 that “a white woman has only one handicap to overcome, that of sex. I have two: sex and race.”  
While researching anti-feminism and discourses of men’s victimhood related to a so-called crisis of masculinity, I became aware of how the new concept of intersectionality of hate makes it possible to understand the interweaving of hateful discourses. The French historian Christine Bard, with whom I have the good fortune to collaborate, rightly points out that “anti-feminism practises intersectionality, but it’s the intersectionality of hate,” which brings together sexism, racism, antisemitism, xenophobia and homophobia. 





This interweaving of hate speech can also be viewed from different points of view, for example, from the racist and xenophobic or “anti-gender” and transphobic movements.
Conceptual innovation
The popularity of the concept of intersectionality no doubt explains the synchronous appearance of the intersectionality of hate on both sides of the Atlantic.
The article “How Trump Made Hate Intersectional” appeared in New York magazine on November 9, 2016, the day after Trump’s election. It was signed by the African-American intellectual Rembert Browne, who explained how the Republican candidate federated voters. “Trump won the presidency by making hate intersectional. He encouraged sexists to also be racists and homophobes, while saying disgusting things about immigrants in public and Jews online.”
Hatred is mixed here with the fear of being robbed of one’s country, institutions and personal achievements, and with anger at not having what one thinks one is entitled to simply by virtue of being a heterosexual white male. This attitude is reminiscent of that of the “Angry White Men” that was much talked about just a few years ago: it is no longer limited to blaming a single group for real or imagined personal problems but blames all minority groups. That means there is no longer a single scapegoat, but a whole herd. 
At the same time, in France, Bard, who has shown that anti-feminism and lesbophobia are intertwined and mutually reinforcing, analyzed 1,367 articles dealing with women, gender and sexuality published in the far-right weekly Minute. 
She found that “the intersectionality of hate is practised, associating feminism, homosexualism, Islamism and immigrationism.” She notes that political and media figures are targeted with particular intensity if they are women, and also if they are Jewish, Muslim or of African origin. The historian concludes that this intersectionality of hate runs counter to any egalitarian or inclusive perspective.
Attacks on progressives
Shortly afterwards, the journal Atlantis: Critical Studies in Gender, Culture, and Social Justice devoted a short special report to the intersectionality of hate, associating it with the far right, which attacks progressives and accuses them of imposing their values and defending “minorities.” 
In addition to racist and sexist attacks, there are also virulent accusations against “cultural Marxists” (or “wokes”) who allegedly control the State in order to develop “positive discrimination” programs and influence the education system to be able to indoctrinate young people with “political correctness.” 
Each attack is an opportunity to point out that the essence of the United States is European, Anglo-Saxon, Christian, heterosexual, capitalist and meritocratic. The attacks also serve to distract attention from the elite that really dominates the country, which is made up of multi-billionaires in the White House, as well as heads of big business and media.
The intersectionality of hate is disseminated by influential traditional (Fox News) and web (Daily Stormer and Daily Wire) media, think tanks like the National Policy Institute and polemicists like Christopher Rufo and Ben Shapiro. 
Terrorism
The notion of intersectionality of hate is taken up again in the analysis of hate speech and those associated with terrorist attacks. For example, a study in Europe, Intersectional Hate Speech Online, concludes that “Women remain the group of people most often targeted by intersectional hate speech […], for example Muslim women, Roma women or Women of Colour. […] Another target group for intersectional hate speech is women in public positions.” 
Europol also mentions the intersectionality of hate in its 2020 Terrorism Situation and Trend Report. The agency presents a list of attacks motivated by anti-feminism, racism and xenophobia. It gives the example of the one perpetrated in 2011 in Norway by the Nazi Anders Breivik, who claimed in his manifesto to be defending Christian European civilization, and who massacred 76 young socialists. 

Europol also mentions Elliot Rodger, who committed one of the first mass murders associated with involuntary celibates in California in 2014, and who also expressed sexist and racist hatred in his manifesto.
“I was anti-everything,” answered a former French gendarme when the court asked him if he was homophobic, during a trial for having planned attacks on several targets. The defendant had also written a neo-Nazi manifesto celebrating Breivik. 
Other Islamophobic attackers had planned to attack feminists. The one who targeted the Québec mosque in 2017 was interested in feminist groups at Laval University, and the one who decimated a Muslim family in Ontario, in 2021, had scouted abortion clinics.
Finally, British journalist Helen Lewis points out in her article “The Intersectionality of Hate”, published in The Atlantic, on a mass killer who targeted Buffalo’s African-American community in 2022, that his manifesto included antisemitic cartoons.
Victim rhetoric
So, the intersectionality of hate works by superimposing similar analytical frameworks that systematically deduce the same dynamics from reality, and always lead to the same conclusion: the white heterosexual male is a victim of “minorities” he must resist.
This rhetoric helps to legitimize even the most obvious abuses, such as voting for the would-be dictator for a day Trump, or imposing one’s vision of things through terrorist violence.
The intersectionality of hate also targets progressives and reflects the refusal to recognize that the “majority” of white heterosexual men is, in reality, a minority whose claim to superiority, or even supremacy, is well and truly contested in the name of social justice.

Australia is getting a new digital mental health service. Will it help? Hereâs what the evidence says,https://theconversation.com/australia-is-getting-a-new-digital-mental-health-service-will-it-help-heres-what-the-evidence-says-230961,3025630,"Mental health, Health policy, Health, Health budget, Australian budget 2024","
In this year’s budget, the federal government announced one of the biggest changes to the mental health system in nearly two decades: a digital early intervention service to relieve Australians’ early psychological distress before it builds into mental illness.
Starting in 2026, and based on the United Kingdom’s Talking Therapies model, the service is expected to offer a combination of apps, websites and free telehealth therapy sessions that deliver a type of cognitive behavioural therapy called “low-intensity psychological interventions”. 
The idea is that if we detect psychological distress early, we can prevent some people developing mental illness, and allow mental health experts more time to spend with complex patients. 
It sounds good in theory, but it doesn’t always work in practice. Here’s what the evidence from the UK and elsewhere shows so far – and what we can learn for Australia’s rollout.





What are the benefits of these programs?
In theory, low-intensity psychological interventions that combine digital tools and telehealth sessions offer patients the same “dose” of treatment while needing less therapist time than conventional psychological treatments. These time savings mean more clinical hours for therapists to see more patients. 
Research shows low-intensity interventions can help people improve patients’  mental health, while addressing some big problems in the mental health system such as therapist shortages, long waitlists and the increasing cost of more in-depth therapies.
Looking at service data from UK Talking Therapies clinics, around 50% of UK patients said their mental health was better after four to six sessions with a therapist, either in-person or online depending on availability.
Similar benefits have been shown in other large studies of similar interventions, with most patients getting better within seven therapy sessions. 
The Talking Therapies model has translated well to other European countries such as Norway and Spain, and we have good reason to think it will work in Australia. In Beyond Blue’s NewAccess service, which trialled the model at three sites from 2013-16, most patients saw real improvements in their anxiety and depression.
What are the downsides?
NHS data show 30-50% of people who use low-intensity psychological interventions don’t respond well due to a range of factors like age, employment status, or disability.
The federal government estimates around 150,000 Australians will use the new service each year. 
So if non-response rates are similar here, around 45,000-75,000 Australians will still need a higher intensity level of care to get well, putting them back on already intolerable waitlists. The upcoming walk-in Medicare mental health services may not have capacity to help.
While services like UK’s Talking Therapies are meant to reduce these waiting times this isn’t always the case, particularly in areas where it’s hard to access mental health care. And once in care, patients don’t always get the care they want or deserve. 

A wholly digital service risks alienating some consumers. Blending limited therapist support with apps and websites can be highly effective, but not everyone has high speed Internet access and some Australians prefer no therapy to digital therapy. 
The UK’s Talking Therapies doesn’t seem to address the social determinants of mental illness, such as lack of social connection, unemployment and poverty. We have already seen these impacts in Australia, with single or unemployed people in the  NewAccess trial benefiting less than people with relationships or jobs.
Even more worrying, large-scale mental health services aren’t always culturally responsive. Data from the UK’s Talking Therapies shows cultural minorities not only get less benefit than white people, they’re more likely to get worse after treatment. First Nations and culturally and linguistically diverse Australians deserve better.  
We’re going to need a bigger workforce
A safe, effective Australian Talking Therapies service will need skilled therapists. 
However, the mental health workforce is lagging well behind demand and the government has shown little appetite for investing in training. 

Psychologists were excluded from the recently announced Commonwealth Prac Payment scheme, which pays students to undertake university placements. 
And it’s unclear if any funding for the early intervention service will go to expanding the existing psychology workforce. It already delivers around half of all Medicare mental health services in Australia and is qualified to provide low-intensity psychological interventions. 
Low-intensity psychological interventions can work in Australia, but they can’t replace the bigger, more urgent reform our mental health system needs. More care for some people isn’t enough; we need better mental health for everyone.

Spending too much time on social media and doomscrolling? The problem might be FOMO,https://theconversation.com/spending-too-much-time-on-social-media-and-doomscrolling-the-problem-might-be-fomo-230980,3025629,"Psychology, Social media, FoMO, Internet use, Problematic internet use, Social media use, Fear of missing out, Doomscrolling, New research, Australia New Zealand","
For as long as we have used the internet to communicate and connect with each other, it has influenced how we think, feel and behave.
During the COVID pandemic, many of us were “cut off” from our social worlds through restrictions, lockdowns and mandates. Understandably, many of us tried to find ways to connect online.
Now, as pandemic restrictions have lifted, some of the ways we use the internet have become concerning. Part of what drives problematic internet use may be something most of us are familiar with – the fear of missing out, or FOMO.
In our latest research, my colleagues and I investigated the role FOMO plays in two kinds of  internet use: problematic social media use and “doomscrolling”.





What are FOMO, problematic social media use and doomscrolling?
FOMO is the fear some of us experience when we get a sense of “missing out” on things happening in our social scene. Psychology researchers have been studying FOMO for more than a decade, and it has consistently been linked to mental health and wellbeing, alcohol use and problematic social media use.
Social media use becomes a problem for people when they have difficulty controlling urges to use social media, have difficulty cutting back on use, and where the use has a negative impact on their everyday life.
Doomscrolling is characterised by a need to constantly look at and seek out “bad” news. Doomscrollers may constantly refresh their news feeds or stay up late to read bad news. 
While problematic social media use has been around for a while, doomscrolling seems to be a more recent phenomenon – attracting research attention during and following the pandemic.
What we tried to find out
In our study, we wanted to test the idea that FOMO leads individuals to engage in problematic use behaviours due to their difficulty in managing the “fear” in FOMO.
The key factor, we thought, was emotion regulation – our ability to deal with our emotions. We know some people tend to be good at this, while others find it difficult. In fact, greater difficulties with emotion regulation was linked to experiencing greater acute stress related to COVID.

      Why am I online? Research shows it's often about managing emotions




However, an idea that has been gaining attention recently is interpersonal emotion regulation. This means looking to others to help us regulate our emotions. 
Interpersonal emotion regulation can be helpful (such as “affective engagement”, where someone might listen and talk about your feelings) or unhelpful (such as “co-rumination” or rehashing problems together), depending on the context.
In our analyses, we sought to uncover how both intrapersonal emotion regulation (ability to self-manage our own emotional states) and interpersonal emotion regulation (relying on others to help manage our emotions) accounted for the link between FOMO and problematic social media use, and FOMO and doomscrolling, respectively.
What we found – and what it might mean for the future of internet use
Our findings indicated that people who report stronger FOMO engage in problematic social media use because of difficulty regulating their emotions (intrapersonally), and they look to others for help (interpersonally).
Similarly, people who report stronger FOMO are drawn to doomscrolling because of difficulty regulating their emotions intrapersonally (within themselves). However, we found no link between FOMO and doomscrolling through interpersonal emotion regulation.
We suspect this difference may be due to doomscrolling being more of a solitary activity, occurring outside more social contexts that facilitate interpersonal regulation. For instance, there are probably fewer people with whom to share your emotions while staying up trawling through bad news.
While links between FOMO and doomscrolling have been observed before, our study is among the first to try and account for this theoretically.
We suspect the link between FOMO and doomscrolling may be more about having more of an online presence while things are happening. This would account for intrapersonal emotion regulation failing to help manage our reactions to “bad news” stories as they unfold, leading to doomscrolling.
Problematic social media use, on the other hand, involves a more complex interpersonal context. If someone is feeling the fear of being “left out” and has difficulty managing that feeling, they may be drawn to social media platforms in part to try and elicit help from others in their network.
Getting the balance right
Our findings suggest the current discussions around restricting social media use for young people, while controversial, are important. We need to balance our need for social connection – which is happening increasingly online – with the detrimental consequences  associated with problematic internet use behaviours.
It is important to also consider the nature of social media platforms and how they have changed over time. For example, adolescent social media use patterns across various platforms are associated with different mental health and socialisation outcomes.
Public health policy experts and legislators have quite the challenge ahead of them here. Recent work has shown how loneliness is a contributing factor to all-cause mortality (death from any cause).

      Doomscrolling is literally bad for your health. Here are 4 tips to help you stop




We have long known, too, that social connectedness is good for our mental health. In fact, last year, the World Health Organization established a Commission on Social Connection to help promote the importance of socialisation to our lives.
The recent controversy in the United States around the ownership of TikTok illustrates how central social media platforms are to our lives and ways of interacting with one another. We need to consider the rights of individuals  to use them as they please, but understand that governments carry the responsibility of protecting users from harm  and safeguarding their privacy.

If you feel concerned about problematic social media use or doomscrolling, you can speak to a healthcare or mental health professional. You can also call Lifeline on 13 11 14, or 13 YARN (13 92 76) to yarn with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander crisis supporters.

"We gave 60,000 food products a âplanetary healthâ star rating â see how your favourites stack up",https://theconversation.com/we-gave-60-000-food-products-a-planetary-health-star-rating-see-how-your-favourites-stack-up-228363,3025628,"Food, Food labelling, Environment, Consumer behaviour, Food sustainability, Apps, Life cycle assessment (LCA), Sustainable agriculture, Health star rating, Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, planetary health, Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), New research, Australia New Zealand","
Lasagne or risotto? Muesli bar or brownie? What’s better for the planet? How do you know for sure? 
We’ve crunched the numbers on greenhouse gas emissions so you don’t have to. All you need is a smartphone with our free ecoSwitch app. 
Simply scan the product’s barcode to check the “planetary health rating”. Then see if it’s worth switching to another product with a better rating. 
If every Australian swapped higher-emission products for very similar but lower-emission products, total emissions from household groceries would fall by a quarter (26%). Taking this a step further, consistently switching to the “less similar” lower-emission option – such as swapping to a different type of bread – would cut emissions from household groceries by a whopping 71%. 





Devising ‘planetary health ratings’ for food
Australians are becoming increasingly aware that their food choices have consequences. 
Many would like to see sustainability information on product packaging, to help them make more environmentally-friendly choices.
But in the absence of industry-wide standards and regulation, unofficial logos and vague claims are proliferating. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has found misleading “greenwashing” labels are particularly prevalent in the food and beverage sector.
Frustrated by a lack of action, we devised our own labelling system. 
First, we carried out a total life-cyle assessment of greenhouse gas emissions for more than 60,000 packaged food products. 
We used the list of ingredients as a starting point. Then we estimated the weight of each ingredient, using a mathematical formula. 
We sourced existing information on total greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production of each ingredient. And finally, we put it all together. 
Each product now has a “planetary health rating”, which is a measure of its emissions on a ten-point scale from half a star (high emissions) to five stars (low emissions). This is consistent with the Health Star Rating format.
Through the ecoSwitch app, consumers can see how selected packaged food items rate and then consider more environmentally friendly alternatives. The free, user-friendly app is now available from the App Store and Google Play.

Sobering revelations
Our new analysis of the ecoSwitch database, combined with sales data, delivers a sobering picture of the Australian diet. 
The food and drink we bring into our homes each year represents total emissions of about 31.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.
The main offenders are meat and meat products (49% of emissions), dairy products (17%) and non-alcoholic drinks (16%). 
Cutting consumption of these products can help rein in the food system’s contribution to global warming.
But packaged foods contain many ingredients, with differing levels of emissions. This is where ecoSwitch can help. Take soup, for example. 
One type of pumpkin soup available in Australia receives a planetary health rating of 5 stars, while a chicken and sweetcorn soup receives 1.5 stars. In the snack bar category, a particular fruit and oat muesli bar receives 4 stars while a chocolate and oat bar receives 1 star. 
Such large variation within product categories shows how much difference consumers can make through their choices. 
The ecoSwitch app also provides the health star rating for each food product in the database. This is very useful considering the health star ratings are only displayed on one-third of products, because it is a voluntary system. 
Fortunately, in most instances, the more sustainable choice is also the healthier choice, so consumers don’t need to trade off personal health for planetary health.

Driving change across the food supply chain
The food and beverage sector ranks second only to the energy sector in terms of global contributions to greenhouse emissions. Patterns of consumption in higher-income countries such as Australia must change if we are to meet our climate goals. 
Incorporating sustainability considerations into the Australian Dietary Guidelines is worthwhile, but this alone is insufficient. Voluntary, or better still, mandatory food labelling is needed to reduce the production of high-emission products (such as meat and dairy) in favour of low-emission products (such as vegetables). 
We believe the ecoSwitch app has the potential to trigger positive change along the entire food supply chain. Once consumers have access to more comprehensive information about products, manufacturers will change their production processes to achieve more favourable scores. This was the case with nutrition labelling, and there is every reason to expect a similar response to sustainability labelling. 
Governments can also use the information to monitor the food sector, identify particularly problematic products and product categories, and offer incentives – or penalise companies accordingly. 
Knowledge is power, and ecoSwitch gives consumers the knowledge they need to make more sustainable food choices. In the absence of other reliable information, such knowledge is vital to help shoppers identify sustainable packaged food options in the supermarket.
Answers to questions like those posed at the start of this article will depend to a certain extent on the specific products being considered. But typically, risotto is better than lasagne. One pumpkin, leek and spinach risotto, for example, had a planetary health star rating of 4.5, compared to a beef lasagne with 0.5 stars. And cereal (muesli) bars are usually better than brownies. One apricot and almond muesli bar had a planetary health star rating of 4.5, while a fudge chocolate brownie bar received 0.5 stars.

38% of Gen Z Australians identify as spiritual and half of them believe in karma. Why is spirituality so popular?,https://theconversation.com/38-of-gen-z-australians-identify-as-spiritual-and-half-of-them-believe-in-karma-why-is-spirituality-so-popular-223203,3025627,"Religion, Yoga, Environment, Spirituality, Generation Z, Gen Z","
Spirituality is increasingly popular with young Australians: recent research shows 38% of Gen Z Australians identify as spiritual.
It also reports 50% of them believe in karma, 29% in reincarnation and 20% in astrology. When it comes to activities equated with spirituality, 28% of Gen Z Australians practise meditation and 22% practise yoga. 
In Australia, spirituality is strongly, enduringly central to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and culturally and religiously diverse communities. Yet until recently, spirituality has received far less attention than religion.
Spirituality may be good for the environment too. The most recent trend in studies of religion – frequently associated with spirituality – is a reported close connection with nature. This was shared by 76% of Gen Z Australians. 
In Australia, we believe spirituality is expressed as a down-to-earth “relational naturalism”. It’s particularly linked to Indigenous, Buddhist, Hindu and eco-spiritualities that acknowledge sacredness in and connection with the natural world, not just in heavenly heights.
Spiritual or not, nature-based connection is certainly on the rise. Young Australians also state that their affinity with nature informs their ethics –  in terms of what they eat and consume, and their environmental activism.
So what is spirituality? How is it different from religion? And why is it so popular?

What is spirituality?
Spirituality is a connection with something greater than the self – which could be God, consciousness or nature – that results in a sense of responsibility to care for oneself and others. It often includes the natural world.
Spirituality has often been seen as the “individualised good-guy”, as a counterpart to the “institutional bad-guy” of religion. But this stereotypical binary is increasingly outdated.
Spirituality, like religion, is mostly practised in groups, or in communities. Often, it’s with a charismatic leader, and follows certain codes of practice, related to physical postures or activities, diet and lifestyle more generally.
According to Warraimaay historian Victoria Grieve-Williams, spirituality is deeply relational and ethical, honouring interconnections with human and more-than-human beings. 

In his bestselling book Sand Talk: How Indigenous Thinking can Save the World, Aboriginal scholar Tyson Yunkaporta also stresses complexity, relationality and connectedness as central principles of First People’s wisdom. 
People can identify as spiritual but not religious, or as religious and spiritual. Both religion and spirituality can be social and inform how we live in the world. 
In the Gen Z Australians survey, 22% self-identified as spiritual but not religious, with a further 16% identifying as both religious and spiritual.
How spiritual are Australians?
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have rich and diverse spiritual traditions. “The Creator Spirit was with us long before the British invaded our lands, and our faith has been nurtured over thousands of years,” writes Bidjara theologian and professor, Aunty Anne Pattel-Gray.
Grieves-Williams notes that connection to and responsibility for land and waterways – learned and shared through story – are central to Aboriginal spirituality. 
Trawloolway theologian Garry Deverell explains that First Nations spirituality “begins with the earth”.
Through colonisation and migration, Europeans brought Christian and Jewish religions, which also include spiritual dimensions, to Australia. And many immigrants, particularly from the Asia-Pacific region, first introduced their religious and spiritual traditions to Australia in the 19th century, before the introduction of the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act. 
Many of their spiritual frameworks also stress interdependency with and compassion for all lifeforms.
Spirituality is big business
So-called Western interest in spirituality had earlier iterations in theosophy, an esoteric philosophy based on older religions and myths, and spiritualism, a way of life combining philosophy, science and religion. Both were popular at the turn of the 20th century. 
But spirituality boomed globally as part of the alternative 1960s counterculture. In Australia, it took off after the 1973 Aquarius Festival in Nimbin, Northern New South Wales.  

Since then, interest in spirituality and the expanding $4.4 trillion wellness industry has grown exponentially. 
This includes the mainstreaming of teachings through social media, and of practices such as meditation, yoga, retreats, conscious dance, plant medicine, astrology and tarot. Many of these derive from Indigenous, Buddhist or Hindu traditions.
Some spiritual and wellness influencers can problematically appropriate these traditions. However, others respectfully acknowledge the origins and lineages of their spiritual practices. 
“True yoga is not just a workout,” says Indian-American yoga teacher and researcher Rina Deshpande, who urges people to learn the history of their practice. “Classically, it is an ancient Indian philosophy espousing an eight-limbed approach to conscious living.”
At the turn of the 21st century, some experts predicted spirituality would eclipse religion, given this thriving “spiritual marketplace”. 
Spiritual movements and wellness influencers have gained prominence through critiquing the ills of modern capitalist consumerism, with a focus on personal and planetary wellbeing. Some high-profile examples include Jay Shetty, entrepreneur and host of the podcast On Purpose, and Australian Sarah Wilson, author of I Quit Sugar.
Many of these influencers focus on self-care and the need to slow down and be mindful – and to foster a more respectful and sustainable relationship with ourselves and the natural world. At the same time, some turn their goods and services into products to be marketed, increasingly through social media, to lift their profiles.
Spiritual risks and harms
While spirituality was previously associated with hippies and “peace, love and mung beans”, reports of spiritual harms – emotional, sexual and financial abuse – are increasingly being revealed in both religious and spiritual communities. 
This includes many allegations of abuse by students of prominent gurus such as Tibetan Buddhist Sogyal Rinpoche, famous for his teachings on death and dying, and Bikram Choudhury, founder of Bikram yoga.

The uptake of conspiracy theories in spiritual communities – and vaccine resistance within them – have also been deeply troubling in recent years. This “conspirituality” is linked to spiritual exceptionalism and bypassing, where distrust of medical and state authority, combined with individual body sovereignty, led to denying the suffering the COVID pandemic caused society’s most vulnerable. 
Not all ‘woo-Anon’
Conspirituality during COVID certainly made spirituality more public. It also seemed to draw more men into spiritual movements, with some Australian male conspiritual leaders mobilising “spiritual warriors” to “cosmic war”.
However, in a pilot study on Spirituality and Wellness in Australia conducted at the height of the pandemic, only a minority of self-identified “spiritual” people among the 202 participants had conspiritual views.
Just 2% of participants thought the virus was caused by global elites, pharmaceutical companies, aliens or demonic forces –  and just 5% said they would not be vaccinated. By contrast, 88% supported lockdowns and 91% supported mask wearing.
This is significant, given that media coverage of conspirituality tends to overstate its prevalence within wellness communities. 
It’s vital not to tar all spiritual people as “woo-Anon”, particularly as they represent an increasingly significant percentage of the Australian population.
Australian spiritual influencers, notably Sarah Wilson, also played a significant role in countering conspirituality at the peak of the pandemic, by drawing on spiritual narratives of relational and compassionate care.
The uptake of conspiracy theories among spiritual communities remains concerning. But research reveals relational spiritual narratives and practices can also play a significant role in both personal and planetary wellbeing. This includes countering vaccine resistance – in and beyond Australia.
Spirituality can be experienced in personal ways, but it is also complex and communal. It is important to be aware of spirituality’s potential benefits and risks.

Climate change and mental health: How extreme heat can affect mental illnesses,https://theconversation.com/climate-change-and-mental-health-how-extreme-heat-can-affect-mental-illnesses-230172,3025626,"Climate change, Mental health, Weather, Schizophrenia, Depression, Mental illness, Summer, Heat wave, Hot weather, Extreme heat, heat dome","
During heat waves, hospital admissions for mental health spike. The past 10 years were the hottest on record, and as we prepare for another scorcher of a summer, it’s time to take steps to increase our preparedness for extreme heat. 
The potential for heat stress, heat exhaustion and heat stroke are well known hazards of extreme heat. Yet, physical health is not the only factor to consider under extreme heat; mental health can also suffer. Many people can relate to the sleepless nights during hot summer months, as well as anecdotal experiences of irritation and aggression when thermally uncomfortable. 
But for those living with mental illnesses, the hazard of extreme heat is more dire than temperamental responses to day-to-day disruptions. From my research in Phoenix, Ariz. and the work of others during the 2021 heat dome in British Columbia, we know that the heat is exacerbating existing mental illnesses, increasing likelihoods of hospitalization and even death under warmer conditions for people with schizophrenia.
The interactions between environment and health are increasingly identified by researchers as public health concerns as air and water quality issues, as well as death tolls from heat, make headlines. Research has shown that lower socioeconomic groups, racialized people and the unhoused, are at greater risk of exposure to hotter conditions, while older adults are more vulnerable to hotter conditions.





Heat and mental illness

The relationship between mental illness and temperature has only recently been quantified as medical records and understanding of mental illnesses have improved. My work as an urban climatologist focuses on the impact of urbanization and heat on human health. I explore the variety of unexpected impacts of heat on people. Specifically, I’ve studied the population diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
Schizophrenia is a mental illness that disrupts transmission of information to the brain. The part of the brain most impacted also houses our thermoregulatory functions. It’s the part that tells us we’re too hot and to start sweating or we’re too cold and should shiver to stay warm. 
So those with schizophrenia aren’t able to respond to extreme heat the way the general population does; their bodies aren’t telling them to take precautions. Further, the medications used to address schizophrenia also raise core body temperature. This means that when taking the medication, people with schizophrenia are closer to the thresholds for heat stress and stroke than the general population.
In studying hospitalizations for schizophrenia in Phoenix (where summertime overnight low temperatures are, on average, at 30 C) between 2006 and 2014, I found that minimum air temperature (the overnight low temperature) has a significant relationship to the number of hospitalizations for schizophrenia on that day and the following day. Around three per cent of all schizophrenia hospitalizations during that time period can be attributed to the overnight low temperature.
The risk is highest in both extremely cold (lower than 3 C) and extremely hot conditions (higher than 30 C). These hospitalizations cost the Phoenix health-care system over US$2 million (in 2024 USD). Certainly, Canadians see much colder conditions than 3 C at night but rarely experience overnight lows above 30 C; however, the 2021 heat dome resulted in over 600 deaths in B.C. and researchers found that schizophrenia was the chronic condition most associated with risk of death during the extreme heat. 
Extreme heat can have devastating impacts on those living with mental illness, our health-care system and our communities.

Schizophrenia is not the most common mental illness in Canada. However, it can serve as an example of how environmental issues can affect mental illness. One in every five Canadians experiences a mental illness each year. More than 250,000 Canadian youth experience major depression and systemic inequities exacerbated by disparities in treatment and care for those experiencing mental illness.
While there are many different factors potentially contributing to mental illness, heat plays a pervasive role in a wide range of mental health issues. Taking what steps we can to reduce this burden on those living with mental illnesses may also have knock-on benefits to the rest of society, such as reduced use of hospital emergency departments during heat waves. 
Coping with climate change
So if climate change is continuing to bring hotter summers, what can be done to prevent these hospitalizations and deaths? There are measures that have broader benefits in addition to improving mental illness outcomes during extreme heat. 
A common first step is ensuring access for all Canadians to air conditioning. Statistics Canada highlighted the importance of air conditioning for vulnerable populations. Warming conditions mean parts of Canada that didn’t need air conditioning 30 years ago can now become oppressively hot inside buildings without proper cooling.  
Yet, air conditioning is dependent on the electrical grid and continues to produce waste heat and greenhouse gas emissions. There is a better way: designing our cities to be greener. There are a lot of previously known benefits to greening cities; reducing the urban heat island, improving air quality and in some cases increasing property values (both positive and negative outcomes).

      Residential green spaces protect growing cities against climate change




However, there are some mental health benefits too. I contributed to a review of urban greenery mitigation science and highlighted the mental health benefits, including reduced depression, irritation and aggression. 
Urban green space has been shown to improve mood, self-esteem and even speed up recovery from illness. So as the temperature spikes and you switch on the air conditioning and reach for the cold drinks, remember there are impacts to us all beyond just physical health, and pause to note how the heat is influencing your mood. 
Extreme heat will continue to impact Canada (and increasingly so as the climate changes). However, the negative impacts on the most vulnerable, including those living with mental illness can, in part, be reduced by taking steps to ensure our cities are benefiting us all.

NZ Budget 2024: the coalition needs a circuit breaker â the National Party most of all,https://theconversation.com/nz-budget-2024-the-coalition-needs-a-circuit-breaker-the-national-party-most-of-all-230392,3025530,"New Zealand, tax cuts, NZ ACT Party, NZ National Party, Christopher Luxon, Nicola Willis, NZ First Party, NZ Budget 2024","
When finance minister Nicola Willis stands to deliver her first budget tomorrow, it will be a significant moment for her personally, but also for the coalition government, and her own National Party in particular.
The budget is the most consequential event in the annual political calendar. It expresses the fundamental democratic principle that the executive branch of government is drawn from, and accountable to, the legislature. 
Constitutional probity aside, the budget also matters for purely political reasons. Willis has promised neither a spending spree nor austerity. If there is a “middle course”, it will lie between the promised tax cuts and the spending cuts that pay for them.
We can expect the finance minister to paint a dramatic picture of public service back-office (and by implication previous government) profligacy. Willis will likely pitch her budget as delivering “front line” services and helping the “squeezed middle” we heard so much about during the election.





Above all, though, she must convince people the government has a plan. The wider narrative always matters. This year it matters more than usual – especially for a National Party still struggling to assert its seniority in the coalition.
Ideological tensions
The government made a great show of ticking off the 49 items in its 100-day action plan – so much so, there is now a narrative vaccuum. People know what the government has done but are less sure about what it intends to do next. 
Prime Minister Christopher Luxon’s taste for regularly reporting on milestones is tactical, not strategic. You can’t tell much of a story about milestones, so one of Willis’ most important jobs will be to lay out the government’s overarching vision.
It’s a tough time for overarching visions, though. The cost of living remains high and unemployment is rising. Public service cuts are starting to bite and – contrary to assurances – are taking a toll on the delivery of front-line services. 
National campaigned on the promise of getting New Zealand “back on track”. But in one recent poll, 52% said the country was on the “wrong track” (up from 41% in February). Resetting that narrative is the challenge.
Furthermore, tensions with Māori – and those non-Māori who disagree with ACT leader David Seymour’s views on Te Tiriti o Waitangi and the Waitangi Tribunal – continue to simmer.
The government’s flagship Fast-track Approvals Bill is also hitting headwinds. Federated Farmers’ concern that the bill will infringe private property rights is especially telling, and has brought to the surface a tension between NZ First’s economic nationalism and ACT’s libertarian inclinations. 
That is one of several questions about the coalition the budget will seek to smooth over. Others include apparent double standards over charter schools (whose students will be exempt from the cellphone ban imposed on other schools), potential ministerial conflicts of interest, and the government’s extensive use of executive power.

Reasserting the National brand
It is tempting to suggest these various challenges lie behind the government’s slightly anaemic performance in recent polls. But while the numbers do point to a general lack of enthusiasm for the current state of the nation, there are still two-and-a-half years to the next election – several lifetimes in politics. 
Nonetheless, the government could do with a circuit breaker – ideally one that allows the National Party to start distinguishing itself from its governing partners. 
Everything in a three-party coalition – from places in cabinet, space on the legislative agenda, and time in front of the media – is in short supply. So far, NZ First and ACT have consumed more of those resources than their respective electoral support arguably warrants.
ACT’s David Seymour, in particular, has been making at least as much public noise as Luxon, and has not been averse to questioning the authority of the prime minister (including over ACT’s proposed Treaty principles legislation). 
This is the price of National’s support at last year’s election being its lowest since 2002 (the one-off COVID election of 2020 aside). Now beholden to two minor parties exercising an outsized influence on the policy agenda, the so-called “natural party of government” finds itself unnaturally compromised.
If National – and the prime minister – overindulge the more extreme ideological and policy positions of those small parties, it risks being seen as weak. Clip those parties’ wings too severely and they could bring down the government.
So there is plenty riding on Nicola Willis’ big moment tomorrow. Getting the numbers right is important. Telling a compelling story is crucial.

Arts graduate education in Canada should be redesigned around studentsâ and societyâs needs,https://theconversation.com/arts-graduate-education-in-canada-should-be-redesigned-around-students-and-societys-needs-228864,3025326,"Arts, Universities, STEM, Arts education, university education, Public good, Canadian research, humanities education","
The recent federal announcement increasing doctoral and post-doctoral stipends is welcome. But money alone will not solve the challenges of graduate education in Canada. This is particularly true for social science and humanities (arts) graduate education.
The link between arts graduate degrees and careers is weak. Many arts PhDs aspire to become professors but Canada produces far more doctorates than available academic jobs. Although professional (course-based) masters degrees are typically very career-focused, many graduates of research Master of Arts (MA) degrees report struggling to launch a career.  
In our new book For the Public Good: Reimagining Arts Graduate Programs in Canadian Universities, we put forward a vision of arts graduate degrees that links them to Canada’s public good challenges — such as political polarization, income inequality and Indigenous reconciliation. 
We argue that degrees must be redesigned with deliberate purpose around students’ and society’s actual needs. Student talent needs to be developed in an efficient and inclusive way, and linked broadly to key public goods. 





‘What can you do with that?’
While students continue to seek and enjoy advanced study of the social sciences and humanities, the question of “What can you do with that?” resonates far too much. 
Many students themselves are unhappy. Completion times are longer and dropout rates are much higher in arts than in STEM graduate programs. Graduate students’ stressors are formidable, with poor mental well-being contributing to decisions to drop out.
Undergraduate arts degrees have long been seen as “training for life.” But graduate students are older and practical concerns become paramount. 
And since many graduate students receive government funding (in the form of scholarships and teaching or research assistant positions) to study, graduate education also receives far more public investment. It’s reasonable to ask whether this is a good use of funds when many students seem to have few job prospects.

Not a matter of slash and cut
Some advocate a simple solution: slash and cut these “impractical” degrees. However, as political scientists and public policy scholars, we know that Canada needs the arts, with its insights into human behaviour and thinking, more than ever. We argue for reimagining arts graduate programs to align with Canada’s most pressing public good issues. 
Canada’s thorniest problems cannot be solved by science or technology alone. Their limits are seen as we grapple with the ethics of AI and complex human aspects of apparent “scientific” problems, like why some people refuse to be vaccinated.

      What is intelligence? For millennia, western literature has suggested it may be a liability




Canada needs arts graduate education of a different kind than what is currently offered. As experienced administrators who have each held university leadership positions, we know the system right now is not working.  
Erratic evolution of graduate education
Canadian arts graduate education has evolved erratically rather than strategically. The system is distorted by inappropriate funding models that give little guidance to students. They also incentivize universities to pursue quantity over quality. 
Supervision models differ sharply across disciplines. In most STEM disciplines, graduate students work in faculty-led labs in teams on common projects. 
In the humanities and most social sciences, graduate student research is almost entirely self-directed. (The fine arts, such as theatre and music, are more collaborative but are not our focus here.) While providing maximum freedom, this can lead students down dead-end alleys. 
Grant agencies like the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council prioritize research training to produce “high-quality personnel.” But many arts graduate programs have not yet done enough to help students translate their graduate education to a meaningful career. 

Students now left to struggle
The training arts graduate students receive is closely linked to academic career skills. In fact, arts students are better trained than ever for academic research jobs. But there are few available positions. Arts graduate students are then left to struggle to articulate how these academic career skills transfer to other sectors. 
We call for an enhanced focus in arts degrees on what linguistics scholar and university president Joseph Aoun calls “human literacy” — the ability to engage others and think creatively about human relationships. Students also need technological and data literacy: an understanding of how things work, and how to analyze large amounts of information. 




      Read more:
      Writing is a technology that restructures thought — and in an AI age, universities need to teach it more




While the “digital humanities” have embraced aspects of this, we call for a more widespread and systematic approach. This doesn’t mean turning sociologists into software engineers. But it does mean developing advanced skills to interpret data and its human impacts, in ways that are useful beyond academia. 
There is still a strong place for theoretical, curiosity-based arts research. After all, students are choosing research graduate degrees over professional training programs precisely because they seek intellectual challenge and discovery, not just job training. But there could be closer links between this theoretical, curiosity-based research, students’ employment or vocational needs and needs of communities.
Funding realignment needed
Achieving this demands effort at all levels within and beyond universities. It requires a realigning of the mechanisms, especially funding, on which the system is built. 
Faculty and departments must shift from an “academia-first” mentality in their program objectives. Universities must find ways to pursue quality over quantity, rather than the opposite. 
Governments and funding agencies need to shift to funding models appropriate for arts rather than borrowed from STEM, encouraging talent-building with a focus on the public good. Employers must be open to the powerful “soft skills” that arts graduates bring, rather than exclusively hiring on technical “hard skills.” 
This is not a quick fix. Changing the arts graduate education status quo will require innovation and imagination. But universities and policymakers have a chance to take the first steps.

"Itâs hard to find fossil skin, but a rare discovery reveals clues about the evolution from water to land",https://theconversation.com/its-hard-to-find-fossil-skin-but-a-rare-discovery-reveals-clues-about-the-evolution-from-water-to-land-225501,3025268,"Evolution, Fossils, Vertebrates","
Fossilized skin and other soft tissues are exceedingly rare, and it is only under special conditions that these rarest of fossils are preserved. 
Most skin is preserved as impressions in the rock, but under rare conditions and incalculable odds, a 3D fossil of the actual skin can form. These fossils provide an exceptional window into the appearances, evolution and anatomies of prehistoric animals.
As graduate students in the Reisz Lab of vertebrate palaeontology at the University of Toronto, we study such fossils to help answer critical questions surrounding major evolutionary innovations.
Fossilized skin
Our study, published in Current Biology, details the remarkable discovery of not only impressions, but also a 3D fossil of skin as isolated, razor thin sheets of carbon from a 289 to 286 million-year-old cave system. These fossils were found and donated to the Reisz Lab by Bill May (a prolific local collector). 





They have a texture strikingly similar to modern crocodiles, and provide insights into how some of the earliest tetrapods evolved to live on land. The fossilized skin is so well preserved that its internal structures can be identified and is the oldest such fossil currently known.

These fossils belong to some kind of amniote, which is a diverse group of animals represented today by mammals, reptiles and birds. The earliest amniotes were reptiles, and are thought to have emerged from prehistoric amphibians in the late Carboniferous period roughly 318 million years ago. 
These early amniotes saw many evolutionary innovations that allowed them to adapt to the challenges of a fully terrestrial lifestyle, including several modifications to the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. 
Skin for living on land
One of the biggest hurdles to living on land is water retention. The first tetrapods to lead largely terrestrial lives were amphibians whose skin was prone to drying out. As such, they remained bound to an aquatic environment and lived a semi-aquatic lifestyle for at least part of their lives. These early amphibians even retained bony scales typical of their fish ancestors.
It was not until the evolution of reptiles, with their skin especially suited for water retention, that these pioneers were able to adopt fully terrestrial lifestyles. This involved a thickened epidermis with differentiated alpha and beta keratin proteins, thereby forming the first epidermal scales able to provide a durable, impermeable corneous surface much like that of modern reptiles.
We also detail the preservation of such corneous bands of the epidermis in the early reptile Captorhinus aguti. These bands are arranged in a concentric pattern along the animal’s back, an arrangement that would have promoted flexibility during the side-to-side undulating motion of reptile walking. Similar banding of epidermal scales is also observed most prominently in modern worm lizards.

A perfect cave system
These exceptional fossils were discovered in a cave system near Richards Spur, Oklahoma. This cave system consists of expansive karst networks, which often appear as vertical fissures carved into surrounding limestone by water. 

This locality is known for being the richest assemblage of terrestrial vertebrates from the entire Paleozoic Era. The abundance of largely disarticulated skeletons is likely the result of deposition of the remains during large monsoonal rains. Articulated or semi-articulated remains are less common, and may be the result of animals falling into these caves or being washed in as one piece.
Cave conditions are known to promote preservation of animal remains through desiccation, permeation by mineral rich ground water and burial by fine sediments. 
At the Richards Spur locality, such preservation was likely aided by oil seep hydrocarbons, which have stained most fossils black or brown. Saturation of remains prior to or shortly after deposition likely influenced the growth of minerals involved in making the fossils so that they were more likely to be well fossilized. Desiccation also likely played a critical role in the exceptional preservation of skin by prolonging its structural longevity prior to fossilization. 
These remarkable skin fossils not only shed light on critical innovations necessary for the conquest of land by early amniotes, but also highlight the unique influence of cave conditions and oil seep hydrocarbons on the production of exceptional fossils.

Religious discrimination against LGBTQIA+ children is deeply rooted in Europeâs religious schools,https://theconversation.com/religious-discrimination-against-lgbtqia-children-is-deeply-rooted-in-europes-religious-schools-226890,3025202,"Religion, LGBTQ+ youth, LGBTQI+, The Conversation Europe","
Religious education is commonplace in public schools across Europe, and is obligatory in many. In some European countries such as Slovakia, religious bodies are responsible for religious education curricula, and in Bulgaria religious schools follow their own curricula for religious education, which can include teachings that condemn LGBTQIA+ identities. This creates environments where LGBTQIA+ children feel unsafe, unwelcome, or unable to express their identities.
This is especially pertinent at a time when the far right is on the rise. Indeed, much religious objection to LGBTQIA+ rights is done in the name of “protecting children”, and studies have explored how right wing politics has made children – and with them education – into a political football.
Religious communities and LGBTQIA+ children
In conservative religious communities, LGBTQIA+ children and adults alike can face rejection from their families, leading to higher risks of homelessness, mental health issues, and social isolation. Religious leaders and institutions can play a significant role in exacerbating or mitigating these challenges, depending on their stance and teachings on LGBTQIA+ issues. 
Across Europe, many national legal systems still marginalise LGBTQIA+ people. Discrimination is more pronounced in religious communities, but a lack of information about religious schools makes it a challenge to pin down this particular aspect of discrimination between different countries.





41% of the EU is religious. Malta, Romania and Cyprus are the top three, with over 75% of their population describing themselves as religious, but these countries are far from equal when it comes to accepting differences.

Religion does not equate to discrimination
Malta, Romania and Cyprus all have deep historical and cultural connections to Christianity. However, the extent and nature of religious influence on school education varies widely among these countries due to their different historical contexts, state policies, and the degree of secularisation. 
The Maltese Constitution establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion, and private schools are affiliated with the Catholic Church. However, it has also recently made significant strides in promoting LGBTQIA+ rights, achieving a score of 89% and ranking top of the ILGA Rainbow Europe map for the last 8 years, surpassing more secular nations like Iceland and Belgium. 
Romania is an Eastern Orthodox Christian society, where the church has significant influence on cultural and social matters. Religious education focuses on Orthodox Christianity, which forms part of the public school curriculum. Acceptance and protection of LGBTQIA+ people is very low, with a score of 19% on the Rainbow Europe map. The religious right in Romania has pushed to prohibit any mention of “sexual education” or “gender identity” in schools.
Cyprus is governed by the autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church, and also features a minority Sunni Islamic faith in the North. Religious education in Cyprus is included in the curriculum of public schools, but there are tensions between the Turkish-Cypriot Muslim north and the Christian south. Both communities are broadly homophobic, as reflected in the country’s Rainbow map score of 37%. 
Both Romania and Cyprus are societies where LGBTQIA+ people report experiencing discrimination daily.
In Romania, there is a broadly held assumption that queer youth cannot be religious, or that they will give up queer sexuality to belong in religious spaces. However, extensive research has demonstrated that being queer and religious are not mutually exclusive. 
Malta is the outlier, as it offers a model for beginning cultural change. Legal protections and societal acceptance of the LGBTQIA+ community have made significant progress, yet this has not impacted schooling as much as one might hope. Sex education still emphasises abstinence, and challenges related to homophobia and transphobia persist in schools. 
Malta is far from the only country that balances religion and tolerance – Spain and Ireland are also deeply Catholic countries that have made advances in LGBTQIA+ rights.
For the EU to develop a comprehensive understanding of the situations in Romania, Cyprus, Bulgaria and Slovakia, investigation into recent personal experiences within these countries is needed. This approach needs to provide a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by LGBTQIA+ youth at school and an assessment of the relationship between religious education and homophobia.
Advocacy and change
There are numerous LGBTQIA+ advocacy groups and allies within religious communities across Europe working to address and reduce discrimination. 
With elections looming and reactionary, ultra-religious far right factions expected to make big gains, there is a lot at stake for LGBTQIA+ youth.
Yet, while parts of Europe have made progress toward LGBTQIA+ equality, religious discrimination in schools remains a challenge, particularly in countries with close relationships between religion and the State.

Fears over future of the car industry as sales fall and spare parts become scarce,https://theconversation.com/fears-over-future-of-the-car-industry-as-sales-fall-and-spare-parts-become-scarce-229556,3025092,"Climate change, Car industry, Motorists, Net zero emissions, Car use, Give me perspective, Electric vehicles (EVs)","
Much money and time has been spent recently persuading people not to be so reliant on cars. And there are certainly good reasons – for our health and  the environment – to move about more on foot, by bike or on trains.  
Yet cars are still an essential form of transport across the world. In many countries, including the UK, outside of the few metropolitan areas with decent public transport, people depend on them. 
But car owners face an increasingly difficult choice. For many, electric vehicles are still too expensive and considered too risky in terms of driving range, battery costs and charging infrastructure.
Private customers are not buying as many of them as was expected, and are choosing to keep hold of their old petrol and diesel cars instead. 





Yet at the same time, car manufacturers are shifting their production to electric vehicles, and have reduced making replacement parts for the petrol and diesel vehicles. 
Simply put, there are not enough spare parts to keep all the older vehicles running. And the longer people keep their cars, the more spare parts are going to be needed. 
Waiting times and costs for MOTs and servicing have already started to increase, and will continue to do so. And a low supply of spare parts means the prices for those parts will also increase. 
As a result, some older cars will become unusable, sitting in garages for weeks or even months, awaiting replacement parts. But the original manufacturer may not have any, and will not be making any more. 
The consequence of having a vehicle off the road will mean increased hardship for families in terms of commutes, school runs, grocery shopping and any other day-to-day transportation needs.  
This situation means that certain petrol and diesel secondhand cars, which have good availability of parts, will become more valuable. For example, those manufactured by VW, Audi, Seat and Skoda are all built on the same basic engineering platform, so parts are plentiful. But for the owners of other makes, such as Jaguar Land Rover and Kia, getting hold of spare parts will be more problematic. 
This will have a knock-on effect for some manufacturers. A lack of spare parts stock will probably damage their reputation along the supply chain, from mechanics and garages to car dealerships and potential customers.  

Then there is the complication of the UK’s zero emissions vehicle mandate, which requires 22% of all new car sales to be electric vehicles. Car manufacturers who fail to hit this target – which also exists in other countries – face fines of around £15,000 for every vehicle they miss their target by. 
As a result, some of them will probably end up choosing to stop taking orders for petrol, diesel and hybrid cars, forcing customers to wait or go elsewhere. This will put additional pressure on demand for used cars, and the spare parts those used cars need. 
The situation would be much improved if people were happy to buy electric vehicles. But for the moment, it seems they are just too expensive, have limited distance range, and can be inconvenient to charge – especially if you do not have a driveway (and 40% of UK households do not). 
The wrong direction
Even the mega factories of China – producing cars that sell for approximately 17% of western prices – cannot help, as they are subject to huge tariffs.
Instead, the motoring public are understandably confused and cautious – and hanging on to the cars they already own. 
This is obviously bad news for the environment. There are currently 45 million electric vehicles in the world, a number which the International Energy Agency says will need to rise to 790 million if net zero is to be achieved by 2050. That equates to a growth in sales of 27% every year, which is just not happening.
Something needs to give – and in the UK, where the automotive sector contributes £20.2 billion a year to the Treasury and employs 168,000 people, things need to move faster if the critical factors of the supply chain are to be resolved.   
A situation where most households find it unaffordable to drive electric cars, but can’t find the parts necessary to keep their old cars running, is not tenable.  
From a purely pragmatic perspective, politicians may ultimately be forced to change their zero emissions mandates and targets to keep people – and economies – moving. This would be a huge backward step for the planet. But for motorists trying to do the right thing, the road ahead looks increasingly uncertain.

Womenâs sports are thriving in Canada â hereâs how to ensure it stays that way,https://theconversation.com/womens-sports-are-thriving-in-canada-heres-how-to-ensure-it-stays-that-way-230281,3025091,"Sport, Sports, Elite sport, Women's sport, Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), Professional sport, Elite sports, Professional sports, Women's sports, Professional sports franchises","
In Canada, and the Toronto region in particular, the visibility of high-profile women in sports is on the rise. Whether it’s on the court, ice, pitch or even on the bench, women are making their mark and inspiring future generations.
The successful first season of the Professional Women’s Hockey League (PWHL) and expansions announced in the Women’s National Basketball Association (WNBA) are testaments to this growing momentum.
The foundation for the excitement has been laid. According to a report commissioned by Canadian Women & Sport, 17 million Canadians indicate they are fans of women’s sport. And on Feb. 16, the PWHL’s first game at Scotiabank Arena set a league and women’s hockey attendance record with a crowd of 19,285.
The WNBA played a preseason game in Toronto in 2023 to a sold-out crowd, and has seen unprecedented growth in interest over the last five years. Viewership increased 21 per cent from the 2022 WNBA season across its national television partners — ABC, CBS, ESPN and ESPN2 — and engagement on socials and sports betting sites have set new records.





To say that women’s sport in North America is thriving is an understatement. The question now is: what does it take for these leagues, and others focused on women’s sporting excellence, to sustain and build upon their success?
Core values of women’s sport
Within the Canadian sport system, research shows that strategic understanding of, and managing by, values can lead to increased organizational performance. 
To engrain this wave of success and popularity of women’s sport into the fabric of our sport ecosystem, sport managers must embrace what is at the core of this success: the values women’s professional sport organizations hold, and the values consumers see within sport products such as on-field or court performance, merchandise and brand.
A report on the business of women’s sports by the Sports Innovation Lab, a market research firm, found that consumers are looking for different connection points in comparison to consumers of men’s sport. 

Women’s sport fans are looking for connection, excitement and to become  a part of a movement. The WNBA, for example, reflects core values of connection, social justice and excitement by strategically engaging with their basketball community.
As the PWHL and its affiliate teams continue their journey, and a WNBA franchise makes its way to Toronto, we must look to our women’s sport ecosystem and the economic and social values created by them.
Anyone who works within or leads a sport organization needs to truly know who they are serving, and authentically and effectively collaborate with stakeholders to bring those values to life.
Community and collaboration
To achieve and maintain success in women’s sports, embracing the concept of communities of practice is essential. Communities of practice refer to groups that share and work toward common interests, goals and values.
Research shows that having space where sport leaders and organizations can share knowledge, discuss triumphs and roadblocks and explore new ideas fosters long-term sustainability and innovation. However, the full potential of these tools is rarely leveraged strategically in sport.
In today’s sport ecosystem, there is potential for creating like-minded communities that value and uplift the increasing presence of professional girls’ and women’s sports.
The work of organizations such as Canadian Women & Sport, Canadian Tire JumpStart and the WISE Fund demonstrate the power of working together in a space that enhances collective excellence. 

These are networks of folks with similar values and vision for where women’s sport can and should be. There are for-profit entities like FanDuel, RBC Canada and Canadian Tire, who have also provided financial resources and support to power this movement forward. Within the community of practice, these organizations need to also authentically hire and train women for senior leadership positions.  
The PWHL and WNBA franchise in Toronto must not lose sight of the communities driving the excitement and support for these women’s sport leagues and teams.
Although the PWHL, WNBA — and, in 2025, a Canadian women’s pro soccer league called the Northern Super League — represent different sports, the strategic use of knowledge across sports, women’s sport value and collective resources can result in sustained and untapped excellence. There is potential for collaboration that is unmatched in the history of sport.
The future looks bright
Women’s sport is here to stay, and its future looks bright. To embrace and maintain the success of leagues and franchises, sport managers must not forget what women’s sport means to its core stakeholders — the fans — who are looking for connection and belonging, and the foundation from which it has grown. 
Those who work and lead in sport must understand the values that underpin women’s sport and manage those values authentically and strategically. This will ensure women’s sports in Toronto continue to resonate with fans and participants alike by embracing the example created with fans in the WNBA.
And finally, sport managers must embrace the value of collaboration and engage in communities of practice. The core of these values brings people, leagues and organizations together in the pursuit of excellence, rather than pushing them apart.

Why are organisational cover-ups so common?,https://theconversation.com/why-are-organisational-cover-ups-so-common-230998,3024934,"Management, Hillsborough disaster, Grenfell Tower, Horizon, Educate me, Post Office Scandal, Infected blood inquiry","
The TV dramatisation of the UK Horizon Post Office scandal evoked outrage and disbelief. However, as another example of dysfunctional organisational behaviour, it was expected rather than exceptional. 
The Post Office saga joins a long list of cover-ups or scandals that includes Hillsborough, Enron, Grenfell, the infected blood scandal, the Tuam babies scandal in the Republic of Ireland, Boeing 737 Max and Nasa (Columbia space shuttle). They represent what happens when there is a move within organisations and institutions to cover up the causes of a tragedy. 
The corporate drive to hide the truth is not random, but, I would say, inevitable. So why does it happen and why is it likely to keep happening?
Charlie Chaplin’s iconic movie Modern Times depicts humans as cogs in the wheel. The movie skewered scientific management of work movements (for example, that of engineer and author Frederick Taylor), which argued that work must be scientifically analysed to optimise efficiency. Taylor’s theory stresses that employees should be assigned to perform one specific task, with scientific methods finding the single best way to perform that task. Managers directly supervise employees and employees are paid based on their performance.   





The Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution contributed to a desire to apply scientific management to the organisation of work. Taylorism fed directly into our treatment of factory workers as elements in the workflow that needed to be monitored and controlled. 
The ghost of Taylorism is evident in our increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to replace human labour. Chaplin understood that the machine metaphor was more than just better technology, it was a kind of template for how people ought to behave. 
Stories about scandals vilify the people involved – ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells is the most recent example. Individuals do carry responsibility, but blaming bad leaders is easier than accepting that institutions and governments are culpable. 
My field (organisational behaviour) has contributed to this problem by being servants to industry. The mantra to measure, quantify and modify adds a sliver of scientific respectability to the fields of business and management. But it can lead to a blind spot around how organisational systems can evolve to damage people. Executive behaviour in the Enron, Boeing and the UK Post office scandals were motivated by “good” business principles – protecting the company. Protecting institutions can seem ethical.   
But organisational scandals are a reminder of what happens when efficiency is championed over personal experiences, and dysfunctional systems are defended. The Horizon Post Office scandal highlighted the worst elements of the scientific management culture in the “efficient” way that the sub-postmasters were hounded.
It was also evident in the delay in getting to the truth because no one would admit that the technology could be wrong. This approach is nothing new. Initially, fans were blamed for Hillsborough, and pilots for the problems with Boeing 737 Max.
Can organisations change?
In these scandals, the institutions and corporations skilfully control the narrative until their bubble of lies or incomplete accounts bursts. Enforced transparency and a fair playing field could break this pattern. A Hillsborough law, introducing a legally enforceable “duty of candour” for police and public authorities in investigations, and equal legal funding for bereaved families at inquiries and inquests, would be one way to avoid the David versus Goliath journey. 
The absence of convictions or meaningful repercussions following almost all scandals is abysmal. Restorative justice has a role to play, but wilfully perverting the course of public justice needs to be sanctioned.
We can’t depend on leaders to do the right thing if we keep educating them to put their mission first and people second. We promote and hire on the basis that leaders put their organisations first. The overused explanation of a “bad” culture being responsible for dysfunctional organisations simply means that everybody clearly understood the real vision and objectives, and committed to doing what was needed. 
Organisations frequently don’t want to talk about failures or even apparently to learn from them (we can take the Columbia space shuttle and 737 Boeing Max tragedies as examples of this). Similarly, employee silence is common and whistleblowing rare. The DNA of business education is flawed, with ethics and social justice seen as peripheral issues.

We need to start by accepting that organisations will do anything to maximise profit and shareholder value, and reverse-engineer from this point. 
For example, accepting that accidents are likely can protect people from organisational dysfunction. Commercial air travel is one of the safest industries in the world, and the success is based on the fact that plane crashes are impossible to hide. Aviation (like nuclear power operations and chemical industries) are called high-reliability organisations (HROs), which function nearly error-free in extremely challenging and uncertain environments. 
The key to HROs is that procedures to protect people are mandatory and strictly enforced by experts. They start from the perspective that accidents are very likely if systems are not in place to prevent them. 
Imagine how different the Horizon scandal might have been if the Post Office invited sub-postmasters to collaborate in monitoring the new system for potential flaws when it was introduced. 
We don’t need a team of management consultants and policy advisers to understand that new work procedures might not begin perfectly. The biggest lie at the centre of most organisational failures – the Horizon Post Office scandal included – is that something unexpected and unpredictable happened.

Henry Moore in Miniature shows the brutal influence of wartime on the sculptorâs work,https://theconversation.com/henry-moore-in-miniature-shows-the-brutal-influence-of-wartime-on-the-sculptors-work-230464,3024933,"Art, Sculpture, Gallery, Exhibition, Artist, WW2, Give me perspective, Sculptor","
Several themes are explored in the touring exhibition Henry Moore in Miniature, currently on show at the Holburne Museum, Bath, but the standout is the impact of war on Moore’s work. 
The English sculptor, active from the 1940s to the 1980s, was best known for his monumental bronze sculptures. This exhibition displays more than 60 of Moore’s maquettes – small models created to plan a larger piece of sculpture.
Later in his career, as Europe descended into yet another war, Moore completed Three Points (1939-1940), made from cast iron. The sculpture has surrealist characteristics and although Moore never saw himself as part of the surrealist movement, he was excited by its impact on contemporary art.

Moore said of this sculpture: “This pointing has an emotional or physical action in it where things are just about to touch but don’t … like the points in the sparking plug of a car … the spark has to jump across the gap.” However, for me, this sculpture has distinctly threatening connotations, emblematic of a time of high anxiety throughout Europe.






The start of the second world war left Moore questioning his role in the impending conflict. Sir Kenneth Clarke, then-director of the National Gallery (1934-1945) and a lifelong supporter of Moore, appointed him as a war artist. The sculptor was immediately drawn to the subterranean human landscape he had witnessed on the London Underground, where Londoners sheltered from the Blitz.
Moore made a point of never making direct observational drawings from those sleeping in the underground tunnels – but he did capture their plight in a series of memorable drawings completed when returning to his studio. It’s thought Moore made a series of maquettes as a way of recalling these intimate scenes of survival. His “Sleeping Shelterers” drawings may have been based on these maquettes.

These maquettes stimulated Moore’s Madonna and Child series from 1943, and were created as part of his work on a public sculpture now located inside St Matthew’s Parish Church in Northampton. But they also have an uncanny resemblance to some of his Sleeping Shelterer drawings. 
The Madonna and Child commissioned for Claydon Church in Suffolk commemorated local men killed during the second world war. These sculptures are generally seen as the advent of a new sense of realism in Moore’s work, again prompted by his studies of people sheltering in the London Underground. 
In 1944, Moore made another series of terracotta modelled maquettes. This time,  a male figure is also part of the family unit. The parent figures in the Family Group (1949) studies of this period are protective of the infant. This possibly alludes to the reunification of families after the war.
The exhibition cites these later works as part of the “values of the newly invigorated Welfare State”. These intimately modelled scenes also illustrate Moore’s fascination with how clothing wraps and protects the human form. His focus on drapery was expanded upon in later sculptures, drawings and tapestries.

Moore’s Helmet Heads series of artworks are represented in the exhibition through three memorable sculptures. Although Moore started the series in 1939, he returned to the theme in the 1950s at a time of global anxiety and the fracturing of global unions that had successfully extinguished Nazi Germany. 
Moore became a founder member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament at the same time the US, Soviet Union and UK achieved the destructive power of nuclear weapons. These maquettes are cast in lead, which was used as a protective material against radiation while at the same time being a highly poisonous substance. In the Helmet Head sculptures, instead of the protective arms of Madonna and Child 1943 which were cast in bronze, lead is used as a dual metaphor for protection and death.
The post war maquettes of 1950-52 shown in this exhibition suggest a pessimistic view of the state of humanity. These artworks are sinewy, emaciated and dystopian embers of what has been leftover from the destructive powers of war – and potential nuclear technology of the future. 
They also demonstrate the lasting impact of surrealism on Moore’s work. Left as brutally unfinished bronzes with jagged edges and exposed seams from the bronze casting process, they suggest disunity, or a fracturing of the human condition. 
Moving through the exhibition, Moore’s appreciation of Mycenaean art asserts itself in the series of maquettes called Reclining Warrior (1953) and Maquette for Fallen Warrior (1956), both cast in bronze. Although Moore had long been influenced by Greek sculpture, it wasn’t until his exhibition in Athens in 1951 that he fully appreciated its impact on his work. 
In Maquette for Fallen Warrior, we witness the agonising contortions of death as a soldier takes their last breath. It’s a brutal testimony to the human cost of war.

Why using dating apps for public health messaging is an ethical dilemma,https://theconversation.com/why-using-dating-apps-for-public-health-messaging-is-an-ethical-dilemma-230457,3024932,"Public health, STIs, Sexual health, Public health campaigns, Tinder, Grindr, Dating apps, Match, Keep me on trend","
Dating apps are not just about finding love or hooking up. They’re becoming increasingly important in the communication of public health messaging, particularly sexual health. 
In 2023, Harvard Public Health magazine suggested that dating apps could “become a key component in [sexually infectious diseases] prevention”. And their prediction seems to be spot on. Grindr, a dating app popular among men who have sex with men, for example, has recently partnered with MPOWER in Ireland and The Love Tank in London to allow users to order HIV test kits through the app. While these partnerships hold promise for public health, they also raise important ethical challenges. Alongside colleagues from the UK and US, we have published a discussion of these challenges and proposed ways of addressing them. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, more people than ever started using dating apps. Today, apps such as Tinder, Match, or Grindr have millions of users worldwide. A recent Pew survey in the US showed that more than half of people aged under 30 had used dating apps. Most dating apps can be accessed from smartphones, allowing users to find other people based on shared interests, preferences or location. 

A recent systematic review concluded that apps have multiple benefits for public health, including the ability to effectively target specific groups. In the US, Building Healthy Online Communities is a successful example of collaborating with dating apps to promote sexual health. And, during the recent monkeypox (mpox) outbreak, Grindr provided information about the virus and its vaccine to users.





Profit, privacy and prejudice
But most apps are profit-generators for businesses and operate in ethical and regulatory contexts that are very different to those of medical or health related professions. One major concern is privacy, as apps collect vast amounts of personal data. Cybersecurity experts have argued that apps are a “security and privacy minefield”. This is, in part, because the main goal of apps is “generating, capturing and controlling user data” for profit. 
Unfortunately, there are many examples of apps mishandling data. For example, Grindr has been fined for sharing sensitive user data with third parties, including users’ HIV status. This misuse of data can have severe consequences, including outing people in unsafe environments.

Dating apps can also reproduce the prejudices and discrimination all too common in wider society. Research shows that many users, particularly from marginalised groups, experience harassment, including racism and ableism, on these platforms. A 2019 study of the experiences of dating apps among rural sexual minority men in the US found that online dating often led to “deception, bullying or discrimination, and harassment or coercion”.
Some apps, such as Grindr, have removed the option for users to filter according to race – but other apps are designed with features which allow, if not encourage, discrimination. Discriminatory experiences undermine users’ trust in dating apps, making marginalised groups more reluctant to use them. This also means that marginalised groups may be less likely to access public  health information and help through dating apps. 
Some dating apps operate with opaque policies. For example, Grindr and Tinder can terminate any user’s account, for any reason and without any notice. Some public health organisations who had been using apps to disseminate information have had their profiles blocked on some apps.

Future collaborations with apps should prioritise the benefit of users over those of the app businesses, develop transparent data policies that prevent users’ data from being shared for profit, ensure the apps’ commitment to anti-discrimination and anti-harrassment, and provide links to health and wellbeing services beyond the apps.
Dating apps have the potential to be powerful allies in public health, especially in reaching populations that have often been ignored. However, their use must be carefully managed to avoid compromising user privacy, safety and marginalisation.

Zombie fires in the Arctic smoulder underground and refuse to die ,https://theconversation.com/zombie-fires-in-the-arctic-smoulder-underground-and-refuse-to-die-whats-causing-them-221945,3024931,"Climate change, Arctic, Climate science, Wildfires, Arctic warming, Tundra, Educate me, zombie fires","
So-called “zombie fires” in the peatlands of Alaska, Canada and Siberia disappear from the Earth’s surface and smoulder underground during the winter before coming back to life the following spring. These fires puzzle scientists because they appear in early May, way ahead of the usual fire season in the far north, and can reignite for a number of years. 
Most scientists believe that zombie fires are the remnants of fires on the surface, but we have identified an alternative cause. Our research suggests that rapid atmospheric warming above ground can cause peat soils to suddenly heat up to smouldering temperatures underground, all without any spark or other ignition. These zombie fires may be a case of climate change-driven spontaneous combustion.
Reports of such fires date back to 1940s, when they were rare events. However, the frequency and intensity of these fires has increased significantly in the past two decades, hand in hand with accelerated warming in the Arctic, the fastest-warming region on the planet.
At the start of 2024, more than 100 zombie fires were active in the Canadian province of British Columbia alone. Zombie fires have even been recorded near the coldest village on earth, Oymyakon in north eastern Siberia, where they carried over through multiple winters and account for around 3.5% of area burned  in the wider region each year. 






More carbon is trapped in temperature-sensitive Arctic peat soils than is found in the entire atmosphere, and these fires are releasing gigatonnes of it into the atmosphere. We wanted to know if sudden warming might be directly responsible.
Two remarkable results
We developed a mathematical model to explore different what-if scenarios, including how the temperature and carbon content of peat soils respond to changes in the weather and climate. Crucially, our model captures how certain microbes generate heat while breaking down soil and releasing its carbon into the atmosphere.
We obtained two remarkable results:
The first is that those microbes can generate so much heat that underground peat can smoulder at around 80°C over the winter, ready to ignite in spring. And this can happen without there ever having been a fire in that spot above ground, and without the weather above ground reaching the sorts of temperatures that would normally be needed for soil to burn.
We call this new state the hot metastable state of peat soils. In this context, “metastable” means a long burn – the hot state lasts for a long but finite time, up to ten years, until the peat burns out.
Our other key finding is that a sudden transition from the regular cold state to the hot metastable state can be triggered by realistic climate patterns alone, including summer heat waves and global warming scenarios. Most interestingly, the increase in the atmospheric temperature has to be faster than some critical rate to trigger the transition. If the atmospheric temperature increases by the same amount, but at a slower rate, bioactive peat soil remains in the regular cold state and never transitions to the hot metastable state.
We still do not have proof this happening in the real world, and it hasn’t been demonstrated in a lab – for now, this is a phenomenon seen only in our models. But we do know that compost (very similar to peat) can catch fire in the same way. For instance a large fire on the outskirts of London during a heatwave in 2022 was probably caused by a pile of compost spontaneously combusting.
All this suggests that atmospheric temperature is not actually the key critical factor for zombie fires. Rather, it is the rate of atmospheric warming that triggers long burns of underground peat. Put simply, it is not the heat, it is the rate.
How to fight the zombies
As the climate warms, the weather is becoming more extreme, and these are precisely the conditions that can lead to more and more zombie fires. This is concerning as it could kick off a vicious cycle: the gigatonnes of carbon released from ancient peat soils into the atmosphere are likely to make the climatic changes even worse, which means more fires, so more extreme weather, and so on.
Indeed, zombie fires are an example of a rate-induced tipping point, where a system fails to adapt to too-fast changes in external conditions and transitions from its regular state to a different, often undesired state. It is possible that the contemporary climate is approaching – or has already exceeded – dangerous rates of change for certain natural system, such as bioactive peat soils, which could explain the recent increase in zombie fires. 
It appears that the only solution to prevent further zombie fires is to limit climate variability. While policy makers focus on dangerous levels of atmospheric temperature (the heat), climate variability (the rate of change) could be equally or even more relevant to our resilience in the short term.

From health to sports â ears can say a lot about you,https://theconversation.com/from-health-to-sports-ears-can-say-a-lot-about-you-228756,3024930,"Health, gout, Ears, Educate me","
An ear is like an iceberg – much of it is out of sight. The only visible part is the auricle – the seashell shaped structure made of bendy cartilage, covered in skin. Its main role is to act as a trumpet, filtering and funnelling sound waves down into the middle, then the inner ear, where they are converted into our sense of hearing. 
A medical ear examination usually involves an inspection of the canal, using an instrument called an otoscope. This is usually to investigate more common ear conditions – an infection, or a clog of wax. 
But the auricle – also known as the external ear – can also tell tales about your health, family traits and even whether you play high contact sports.  
The shape of every ear is unique as a fingerprint and each part has a name. The fleshy, dangly bit at the bottom is the lobule – or ear lobe. The folded top portion, which curves along the edge of the ear, is the helix – named for its shape – and the two prominent areas that sit next to the canal are the tragus and antitragus. 






The word “tragus” is derived from the Greek for goat. This is because the tragus is usually covered in hairs, giving it a similar appearance to a billygoat’s chin. Have a feel for yourself – you may not have realised the hairs were there.
Ear genetics
Earlobes feel different to the rest of the ear. They lack cartilage so feel soft and squishy, rather than firm and bendy. 
But the appearance of the earlobe can vary according to your genes – they’re either free (with a dangly bit) or attached (attached directly to the head). 
It was initially believed that the allele – a form of a gene – that codes for free lobes is dominant, which means that you only have to have one copy of the gene, either from your mother or your father. Attached lobes were understood to come from recessive alleles, which means that you must inherit them from both parents. That made free lobes more common. 
But we now know it’s not that straightforward. A spectrum exists between free and attached lobes, coded by many different genes. Take a look at your own lobes, the people you live with, and some people in the public eye. They range in size and shape – from Charlize Theron and her free earlobes to Gwyneth Paltrow’s attached lobules. 
Also, wearing heavy earrings can elongate lobes and alter their appearance, too. 


Earlobes are rich with sensory nerve fibres, which gives them a reputation for being an erogenous zone – sensitive to touch, breath and nibbles.
Gout and tophi
Gout is on the rise. Not just a disease of the Georgian aristocracy, it is a systemic condition that can affect the joints, heart, kidneys – and even ears. 
It’s caused by high levels of uric acid in the bloodstream, which turns into crystals. If these accumulate in the joints, they can inflame and erode them, causing painful swelling. High uric acid is also associated with higher levels of “bad” cholesterol, and is  associated with cardiovascular diseases, such as high blood pressure and strokes. 
Occasionally, uric acid crystals can develop under the skin. These can appear as little lumps called tophi, that often form in the tissue around joints, but also in the ears. 
Tophi are firm and look like pebbles, which is where they get their name from (the singular tophus is Latin for stone). If tophi break through the skin, or are removed surgically, they usually look like chalk.
Tophi usually form over long periods of time, and are only ever associated with gout.
Cauliflower ear
Stuck out on the sides of our heads, in various degrees of protrusion, our ears are exposed and potentially open to damage. Earrings can easily tear through piercings if they get caught. Ears are often subjected to trauma during fights and sports. 
Boxer Mike Tyson even bit off a section of opponent Evander Holyfield’s ear during a match, for instance.
One of the most unmistakable traumatic conditions is cauliflower ear, also known as wrestler’s ear or boxer’s ear. Its medical name is subperichondrial haematoma – a technical term to describe the build up of blood around the ear’s cartilage as a result of mechanical damage, such as a direct blow to the ear. 

The problem is more severe than it might seem. The damage to the vessels, and the pressure of the accumulated blood, can deprive the cartilage of oxygen causing it to degenerate. The body’s response is to produce a mass of lumpy connective tissue – and a “cauliflower” ear forms. 
Cauliflower ears can be prevented by avoiding sports most associated with the condition, such as rugby, wrestling and martial arts. For those who love contact sports, protective headwear or a scrum cap can help protect the ears. If a haematoma does occur, it’s important to get it aspirated with a needle to protect the cartilage from harm. 
The external, visible parts of our ears, then, are more than just decorative. Their functions range from transmission of sound waves to sexual arousal. And changes in appearance can reflect the sports we like to play to the style of jewellery we prefer.

Digital campaigning is a huge part of elections now â but going viral isnât everything,https://theconversation.com/digital-campaigning-is-a-huge-part-of-elections-now-but-going-viral-isnt-everything-230808,3024929,"Keep me on trend, UK election 2024, general election","
The election has commenced and the race is on – to amass as many likes, shares and comments as possible. Digital campaigning, particularly through social media, is now a key part of political candidates’ communication toolkit.
In fact, every general election campaign since 1997 has at some point been lauded as the first to make effective use of digital campaigning. But it was in 2015 that David Cameron’s campaign first made strategic use of social media to drive an election victory. 
As political reporter Tim Ross outlines in his excellent book, Why the Tories Won, Cameron’s team used a playbook developed by Barack Obama’s 2008 US presidential campaign. With the help of Obama’s digital guru Jim Messina, the Conservatives used targeted Facebook advertising to reach voters in key seats and secure an unexpected victory.

Over the coming weeks, we’ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we’ll fact check the claims being made. Sign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.






In the 2019 general election, Boris Johnson’s team swamped Facebook with messages every 15 minutes about the need to “Get Brexit Done”. They not only wanted to mobilise their existing supporters but to get them to share posts with persuadable, undecided voters.
When supporters share content with their own networks, messaging can reach supporters of other parties, or other “floating” voters. One digital campaigner I interviewed about the 2019 UK general election said:

My favourite shares are the ones that say: ‘I don’t normally agree with Corbyn or Labour or Momentum – but I agree with this.’ Then you’ve reached someone, and they’re showing that content to people who presumably feel the same way.

But the evidence is mixed on just how effective such campaigning is at reaching and persuading voters. A study conducted during the 2010 US midterm elections found unmistakable evidence that seeing political communication on a friend’s social media page directly influenced voters’ behaviour. The study found that not just those users who were directly targeted were affected, but also their friends, and friends of friends. 
This echoed decades-old findings on two-step communication theory, which explains how information flows from the media to opinion leaders, and then to the wider public. But more recently, a consensus has emerged that the persuasive effects of political advertising are, on average, small.
In 2016, researchers conducted randomised experiments on 34,000 people’s voting preferences during the US presidential election. They found that any political advert’s persuasive effect on voters was small but detectable. 
The pitfalls of digital campaigning
Campaigners want voters to be exposed to repeated and consistent key messages. This tactic, sometimes referred to as “water dripping on stone”, has been used by digital election consultants Topham Guerin on several successful campaigns – including for the Conservatives in 2019. 

Both main parties have already launched digital campaigns on TikTok, and begun rolling out attack memes. New spending limits mean parties are likely to spend even more money creating content tailored to each platform.
X (formerly Twitter) is regarded by the main parties as of little importance beyond influencing journalists who are hopelessly addicted to it. But Facebook still has reach with older voters, a key demographic for the Conservatives, and Instagram and TikTok will be essential to reaching younger voters. 
Other platforms like streaming platform Twitch, as well as relationships with influencers, are also likely to be evident in this campaign. 
Parties will also be hoping that content generated by voters, such as memes and shortform videos, may help their cause – or at least, hurt their opponents. Peer-to-peer platforms such as WhatsApp will be especially important here, but are also difficult to monitor for disinformation. 

Political parties themselves also risk falling victim to the belief that social media is everything. While the power of the press is no longer what it once was, there are still moments when broadcasters and newspapers can set the agenda, such as during the televised debates. And while younger people may be more prolific users of social media, they are also the demographic least likely to vote. 
In the 2017 and 2019 election campaigns, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party demonstrated its prowess in digital communication, using videos and memes to amass millions of views. However, in 2019, the party had its worst result since the 1930s. Online popularity does not always match up with voters’ actual views. 
After the 2019 election, a comprehensive report commissioned by the party from the thinktank Labour Together heavily criticised its digital approach. The report said Labour’s supporters online “spent too much of the campaign talking to themselves rather than reaching out to convince swing voters”.
As political scientist Andrew Chadwick has argued, influence flows from mainstream media via social media to parties, activists and supporters and back again. It is a constantly changing landscape, and campaigners should not overestimate the importance of going viral. 
The central lesson from 2019 will be not to believe the hype. Success on social media won’t mean a thing, unless it’s matched with real-world activity that persuades voters to go out and support you on election day.

Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel are becoming increasingly isolated internationally â they need to listen to their friends,https://theconversation.com/benjamin-netanyahu-and-israel-are-becoming-increasingly-isolated-internationally-they-need-to-listen-to-their-friends-231105,3024928,"United Nations, Joe Biden, Gaza, Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, Give me perspective, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Gaza war","
Pressure, both external and internal, is rapidly changing the international landscape for Israel. In 2011, Ehud Barak, then Israel’s defence minister, warned that Israel would face a “diplomatic-political tsunami” of international isolation and censure if it could not resolve the conflict with the Palestinians. More than a decade later, that wave has held off, but the current is moving swiftly in that direction.
In less than a week, three major moves occurred that would have been unthinkable prior to the Gaza War. First, on Monday May 20, the Office of the Prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (ICC) sought warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the defense minister, Yoav Gallant, for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor, Karim Khan KC, also sought warrants for three Hamas leaders for atrocities committed during and after October 7.
Two days later the governments of Norway, Spain, and Ireland announced that they would recognise Palestinian statehood on May 28. While more than 140 countries in the United Nations already recognise Palestine as a state, most western European countries maintain that statehood should only be declared through a process of negotiations between Israel and Palestinians, rather than unilaterally. Though largely symbolic, the three states maintained that the move was necessary to preserve any chance of ever reaching a two-state solution.
Then, on Friday May 24, the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel must halt the current military operation in Rafah. It also ordered Israel to open the Rafah border crossing with Egypt to allow for the entry of  humanitarian aid and ensure access to Gaza for investigators and fact-finding missions. 





The ruling is part of a broader case brought to the court by South Africa alleging that Israel’s actions in Gaza amount to genocide – an allegation that Israel denies, and which was not decided in this ruling. The decision is considered legally binding, but is unenforceable without action from the UN Security Council, where the  US typically exercises its veto in measures relating to Israel.
This comes alongside widespread grassroots activism that has only increased as the war has continued. Weekly demonstrations have persisted in London and other cities around the world, and a wave of protests have rocked college campuses across the United States and Europe.
Even within Israel, protests have intensified in support of a ceasefire to release the hostages still held by Hamas, despite most Israelis still supporting the war itself. There has also been increasing criticism of Netanyahu and his failure to articulate a “day after” strategy for Gaza, including from within his own war cabinet.
Digging in
In the short term, the heightened international pressure will likely produce a domestic “circle-the-wagons” effect and mute much of the internal criticism of Netanyahu. Israeli officials were quick to reject the ICJ ruling, and Netanyahu called the ICC warrants a “moral outrage”. Netanyahu has been clear that Israel will keep fighting until its aims are met. 

Indeed, just two days after the ICJ ruling, Israel carried out an airstrike reportedly targeting senior Hamas militants that killed at least 45 people in a tent camp in Rafah.
The series of international moves is also likely to produce a doubling down of support for Israel from the Biden administration. Biden has struggled to find a middle ground between supporting Israel’s right to defend itself against Hamas, while disagreeing with Israel’s tactical choices and strategic direction. Indeed, the US president personally criticised the ICC warrants as “outrageous”, and Democrats may join Republicans in seeking sanctions against the ICC. 
The White House has also been silent on the ICJ ruling. Administration officials have said that the Rafah operation has not yet crossed Biden’s red lines.
The one area where we may see a change is in the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Both the ICC and ICJ rulings focus largely on this element, and ensuring humanitarian aid reaches civilians in Gaza has also been a major priority for the Biden administration in its discussions with Netanyahu regarding the Rafah offensive. 
Israel and Egypt have blamed each other for the cessation of aid into Rafah in recent weeks following Israel’s seizure of the Gaza side of the border. But the rulings will pressure both parties to reach an agreement to reopen the crossing, and the US is already coordinating with Egypt to find work-arounds in the meantime.
Shifting tide
The latest events point to a shifting tide in how the world views the Israel-Palestine conflict more broadly. They indicate that states and international bodies are less willing to cede all leverage on the direction of the conflict to Washington.
The short-term response of Israel – and the US – will undoubtedly be to resist these trends. Israel has often claimed that the UN is biased against it. It does so with some justification – from 2015 and 2022, there were 140 UN General Assembly resolutions adopted against Israel, compared to just 60 against all other countries combined. So Israel will view last week as one of increasing isolation, and the immediate reaction will be to push back at the rulings and go it alone.
But the recent moves by international courts and governments do not equate to an abandonment of Israel or, crucially, an endorsement of Hamas. On the contrary (despite the rhetoric at some protests), the majority of the international community wants to see a secure Israeli state alongside a Palestinian state. But they worry that the Gaza War is diminishing that possibility, pushing the conflict towards even further entrenchment and emboldening extreme positions on both sides.
The atrocities of October 7 understandably nullified the idea of a two-state solution for many Israelis in the near future. But when the war eventually ends, Israel – and Palestinians – will have a choice if they will work with or against a growing international consensus in seeking a resolution to the conflict. 
When that time comes, Israel is likely to find an open hand from global partners in steering the conflict towards a pragmatic resolution with regional and international legitimacy.

Fears that English is âdisappearingâ in England are misplaced â history shows the island has always been multilingual,https://theconversation.com/fears-that-english-is-disappearing-in-england-are-misplaced-history-shows-the-island-has-always-been-multilingual-230474,3024778,"History, Language, Britain, Linguistics, British history, History of language, Educate me","
A common lament among those opposed to immigration is that “in many parts of England, you don’t hear English spoken any more”. But it has never been the case that English was the only language spoken on this island. 
Old English, the earliest ancestor of the modern English language, was a relative newcomer to Britain. Its speakers, the Anglo-Saxons, came from different regions across what is now northern Germany to an island where many Celtic languages were spoken alongside Latin – a legacy of southern Britain’s time as a Roman colony. The Old English language was initially joined by other Germanic languages including Old Norse and Frisian. 
The Norman Conquest brought speakers of the Romance language Norman French to Britain. They had such an impact on the English language that it shifted to a new stage of development known as Middle English.
No written texts in Britain survive from before the arrival of the Romans. But we know from other historical and archaeological sources that the island was inhabited since the Palaeolithic period, and that people had settled here permanently since the end of the last Ice Age, around 9,000 years ago. 





By the Iron Age (circa BCE 800), Britain’s inhabitants were speaking a language known as Proto-Celtic or Common Celtic. By 43AD, when southern Britain became a Roman colony under emperor Claudius, the island was populated by speakers of several Celtic languages. These fell into two sub-groups: the Brythonic languages British (ancestor of modern Welsh and Cornish) and the now-extinct Pictish, and the Goidelic Gaelic (ancestor of modern Irish Gaelic and Scottish Gaelic).

The Romans brought the Latin language and alphabet with them, as well as (eventually) Christianity. All of these had a significant influence on Britain’s history. With the Latin alphabet came written literary culture, which persisted alongside the spoken Latin language after Britain ceased to be a Roman colony. 
The close ties between Latin and Christianity can be seen in the Welsh words that were borrowed from Latin, such as llyfr (book, from the Latin liber), ysgol (school, from the Latin schola) and eglwys (church, from the Latin ecclesia).
Impact of Germanic migration
When the Anglo-Saxons came to Britain during the 5th and 6th centuries, it was already a multilingual island in which several Celtic languages and Latin were spoken. The language the Anglo-Saxons spoke after their arrival, Old English, belongs to the Germanic language family, and it too was quickly influenced by Latin as these pagan people converted to Christianity. 
As with Welsh, Latin influence can be seen in Old English borrowings such as win (wine, from the Latin vinum), cros (cross, from the Latin crux) and mæsse (mass, from the Latin missa). 

From the late 8th century, groups of Scandinavian raiders who spoke a different Germanic language (Old Norse) and have come to be known collectively as Vikings were also a significant presence in Britain. After they transitioned from raiding to settlement, the presence of Old Norse speakers in Britain altered both the grammar and vocabulary of Old English. Many common English words such as kid, stench, egg, yard, skirt, anger, fight, law and knife were originally borrowed from Old Norse.
These were not the only languages present in early medieval Britain. Speakers of the Germanic Frisian language, who came from a region that now includes the coast of the Netherlands and north-western Germany, formed a significant community in pre-Norman Britain. They were widely recognised as merchants, traders and sailors. 
Greek, Hebrew and Latin were revered by early medieval Christians as the “three sacred languages”. While there were no Jewish communities in Anglo-Saxon England, a scholarly knowledge of Hebrew did exist. Greek held a prominent place in the religious and intellectual culture of early Anglo-Saxon England, thanks in large part to the efforts of two scholars, Theodore and Hadrian, who founded an important school at Canterbury in the 7th century.
After the Norman Conquest, Britain’s multilingual culture expanded, including Norman French, Middle English, Latin, Welsh, Cornish, Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Flemish. The political consequences of the Norman Conquest meant that Norman French (which would eventually develop into its own dialect, known as Anglo-Norman) became the de facto language of commerce, government and politics. This in turn led to some interesting class implications.
While the Old Norse borrowings noted above have become “homely” words in modern English, their Norman French equivalents have come to signify upper-class versions of the same concept. Consider the resonances of kid/heir, stench/odour, egg/omelette, yard/court, skirt/costume, anger/cruelty, fight/battle, law/parliament or knife/armour. 
Britain has always been a place where many languages were not just spoken simultaneously, but interacted with one another. The modern English we speak today was shaped by these interactions.

Pro-Russian breakaway region Transnistria shows limits of domino theory in international relations,https://theconversation.com/pro-russian-breakaway-region-transnistria-shows-limits-of-domino-theory-in-international-relations-230143,3024687,"International relations, Cold War, Geopolitics, Transnistria, The Conversation France, Russia-Ukraine, Ukraine invasion 2022","
On 28 February, the leader of Moldova’s breakaway region of Transnistria, Vadim Krasnoselski, held the Seventh Congress of Deputies to discuss the implications of Moldova’s latest customs duties on Transnistrian businesses. His calls for Russia’s protection in response to Moldova’s “economic strangulation” sparked fear in many international observers of an imminent integration of the region into Russia, and even of a new frontline in Russia’s war against Ukraine.
Far from the international uproar, reactions on the domestic front were much more measured. Valeriu Pașa, president of one of the main think tanks in Chisinau, Watchdog, suggested that this Congress appeared more like a manoeuvre aimed at influencing public opinion. Meanwhile, in March Modolva’s vice-prime minister tasked with the mission of reintegrating Transnistria, Oleg Serebrian, sought to allay anxieties:

“Tiraspol is attempting to avoid positioning itself in any way, balancing itself acrobatically between Moscow, Kiev and Chisinau. What we can say with certainty is that Tiraspol does not want to be involved in this conflict. In particular the administration. The business environment, as well as the population, definitely does not favour war. I have not met anyone on the left bank who says they support the war,”

Undeniably, this perception was reinforced by Russian President Vladimir Putin’s omission of Transnistria in his State of the Union on the next day.
This contrast between fears of imminent escalation and relative calm on the ground raises crucial questions about our understanding and interpretation of the events at play. It highlights the limitations of the domino theory metaphor, often used to explain and anticipate conflict dynamics, but which can lead to analytical errors and misguided perspectives, especially in the context of the war in Ukraine.





What is the domino theory’s purpose?
Since February 2022, the hypothesis of the Ukrainian war’s expansion has resurfaced regularly: if Ukraine falls, other countries will inevitably become targets for Russia. None seems more likely than Moldova, a neighbouring neutral country whose president, Maia Sandu, has openly defied Russia since the beginning of the war in Ukraine.
In essence, the domino theory combines in its analysis the idea of contagion (the first fall triggering a chain reaction due to geographical proximity), a belief in regional stability (the fall of a key country can disrupt regional balance), and the perception of a particular influence (the spread of influence can attract supporters in other countries by offering an attractive alternative to existing systems). In geopolitical terms, the domino theory suggests that if a country or region falls under the influence of an ideology or regime, it could trigger a series of similar falls in neighbouring countries, much like dominoes falling one after another when pushed.
This approach, which drove US president Harry Truman (presidential term 1945-1953) to support governments in Greece and Turkey following the Second World War, was explicitly formulated in April 1954 by President Dwight Eisenhower (1953-1961) during a 1954 press conference commenting on the developments of the Indochina War:

“Finally, you have broader considerations that might follow what you would call the ‘falling domino’ principle. You have a row of dominoes set up, you knock over the first one, and what will happen to the last one is the certainty that it will go over very quickly. So you could have a beginning of a disintegration that would have the most profound influences.”

This perspective profoundly influenced US strategic thinking during the Cold War, undergoing several iterations. Recently, among others, Brandon Temple, a special warfare officer in the Air Force serving as a legislative liaison to the House of Representatives, and researcher Mark Episkopos have observed and lamented the return of these old strategic frameworks during the war in Ukraine.
When it comes to Transnistria, this pattern seems straightforward enough: the summoning of “deputies at all levels” mirrors the sequence observed at the start of the 2014 war, whereby the annexation of Crimea gave way to the declarations of independence of Donetsk and Luhansk. Russian president Vladimir Putin notably justified the invasion on the grounds of protecting the two latter pseudo-states.
Why doesn’t it apply to Transnistria?
If the Congress proceeded as planned, it’s obvious that the Transnistrian domino didn’t fall on this occasion. Therefore, it is worth pausing to consider the limits of this metaphor and observable developments in the Transnistrian conflict.
Indeed, since the early 1960s, domino theory has faced criticism for overlooking various parameters; metaphors shape our perceptions, reinforce biases, and sometimes mask complexity, thereby exposing their limitations. In his famous New York Times magazine article in April 1965, Hans Morgenthau, one of the founders of the classical realist school, opposed increasing US involvement in Vietnam for this reason.
Main critiques of this theory include insufficient consideration of internal factors, local political, economic, and social dynamics; the oversight that bilateral and multilateral relations between countries can play a crucial role in impacting events and perception; recognition that a country’s political, economic, and social institutions’ strength can determine its ability to resist external pressures and maintain stability; and that external actors’ intervention and influence can significantly impact event evolution. Finally, cultural and historical differences between countries can influence how ideas and events are perceived and interpreted.
Concretely, one must revert to the fundamentals of the specific conflict. Indeed, one might argue that the seven-point resolution adopted by Tiraspol in late February 2024 aims to empower the Kremlin to escalate against Moldova. It is precisely to combat such hybrid threats from Russia that the European Union launched a civilian partnership mission in the country in 2023. Today, there are numerous ways Moscow can influence political dynamics in Chisinau, especially during this presidential election year.
Despite similarities with the resumption of the Georgia (August 2008) and Ukraine (since February 2022) wars, there is one major difference here, namely, the absence of territorial continuity between Russia and Transnistria. The Russian Federation is neither in a position to control the border between Transnistria and Ukraine, nor to send arms to support a war effort, nor to take over from the troops present there (1,500 peacekeepers plus a few thousand local forces), whose military potential is otherwise limited. Neither Transnistria nor Moldova, which have not faced each other militarily for nearly 30 years, envisions an armed exit from this conflict, if only because neither wants their territories to become battlefields comparable to those of the Donbass.
In short, while Moldova might need European assistance more than ever to face up to threats of Russian destabilisation, we can’t be sure the resumption of the Transnistrian conflict is the most imminent risk. However, the situation would of course change radically if Russia were to make significant progress on Ukraine’s southern front, in the Odessa region; the city is only, after all, a hundred kilometres from Tiraspol.

Democracy in Africa: digital voting technology and social media can be a force for good ,https://theconversation.com/democracy-in-africa-digital-voting-technology-and-social-media-can-be-a-force-for-good-and-bad-229311,3024610,"Arab Spring, Democracy, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Africa, e-voting, Internet access, Zambia, Democracy in Africa, Voting machines, Peace and Security, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), voting techology, tech talk, Social media Africa","
It’s a bumper year for elections on the continent: by the end of 2024, 20 countries ought to have gone to the polls to vote in national elections. A handful of others are also scheduled to conduct local-level elections. As is the case elsewhere in the world, digital technologies have come to play a key role in African elections and political life more broadly – sometimes, but not always, in positive ways.
Maxwell Maseko researches digital governance and media. He recently published a book chapter examining the potential threats and benefits to democracy that digital technologies pose in African countries. He explains what he found.
Can African countries use digital technology to strengthen democracy?
In recent years, more people in African countries have been able to access the internet than ever before. This growth has been driven by improved telecommunication infrastructure and the rising adoption of mobile devices. 
At the same time there’s been a worrying democratic decline in some countries and regions, most markedly north Africa. This is marked by an increase in military regimes, a rise in violent conflicts and growing public dissatisfaction with political systems.





Today social media platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), WhatsApp and Facebook are regularly used for debate, and to mobilise citizens and organise protests.

      Social media mobilisation is a bright spot in Uganda's dark Bobi Wine saga




Examples include the 2010 Arab Spring in north African and Middle Eastern countries and South Africa’s #FeesMustFall protests beginning in 2015. 
During Zambia’s “bush protests” in 2020 a reported 500,000 people tuned in online to social media platforms to listen to their leaders criticise alleged government corruption.
That’s just one example of how digital technology can strengthen democracy by allowing citizens to get involved. Others include improving health and education services and strengthening tax and revenue collection methods.  
What kind of digital technologies can be used? And how?
Many African countries have weak election management systems. Citizens are rightly worried about human interference in electoral processes, as well as a lack of transparency and oversight.  
A study of India and some countries in the Americas and Europe suggests that digital technologies can be used to restore the credibility and integrity of elections. 
This approach is already being taken in some countries on the continent – mostly those like Kenya and South Africa, which are considered stronger democracies than their peers.
In its 2021 local government elections, South Africa piloted the use of Voter Management Devices to replace scanners. The machines were used to verify voters and address the issue of double voting.
There were, however, some hiccups in practice. Internet connection issues were reported on voting day. That left about 100,000 people unable to cast their vote. Despite this mishap – and recent concerns raised by members of parliament about the machines’ efficiency – the devices are expected to be used again in the 2024 national elections on 29 May.
Social media platforms are also well used by South Africa’s Independent Electoral Commission and various political parties to promote voter education and registration, political campaigning, and debate on key national issues. This is a good way to try to reach the country’s more than 45 million active internet users out of a population of over 60 million.
Kenya also views the adoption of technology as an important step in improving accountability, transparency and citizen participation in democratic processes previously tainted by controversy and mistrust. Today Kenyans use social media platforms like X, Facebook and Instagram to voice opinions about various issues. Politicians also use these platforms to campaign and mobilise supporters.
Its Integrated Electoral Management System includes technology for biometric voter registration and electronic voter identification.

Electronic voting (e-voting), however, is a long way from being a reality in African countries. According to the World Economic Forum, the benefits of e-voting include more efficient elections and a faster vote count. 
Elsewhere, Brazil, India, the US and Estonia have piloted e-voting.
In 2014, Namibia became the first African country to adopt electronic voting machines. Though the system was prone to technical glitches, the machines were used again in Namibia’s 2019 presidential elections.
What about government misuse?
In line with the democratic decline in some countries and regions that I mentioned earlier, we’ve seen a number of governments throttling their citizens’ internet access to prevent people from organising, mobilising or even discussing their grievances with their leaders.
Ethiopia, for instance, has since the early 2000s shut down the internet and on numerous occasions censored online material. Its government also uses the internet as a surveillance tool. Ethiopia’s Center for Advancement of Rights and Democracy says internet access remains unequal and expensive.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there were several internet shutdowns before the presidential elections in December 2018. But even when the internet is functioning, it’s not very accessible. In a country of over 70 million people, only 22.9% were connected at the beginning of 2023. This is due to limited infrastructure and high access costs.
What needs to change?
African leaders need to remember that an election is not always a sign of a healthy democracy, although it gives citizens a chance to choose and evaluate their leaders. A positive attitude towards technology will go some way towards strengthening democracy.
Attitude, of course, won’t be sufficient. Authorities must create social, political and economic conditions that are conducive to ensuring digital benefits reach everyone. This will require political will, skilled artisans with a general understanding of basic technology, proper information and communications technology infrastructure, affordable data and legislation.
That access and technology must then be put to work to introduce modern balloting methods.

TikTok activism: how queer Zimbabweans use social media to show love and fight hate,https://theconversation.com/tiktok-activism-how-queer-zimbabweans-use-social-media-to-show-love-and-fight-hate-229763,3024609,"Social media, Zimbabwe, Women and girls, TikTok, TikTok in Africa, Zimbabwe media, Homophobia in Africa, LGBTQI+, social media in Africa, Zimbabwe culture, Africa Queer, LGBTIQ Africa, TikTok trends, LGBTIQ+ Africa, Social media Africa","
In Zimbabwe, there is a long held public view that queerness is “unAfrican” and imported to Africa from the west. Even though numerous studies have proven this not to be true, reiterations of this lie by the state has led many to believe that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) people cannot be Zimbabwean.
Robert Mugabe, the country’s first president, was infamous for his homophobic rhetoric. He often compared gender and sexual minorities to pigs and dogs. Such homophobic utterances further reduced the spaces where LGBTIQ+ people could live and express themselves without fear.




      Read more:
      How young, queer Nigerians use Twitter to shape identity and fight homophobia




In Zimbabwe, same-sex sexual relations are prohibited and those suspected of engaging in same-sex intimacy can be fined or jailed for up to a year. As a result, queer love is often made fun of, despised or ignored and queer couples can’t openly show their love. 





With public spaces increasingly closed off, LGBTIQ+ people in Zimbabwe have been forced to find alternative avenues to express themselves and to forge communities. This has led to increased visibility in alternative online spaces. These spaces represent a powerful act of resistance, a way for queer Zimbabweans to claim their right to exist and express themselves.
As scholars of queer studies, we examine in our research how LGBTIQ+ Zimbabweans use social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok to imagine new ways of being visible.
For six months, we studied six TikTok accounts within a broader netnography, a research approach where online communities are studied. The six accounts represent diverse forms of queer embodiment. They characterise Zimbabwe’s ethnic, linguistic and class diversity. 
Our study focused on how content creators use TikTok for activism, challenging homophobia and defying long held ideas about identities. Their voices, amplified by TikTok, are important in rethinking queerness in this southern African country.
Social media for change
As with movements like #MeToo, LGBTIQ+ individuals have used digital technologies to organise and advocate for social change. Social media platforms have served as spaces for them to connect, share their stories, create communities, and push for their rights.
In Zimbabwe, queer individuals use social media to assert their belonging in the nation by combining the national flag with the LGBTIQ+ symbol of the rainbow flag, symbolising their identity and struggles. Through hashtags like #ThisFlagIsOursToo, they mobilise for the inclusion of queer people in the national narrative.

Although it doesn’t have as many users as Facebook and YouTube, we focused on TikTok because of its unique characteristics. Unlike other platforms, TikTok’s algorithm prioritises engagement over follower count, allowing even new creators to find a wide audience. This is important for a marginalised community seeking connection. This accessibility makes it a powerful tool for self-expression and community building within the LGBTIQ+ community.
Prosexy, for example, is a popular TikTok creator who uses the rainbow flag in their posts. Their content challenges traditional gender norms as Prosexy embraces both masculine and feminine elements in their appearance. Their posts, accompanied by hashtags like #hotgayinzimbabwe and rainbow emojis, assert their presence in Zimbabwe and reject the notion that the country is exclusively heterosexual. By sharing content from Zimbabwe and openly expressing their identity, Prosexy advocates for the recognition and acceptance of queer people in the nation.
Queer love as resistance
Some Zimbabweans on social media are showing their love for each other proudly and publicly. They think this can change how people see queer love in Zimbabwe. It’s like they’re sending love letters to the world, saying that queer love is just as important and beautiful as any other kind of love.

Another TikTok user, Mamo, and her partner often share videos of their romantic moments. They kiss, hold hands, and go on dates, showing that love knows no boundaries. They even dress up in traditional African clothes, showing that queer love is part of Zimbabwean culture too.
Seeing queer love on social media is important because it helps make it normal. When social media personalities like Tatelicious, a transgender woman, share their love stories, it shows that queer people are just like everyone else. At first, people were mean to her online, but now she has a lot of followers who support her and her partner.
Even though some people still react badly to LGBTIQ+ love on social media, it is a way for queer Zimbabweans to speak up and be heard. Their social media posts aren’t just for fun – they’re a way to fight back against discrimination and show the world that queer love is powerful and important.
Creating safe spaces
We found that social media platforms not only serve as tools for activism but also provide safe spaces for LGBTIQ+ individuals to express themselves freely. Online communities offer support, validation and resources to those who may face rejection and discrimination in their offline lives.

In the absence of spaces in the real everyday world where LGBTIQ+ people can openly and freely discuss such issues, virtual spaces become pivotal in affording avenues where topical issues can be discussed. These virtual spaces allow queer Zimbabweans to connect with others who share similar experiences and find a sense of belonging.
The limits of social media
Despite the benefits of social media like TikTok, it’s important to acknowledge that it can also perpetuate discrimination and violence. Queer content creators often face harassment, cyberbullying and abuse in the comments sections of their posts, which can have a negative impact on their mental health. While online spaces offer a degree of physical safety, they also present challenges in combating homophobia and ensuring a supportive environment for all users.
Yet it’s clear from our study that technology and online communities have provided a lifeline for many LGBTIQ+ Zimbabweans, offering them a platform to connect and share their experiences. Social media have created alternative spaces of belonging and solidarity. These spaces transcend geographical limitations and provide an escape from homophobia and threats of violence in the real world.

"2 knights, 1 horse â how a legendary Knights Templar symbol has puzzled and fascinated since the Middle Ages",https://theconversation.com/2-knights-1-horse-how-a-legendary-knights-templar-symbol-has-puzzled-and-fascinated-since-the-middle-ages-227849,3024292,"History, Religion, Christianity, Middle Ages, Medieval history, European history, Crusades, Christian, Quick reads, Knights Templar, Medieval Europe, Picture in 500 words","
The Knights Templar, a legendary monastic military order forged in the fires of the Crusades, continue to enthrall 21st-century audiences. 
From the time of their founding in 1119 C.E. to their dissolution in 1312 C.E., the Templars’ mission was to defend Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land against the various Muslim powers that sought to return the region to Islamic rule. In service of this mission, the order fused two defining institutions of the early Middle Ages: the mounted knight and the pious monk. 
At the time, this made the Templars something of a puzzle. How could someone be both a pious monk and a ferocious warrior? The Templars themselves tried to address this question in their symbology, which proved as puzzling as the order itself. 

One of the Templars’ more enigmatic symbols was their wax seal – two knights riding a single horse. In the Middle Ages, people used seals to protect important communications from forgery, acting like a signature. Everyone from individuals to organizations had their own unique seal. 





While the images on seals could be relatively simple and straightforward, they sometimes conveyed more subtle messages. The message of the Templars’ seal has always been open to interpretation.
Interpreting the Templar seal
While researching medieval geopolitics and the Third Crusade, I came across several interpretations of the Templar seal. 
The most popular ties the shared steed to the Templars’ vow of poverty. While the Order was not literally financially constrained, the symbol likely was meant to demonstrate that the Templars took the vow seriously.
Another draws a connection to the Gospel of Matthew, where one figure represents a knight and the other Jesus Christ. This interpretation stems from a Bible passage where Christ says, “For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.” The idea is that the two knights on a single horse embody the ever-present companionship of Christ with the Templars who had gathered in his name.
As part of a campaign to discredit the Templars, some suggested the two knights symbolized the homosexuality said to be rampant within the order.
Some propose that the two knights represent a duality within the order itself. The single horse could signify the unification of their seemingly contrasting roles as warrior-monk.
The seal’s inscription adds another layer of intrigue. Originally, the inscription read “Sigillum Militum Christi” – Latin for “Seal of the Soldiers of Christ.” In the mid-13th century, the order’s 19th grand master changed the inscription to “Sigillum Militum Xpisti,” replacing the Latin word for Christ with the Greek. Some scholars argue that using the Greek letters “XP” instead of the Latin “CHR” was intended to invoke Emperor Constantine’s vision at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. His victory allowed him to end the official persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.

Multiple meanings
While the exact meaning of the seal remains a riddle, there is little doubt it served as a powerful symbol of the knights’ commitment to their ideals.
The seal’s many interpretations resonate with different audiences. For some, it represents Christian soldiery and unwavering brotherhood. For others, it evokes the enigmatic nature of the Templars. And for others, it suggests corruption and sexual misconduct.
The seal serves as a window into the Knights Templar’s identity and impact on medieval Christian history. It is a symbol likely to continue to spark curiosity for centuries to come.

"For American Jews, interfaith weddings are a new normal â and creatively weave both traditions together",https://theconversation.com/for-american-jews-interfaith-weddings-are-a-new-normal-and-creatively-weave-both-traditions-together-229083,3024291,"Marriage, Judaism, Weddings, Ceremonies, Religion and society, interfaith families, Jewish traditions","
More than 10 years ago, I attended a college friend’s wedding in New York City.
My friend is Muslim, her husband Jewish. They were married under a Jewish wedding canopy made from the groom’s bar mitzvah prayer shawl – which, his mother announced to the assembled guests, had been made in India, the bride’s parents’ country of origin. The bride wore a red wedding sari. The groom’s mother read and explained the seven blessings of a Jewish wedding; the bride’s mother read from the Quran and then provided an English translation. 
The bride and groom sipped from the same cup of wine, as one does at a Jewish wedding. But knowing that I was writing about her wedding for my book on interfaith marriages, the bride pulled me aside in between the ceremony and the photos. They had replaced the traditional wine with white grape juice, she told me – nonalcoholic in deference to the fact that she is Muslim; white out of fear of staining the wedding finery before the photos.
My friend’s interfaith wedding might seem unusual, but it is part of the American Jewish normal. Approximately 42% of married Jews have a spouse who is not Jewish. Among American Jews who have gotten married since 2010, that percentage rises to 61%.





Many advocates for interfaith families prefer not to call these marriages between Jews and “non-Jews,” because that term defines people by what they are not – erasing their own vibrant religious and cultural heritage. There is great diversity in whom Jews marry. Most spouses come from Christian backgrounds, given the demographics of the United States, but Christianity itself is very diverse. Others marry Hindus, Muslims, Buddhists or people from any number of other religious traditions.
In my research on interfaith families, I’ve seen ceremonies combine traditions in a wide array of ways.
A meaningful canopy
Sometimes the Jewish wedding canopy, called a chuppah, is simply a beautiful piece of cloth, or combined with floral arrangements. Often, though, it represents family traditions. A bride or groom might use the same chuppah as their parents, use a family prayer shawl, or have a chuppah that combines fabric from both of their mothers’ wedding dresses. 

At interfaith ceremonies, the chuppah is often a way to weave another culture into the wedding. When Jews marry people from India – be they Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist or even another Jew – they will sometimes use a sari or a shawl with distinctively Indian embroidery to make the wedding canopy.
Another couple that I wrote about in “Beyond Chrismukkah,” a book based on my research on Jewish-Christian families, made the chuppah out of an African American story quilt that they then hung over their bed, with the intent that they would add a square for every year of their marriage. The last square that they added depicts two people standing together: her pregnant and him beaming. They laughingly told me that life got busy after the baby was born, and they are now over two decades behind. 
Still another bride and groom made a chuppah decorated with symbols, some of which represented them as individuals, and others narrating what brought them together as a couple. Their design included a Star of David for him and a flaming chalice, the symbol of the Unitarian Universalist Association, for her, and then the love of books and hiking that they shared.
Getting creative
While many rabbis are not allowed to formally co-officiate with clergy from other religions at weddings, some are able to do so.
Other rabbis allow another clergy person to offer a reading or take another role in the ceremony – sometimes to picturesque effect. At one wedding, a Catholic Franciscan friar offered a blessing in his brown robe and sandals, standing under a chuppah next to a rabbi wrapped in a Jewish prayer shawl.
No matter who performs the ceremony, couples often find creative ways to incorporate their traditions into the wedding day. Many pull readings from both of their traditions: some meaningful commentary on marriage, or even the famous biblical verse I Corinthians 13: “Love is patient, love is kind.” Jewish-Hindu couples may pair the seven Jewish wedding blessings with the seven steps taken in a Hindu wedding. 
Some couples have a Jewish ceremony but make other parts of their heritage a central part of the celebration: inviting a Christian relative to say grace before the supper, for example, or greeting guests at the reception venue with a Hindu aarti, in which one of the hosts will wave trays of lighted lamps in front of the guests to show them honor, respect and blessing. Often, families will include food from the non-Jewish culture, whether it’s elaborate Italian American dinners or Chinese wedding banquets.
Other interfaith couples will surround their Jewish wedding day with traditions from the non-Jewish culture. For instance, Jewish brides traditionally visit a ritual bath called a mikveh before their weddings. Some brides in Jewish-Hindu interfaith weddings follow the trip to the mikveh with a mehendi party and ladies’ sangeet: a night of henna painting and singing.

Tough conversations
Not everything is fun and easy in the world of interfaith weddings. More and more rabbis in the more liberal Reform, Reconstructionist and Renewal movements perform interfaith ceremonies. In August 2023, however, the Conservative movement reaffirmed its ban on Conservative rabbis performing interfaith marriages. 
During my research on interfaith families, couples told me many, many stories about their weddings – even though, in the end, I was not really writing about weddings. Sometimes, the stories were hard. One bride’s childhood rabbi refused to perform the ceremony, angering her parents so much that they quit their synagogue of 30 years. Some couples expressed pain about grandparents or aunts and uncles who skipped the ceremony. In one case, a woman expressed relief that her father had died before her nephew announced his engagement. She was glad that her father never said to his grandson what he had said to her when she fell in love with a Protestant.
Overall, however, most people’s weddings were happy memories that offered hints to the interfaith lives and household that they would go on to create together.

Quick adoption in 34 states of Erinâs Law to prevent child abuse shows power of one individual to make policy,https://theconversation.com/quick-adoption-in-34-states-of-erins-law-to-prevent-child-abuse-shows-power-of-one-individual-to-make-policy-221854,3024290,"Child abuse, Social workers, Child sexual abuse, State legislatures","
Policymaking, a process by which governments make decisions about how to address social issues, is shaped by various factors, such as the political climate, socioeconomic conditions and cultural and historical backgrounds. 
Some factors are obvious, others not. Often, policy is made by groups of people working together – advocates, regular citizens, lobbyists, lawmakers. 
Less often, there’s a single person who emerges as the key figure in making new policy. 
One of those people is Erin Merryn, a mother and social worker originally from the Chicago suburbs who endured abuse as a child. Her efforts as an adult ultimately resulted in 38 states passing legislation named Erin’s Law that aims to prevent child abuse through education of children in schools.





As scholars who study how public policy is made and implemented, we sought to answer questions raised by the adoption of this new policy, in light of the advocacy of one woman. Why did some states adopt Erin’s Law but not others? How do different state legislatures respond to interactions with what public policy scholars call a “policy entrepreneur” like Erin Merryn?
Laws were reactive
Erin’s Law, by and large, requires the teaching of prevention classes on child sexual abuse and exploitation to students in kindergarten through eighth grade, as the New York state law, for example, now mandates. 
Child abuse in the United States became a major public concern after the publication of “The Battered-Child Syndrome” in 1962. The book significantly raised social awareness of child abuse and highlighted the crucial roles that social workers, physicians and educators play in identifying and protecting children at risk.

However, meaningful state-level actions to address the problem were limited until Erin’s Law was enacted. Prior to Erin’s Law, much of the legislative response was limited to mandatory reporting of child abuse after it had occurred, which did little to prevent or detect abuse.
Erin’s Law was different – it aimed to prevent abuse before it starts through education, which is a proactive approach, rather than a reactive approach that focuses on abuse that has likely already happened.
In explaining how policies are adopted by government, political scientist John W. Kingdon emphasized the pivotal role of policy entrepreneurs like Merryn in pushing for a solution or drawing attention to specific policy problems. Kingdon wrote in 1984 that policy entrepreneurs are “advocates who are willing to invest their resources — time, energy, reputation, money — to promote a position in return for anticipated future gain in the form of material, purposive or solidary benefits.”
Policy entrepreneurs act as catalysts for making new policy by introducing new ideas, attracting media attention, building networks with legislators and providing them with essential information and perspectives. They persist in their efforts, even in the face of initial opposition.
Erin’s journey
As detailed in her book, “An Unimaginable Act” published in 2013, Merryn was sexually abused when she was 6 years old and suffered through continued abuse until her teens. This horrific experience encouraged Merryn to become a social worker. 
After getting a master’s degree in social work, writing multiple books about her experiences and dedicating years to social work, Merryn felt compelled to seek broader and systemic change through nationwide legislation. 
She left her job as a social worker and began touring state legislatures and engaging in advocating publicly for policy changes across the U.S. From 2011 to 2018, Merryn visited 36 states and spoke in legislatures a total of 111 times.
The first state in which Merryn tried to get the new policy adopted was her home state of Illinois, where she teamed up with a Republican state lawmaker, Sen. Tim Bivins. After four months of extensive research, they completed the initial draft of Erin’s Law. 
In November 2010, Merryn was invited to the Illinois State Capitol, where she delivered short testimony on the need for the law. Her testimony led the way for the policy to be adopted, and on Feb. 14, 2011, Gov. Pat Quinn signed Erin’s Law into effect.
Normally, policies are adopted when state legislators come together in regular sessions and debate in committees about the policy. With a deluge of information provided by their staff, lobbyists or their constituents – often all three – capturing state lawmakers’ attention can be extremely hard for members of the public. However, Merryn was able to gain lawmakers’ attention and consideration by employing a powerful story and passion — and, of course, with some luck.
Typically, Merryn’s visits came after her outreach to legislators via emails explaining Erin’s Law. This was often followed by lawmakers’ invitation to her to testify before legislative committees. 
These invitations to testify, though, were sparked in other ways, too.
Merryn’s testimony in Michigan emerged from a conversation with a senator’s aide at a family wedding. In New York, when Erin’s Law stalled in the Legislature, a phone call from actress Julianna Margulies to Mayor Mike Bloomberg led to Merryn getting time with state lawmakers. We believe that Bloomberg’s support provided Merryn with the policy allure needed to capture the attention of state lawmakers. And in Pennsylvania, her testimony came at a time when the Legislature was reeling from the Jerry Sandusky scandal, in which a longtime Penn State assistant coach was accused of, and found guilty of, sexual abuse of children. 
Merryn faced multiple roadblocks along the way, but her perseverance played an important role in the widespread adoption of Erin’s Law. Her recognition as the 2012 Glamour magazine “Woman of the Year” further boosted her visibility and impact as she continued the advocacy. 

Policy entrepreneurs get results
In our research, we have found that state legislatures frequently visited by policy entrepreneurs are more likely to adopt the new policy and do so more quickly compared to those with fewer or no visits from such individuals.  
Merryn’s visits, interactions and speaking engagements not only furnished legislatures and legislators with new information but also reframed the issue in a more politically palatable manner. Erin’s Law was presented as a protective, preventive and empowering approach for children, rather than a reactive one.
The influence of policy entrepreneurs relies on how well the issue they are advocating for aligns with the political landscape of the state. Merryn’s advocacy had a greater chance of helping legislation get passed in liberal states than conservative ones. In liberal states, more funds are spent on education, health and public safety, and preventing children’s victimization is a policy priority. 
Where there is alignment between policy entrepreneurs and legislators, they forge a symbiotic relationship, mutually aiding each other in achieving their goals. Policy adoption for policy entrepreneurs and likely gains in popularity for legislators can translate into electoral gains.
A policy entrepreneur’s success at getting a policy adopted by the legislature depends on the nature of the problem being addressed. Erin’s Law was more promptly adopted in states grappling with severe child abuse problems, demonstrated by increased incidents, reports and investigations.
It also was more promptly adopted in states with more female legislators. Women in legislatures are known to stress more heavily what are often seen as “women’s issues,” including children’s and families’ needs, domestic violence and social welfare. 
In those states where Erin’s Law has not yet been enacted, ongoing efforts to pass the legislation, including media engagement, lobbying, petitions and testimonies, are often led by Erin Merryn herself, along with legislators and child protection organizations.

Americans break election ties in crazy ways â and jeopardize democracy in the process,https://theconversation.com/americans-break-election-ties-in-crazy-ways-and-jeopardize-democracy-in-the-process-230153,3024289,"Democracy, Randomness, Election administration, Vote counting, US democracy, 2024 election, 2024 US election","
Commentators and observers are concerned about the possibility of a tie in the November 2024 presidential election. One possibility is that both major-party candidates end up with 269 electoral votes – one short of the 270 required to claim victory. Another scenario is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who appears to be attracting significant interest from the voters, collects a few electoral votes, preventing Biden or Trump from reaching the magic 270.
But then what? In recent decades, election ties have happened all over the country and have been resolved through bizarre, often comical procedures. The common feature of these methods is that the people’s wishes play no part in them. The voters are entirely removed from what is supposed to be a democratic process.
Strange tiebreakers
For instance, a 2006 local school board election in Alaska was decided by a coin toss, reelecting a woman who had actually died on Election Day.
In June 2009, candidates Thomas McGuire and Adam Trenk tied in the race for a City Council seat in Cave Creek, Arizona. They each got 660 votes. The town judge pulled a deck of cards from a cowboy hat, shuffled it and asked McGuire and Trenk to draw. McGuire drew the six of hearts. Trenk drew the king of hearts and got the seat on the council.





A 2014 city council election in Florida was resolved by a series of steps involving a coin flip and a bag of numbered pingpong balls.
And in January 2018, an official of the Virginia State Board of Elections, adhering to rules set forth in 1705, dipped his hand into a ceramic bowl made by a local artist and drew out one of the two containers in it. The paper inside that container said “David Yancey,” indicating that Yancey, a Republican, had won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. This was the final resolution of a tied election in which Yancey and Democratic opponent Shelley Simonds each received 11,607 votes.
Other election ties have been resolved by drawings out of a top hat and a tricorn hat. 
A range of rules
The rules for tiebreaking differ from place to place. New Mexico law mandates that a tie should be resolved by a game of chance, such as poker, while Nevada caucus ties call for drawing cards from a deck that has been shuffled at least seven times, with the highest card winning.
In research for my 2024 book “Making Democracy Count: How Mathematics Improves Voting, Electoral Maps, and Representation,” I found that more than half the states have some such lot-drawing or gaming procedure for breaking ties. Some require a runoff election to be held between the tying candidates, while some have the governor or the state board of elections decide the winner. In all cases, the course of action is either random, left to personal or political whims, or starts the election process over from the beginning.

More than half the votes?
This theater of the absurd doesn’t play out only on local stages. One of the most bewildering sets of tiebreaker rules applies to the nation’s biggest election, the one for president of the United States.
As initially set out in Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the winner of a presidential election must win more than half of the Electoral College votes. But if nobody gets a majority, which at present is 270, the decision goes to the House of Representatives.
The nonsense that happens next is manifold. First, according to the 12th Amendment, the House can choose from the top three finishers in the electoral vote count. So the winner does not have to be the winner of the popular vote, or even either of the two people who tied in the initial electoral count.
The 435 representatives in the House don’t each get to vote, either. Rather, each state’s delegation as a whole gets one vote. So there are 50 voters, all equal. At this stage, California and Wyoming have the same power, as do each of the other 48 states. Never mind that California has about 66 times more people than Wyoming and 52 times the number of representatives.
If a state delegation – all its representatives combined – can’t agree or is split down the middle, it loses its vote. The winner must get votes from a majority of states. Any gridlock in the process would have to be resolved by wheeling and dealing among the House members.
That’s the process for choosing a president. If nobody gets a majority in the Electoral College, the Senate would elect the vice president, though the rules are slightly different: Each senator gets to vote individually, and they can choose from only the top two recipients of electoral votes for the vice presidency. A simple majority of senators is necessary to declare a winner, according to the 12th Amendment. It’s not clear what would happen if the Senate vote resulted in a tie, though resolving it would also likely involve political scheming. 
These parallel processes mean that the House could elect a president from one party while the Senate elects the vice president from the other. And if the House can’t agree on a president, but the Senate selects a vice president, then the vice president-elect becomes president until the House decides.
Ending in a tie
Ties have happened before in presidential elections. The first occurred in 1800. After Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr each received 73 Electoral College votes, the 16 states of the Union voted 36 times to elect one of them but ended in a tie themselves. Jefferson was finally elected president on the 37th vote. Burr became vice president.
But Jefferson and Burr had been running mates, not opponents, so the result highlighted a complication in the original Constitution. In 1804, the 12th Amendment was passed to clarify the process of electing the president and vice president, in particular to require separate electoral votes be cast for the two.
In 1824, though, the presidential election went to the House again. Andrew Jackson, who ran as a political outsider, won the popular vote and more electoral votes than the other three candidates, though not a majority. After political maneuvering, the House chose the person who had come in second, John Quincy Adams – an insider Jackson had opposed – as the president.

A key weakness in US elections
All these tiebreaking methods are, in essence, arbitrary. Chance – not the people – decides who gets to act as the representative of the people. But the tiebreakers are necessary only because of a key weakness of the way most Americans vote for most offices: Voters cast a ballot for the one person they prefer, and winners are chosen by who gets the most votes.
The shortcoming is that voters identify only their top choice, so the process provides no information that could be used to break ties in some informed way. What’s left is dependence on centuries-old traditions, rules and laws that are at best inappropriate for our time and are frequently just plain ridiculous.
For presidential elections, abolishing the Electoral College or otherwise amending the methods by which states assign electoral votes wouldn’t help – because ties in the popular vote could still happen at either the state or national levels. They might be less likely with so many people voting, but they would still be mathematically possible, so any new system would need to incorporate a method for handling ties.
To avoid leaving the result to chance, our election systems would need to include a way for voters to provide more information about their preferences than just their top choice. Other voting methods exist that do so. Ranked choice voting, for instance, asks voters to identify not only their top choice but also their second, third and subsequent choices, depending on how many candidates there are. In case of a tie, the rankings beyond the first choice would allow election officials to determine a winner based on the wishes of the electorate – rather than letting democracy be determined by a deck of cards.

Risky business: Why executives keep finding themselves in political firestorms,https://theconversation.com/risky-business-why-executives-keep-finding-themselves-in-political-firestorms-221087,3024288,"Politics, Education, Economics, US politics, Risk, Business schools, Business school curriculum, MBA, American Dream, Social contract, Polarization, Business","
Back in March 2022, Disney’s then-CEO Bob Chapek said that his company wouldn’t take a public stand on Florida’s so-called “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Four days later, he yielded to rebukes from LGBTQ employees, reversed his decision and criticized the bill publicly. 
In the ensuing political firestorm, the state of Florida revoked Disney’s 55-year-old favored tax and regulatory status, sparking legal disputes that lasted well into 2024. Chapek, deeply weakened, was fired not long after the controversy broke, in November 2022.
Disney may be a unique case, but it isn’t alone. Business leaders are increasingly at risk of political sparks igniting into firestorms that can devastate their companies. For example, in 2023, the conservative backlash to a Bud Light promotional campaign involving a transgender influencer led to a 30% drop in sales volume.  
Leaders at BlackRock, Delta, Coca-Cola, Facebook, Google and Target, among other corporate titans, have recently become embroiled in similar culture-war debates. These sorts of controversies undermine businesses’ strategy and sometimes their performance, often in lasting ways.





How did we get here?
As longtime business school professors of strategic management, we wanted to understand why so many firestorms are now engulfing business leaders. In our recent research we developed a new theory, rooted in the realities of American politics, that provides a three-part answer. 
American politics are increasingly dysfunctional
First, many Americans think the American dream is out of reach. From middle-aged blue-collar workers to recent college graduates and beyond, people across American society are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the social contract. This has led to despair, jealousy and rising anger on both ends of the political spectrum.
Second, American political parties are using voters’ disillusionment and anger to drive fundraising. Each party emphasizes divisive, emotional wedge issues – such as immigration or welfare spending – typically related to the social contract. For candidates, adhering to the party platform and demonizing the other party can pay off, at least in the short term.
This leads to what scholars call “affective polarization,” which spawns animosity toward those with opposing views and expands the distance between opposing policy positions.
This animosity makes democratic government less effective, particularly at a time when the two major parties are near parity in terms of power, resources and electoral outcomes. Congress frequently faces political gridlock, forcing Republican and Democratic presidents alike to rely on executive orders and federal agencies to get work done. When control of the presidency shifts to the other party, executive-branch policies swing one from extreme to another, too.
We believe that ineffective government and policy uncertainty have undermined the American dream. As a result, disillusioned people are increasingly turning for help to the only other institution with enough resources to tackle these challenges: business.
That’s why companies have become the new nexus of political conflict and are facing pressure to take action on social justice, climate change and other issues that the government hasn’t effectively addressed. Corporate actions that touch these issues frequently place firms in between two deeply divided groups with opposing agendas – potentially sparking big controversies.
Business leadership is becoming more difficult
These issues are making executive positions far more challenging than they were just a decade ago. Culture-war firestorms can quickly overwhelm the conventional demands of setting and implementing business strategy. Executives must now spend substantial amounts of time, money and attention dealing with controversies.
This requires making new trade-offs. For example, research suggests that business investments that also benefit local stakeholders, such as communities and employees, get larger returns over the long term. But these investments are risky, because they lose value if the stakeholders refuse to cooperate later.
For example, Disney’s theme parks and hotels in Florida are difficult to relocate, despite adverse shifts in state government policy. Similarly, Chick-fil-A’s efforts to expand outside the American South were affected by opposition from politicians, as well as prospective employees and customers, over the founding family’s religious views and public comments about the definition of marriage.
If the polarization limits firm growth, investment returns and job creation, it would naturally shrink economic opportunities for shareholders and employees, possibly undermining confidence in the American dream even more. At the same time, firms face growing demands to spend on social responsibility. In an era of ubiquitous social media, failing to address stakeholder concerns can produce negative publicity, boycotts and other forms of backlash that can erupt into firestorms that hurt financial performance. 
What’s more, despite growing pressures for corporate social responsibility, it’s not always profitable or even good for society. Because managers’ attention is finite, responding to these demands distracts them from investments with more promising financial returns.
Managing trade-offs in this combustible environment requires knowledge and skills that most executives don’t yet have.
What should business schools do?
Business schools have been slow to prepare future executives for this new environment. Although business students usually learn about social responsibility, they generally don’t learn about the causes of government gridlock and political polarization, or how to deal with divisive social issues.
What’s more, while some people criticize business schools for not teaching enough about emerging social issues that affect business, others assail universities for emphasizing these issues too much.
For now, business schools generally don’t prioritize teaching about social contracts. Perhaps more importantly, they rarely explain how firms can strengthen democracy and effective government. 
Without business schools seeking to understand and address these issues and providing new training, we believe that future executives may not understand the opportunities they have to arrest the downward spiral.
Ultimately, it’s in everyone’s interest to expand business school curricula to include the dynamics of social contract formation, the process of affective polarization, the causes of government ineffectiveness and the reasons why business has become a nexus of sociopolitical conflict.
The failure to understand and address these issues can undermine the innovation and wealth that democracy and capitalism together have wrought. With proper knowledge and training, however, we believe that executives will be better prepared to help restore the social contract and confidence in the American dream – or perhaps to help to create a new one.

How the âmodel minorityâ myth harms Asian Americans,https://theconversation.com/how-the-model-minority-myth-harms-asian-americans-230815,3024287,"Discrimination, Inequality, Workplace, Stereotypes, Asian Americans, Model minority, Workplace discrimination, Pacific Islanders, Microaggressions, AAPI","
May is Asian and Pacific American Heritage Month, a time when Americans celebrate the profound contributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders – a group that is commonly abbreviated as AAPI – to U.S. society. It’s also a time to acknowledge the complexity of AAPI experience.
And as a professor who studies equity and inclusion in business, I think the focus on AAPI communities this month provides an excellent occasion to push back against a stereotype that has long misrepresented and marginalized a diverse range of people: the myth of the “model minority.”
The term “model minority” first appeared in popular media in the 1960s to describe East Asians – primarily Japanese and Chinese Americans – as having high educational attainment, high family median income and low crime rates. That label has since been applied to all AAPIs.
More than half of native-born Asian Americans have heard of the “model minority” description. Among those who are familiar with it, 4 in 10 feel it is harmful. 





Racially visible, in practice invisible
The narrative of the “model minority” portrays Asian Americans as uniformly successful and privileged. Yet the reality is far more complex. In reality, AAPIs encompass over 20 distinct ethnicities, yet are often lumped into a single category. 
This obscures wealth and status disparities within the community. Income inequality among AAPIs is high, with more than 10 groups, including Burmese, Hmong and Mongolians, experiencing poverty at rates equal to or worse than the national average.
The myth of the model minority erases the struggles of these underserved communities. It also perpetuates the harmful notion that AAPIs don’t need support or advocacy to address systemic inequities.
The myth also undermines AAPIs in the workplace. Research shows that the depiction of AAPIs as diligent and hardworking has burdened them with additional responsibilities. Unfortunately, their efforts often go unnoticed. Stereotypes portraying Asians as passive and unassertive also frequently lead to their talents being overlooked for managerial and leadership positions. Top executives in Fortune 500 companies of East Asian descent make less than their non-Asian counterparts. 
AAPIs also often encounter unique barriers to upward mobility in the workplace — a phenomenon known as the “bamboo ceiling.” They may struggle to align with stereotypical Western models of leadership, which include assertiveness and extraversion, and are disproportionately passed over for promotions, particularly into upper-level management.
Forever foreign
Alongside the myth of the model minority, another related narrative holds that AAPIs are perpetual foreigners – a manifestation of racism or xenophobia, where naturalized or even native-born Americans are viewed as outsiders because of their ethic or racial background. 
This myth has persisted despite generations of assimilation. Asians have often been viewed as outsiders since their arrival on American shores in the mid-19th century, labeled under the broad umbrella of “Orientals” and subjected to a variety of stereotypes.
As a result, AAPIs often face intrusive questions about their origins, such as “Where are you really from?” and “Your English is really good.” These and similar microaggressions can lead AAPIs to grapple with a sense of otherness that undermines their sense of belonging at work and beyond.
The belief that AAPIs are America’s “other” — compounded by historical prejudices such as the “yellow peril” and contemporary scapegoating during events such as the COVID-19 pandemic — fuels xenophobia and anti-Asian violence. This poses a real and immediate threat to the safety and well-being of AAPI individuals and communities.
Time for a post-model-minority narrative
The model minority narrative not only implicitly denies remedies to systemic discrimination, but it also harms other marginalized and oppressed groups. It implicitly suggests that non-Asians and non-Asian Americans cannot be considered model minorities. 
Successful AAPIs are often presented as examples of what’s possible through hard work and grit — which masks the systemic barriers they, like other people of color, must overcome to succeed. This, in effect, pits different racial groups against each other.
This Asian Heritage Month – and all year round – I hope people can embrace a more inclusive and nuanced understanding of AAPI experiences. A few ways to do this include amplifying the voices of underrepresented AAPI communities, challenging stereotypes and advocating for policies that address the systemic inequities faced by all marginalized groups. 
And instead of narrowly defining success in terms of elite credentials and earning power, Americans might want to consider celebrating more diverse forms of achievement, too.

Iranâs intervention in Sudanâs civil war advances its geopolitical goals â but not without risks,https://theconversation.com/irans-intervention-in-sudans-civil-war-advances-its-geopolitical-goals-but-not-without-risks-229989,3024286,"Africa, Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE, Ethiopia, Sudan, Civil war, Omar al-Bashir, Arms exports, Abraham Accords, Tigray war","
Iran’s role in funding and arming proxy groups in the Middle East has been well documented and has gotten extra attention since the Hamas-led attack in Israel in October 2023. Similarly, Tehran’s arms shipments to Russia are well known and have prompted complaints and sanctions from the West.
But Tehran has received little coverage of its military intervention in another deadly conflict: Sudan’s civil war. 
Since that conflict started in April 2023, it has killed at least 13,000 people, injured over 33,000 others and displaced millions more. After years of relative peace, people are once again being massacred in the southern region of Darfur.
In the immediate aftermath of fighting breaking out between two rival factions of Sudan’s military government, Iran limited its involvement to supplying humanitarian aid.





But that policy didn’t last long. Between December 2023 and January 2024, Tehran supplied several Mohajer-6 midrange reconnaissance and combat drones to President Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF.
In February, the drones helped the SAF take territory from Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as “Hemedti,” and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, during an offensive in the city of Omdurman.

While the conflict in Sudan has gotten less global attention than those in Ukraine and Gaza, it is strategically significant for Tehran. As an expert on  Iran’s foreign policy, I see how Tehran is increasingly using involvement in African conflict zones to advance the country’s military, commercial and particularly geopolitical goals. It follows a similar trajectory as Iran’s involvement in Ethiopia during the Tigray war of 2020-22.
Projecting power
Militarily and commercially, drone exports to the SAF have been a continuation of Iran’s actions since the expiration of a U.N. arms embargo against Tehran in October 2020.
Since then, Iran has delivered surveillance and attack drones not only to its quasi- and nonstate proxies and partners in the Middle East – such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen – but also increasingly to states outside the region such as Ethiopia, Russia, Tajikistan and Venezuela.
Iran has done this to project power, strengthen alliances and influence conflicts in the Middle East and other regions. At the same time, it can prove a lucrative source of income for the Iranian economy, as well as a showcase for the country’s technology. While it is difficult to determine the precise revenue Iran has received from military drone exports, the estimated value of the global market in 2022 was US$12.55 billion, a figure expected to reach $14.14 billion in 2023 and $35.60 billion in 2030.
In regards to Sudan, arming the SAF helps both Iran’s wider geopolitical goals and its competition with regional rivals, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. 
Rogue states
Iran-Sudan relations date back to 1989, when Tehran backed the coup led by Omar al-Bashir, who later became the president of Sudan. During the 1990s and 2000s, Iran offered development assistance and military aid to Sudan. It exported tractors there and stationed naval vessels at Sudanese ports in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.

Along these strategic routes and shipping lanes, Tehran exported oil to African countries and smuggled weapons to regional clients, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian militants in Gaza. 
As a fellow so-called rogue state subjected to U.S. sanctions and embargoes, Sudan provided diplomatic support to Tehran throughout the period. 
It recognized Iran’s right to pursue a nuclear program and voted against U.N. General Assembly resolutions condemning Tehran’s human rights record. From 1979 to 2021, Sudan ranked as Iran’s third-largest trading partner in Africa and accounted for 3% of its average annual trade with the continent.
But between 2013 and 2016, Iran-Sudan relations suffered a series of severe setbacks. In 2014, Sudan closed Iran’s cultural center and expelled its diplomatic officials for purportedly proselytizing Shiism in a predominantly Sunni country. Two years later, in 2016, it and other countries in the Horn of Africa cut formal ties with Tehran.
These setbacks resulted from Iran disengaging from Sudan and Africa to concentrate on nuclear diplomacy with the United States and other world powers. They also coincided with growing military, diplomatic and economic assistance from Saudi Arabia and the UAE to Sudan and other states in the Horn of Africa in exchange for joining the Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.
This assistance was especially enticing to Sudan as it confronted isolation and economic adversity as a result of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for al-Bashir, the secession of oil-rich South Sudan and the imposition of intensified sanctions by the U.S.
Despite Iran and Sudan subsequently participating in multilateral meetings on agricultural cooperation, the bilateral relations between the countries never fully recovered.
Making inroads in the Horn
The civil war has provided an opportunity for Iran to correct course with Sudan. Supporting the SAF can help Tehran salvage relations with Sudan while also countering or containing Saudi and Emirate influence in the country and the wider continent.
Tehran aspires to assist al-Burhan and the SAF win the war and take back control of the state. 
Giving assistance to the SAF also fits a dynamic that predates the war and again relates to Iran’s battle for influence with Saudi Arabia. In 2019, while Hemedti served alongside al-Burhan in the Transitional Military Council after al-Bashir’s ouster by a coup, he visited Saudi Arabia and pledged support for it against Iran and the Houthis.
Nonetheless, supporting the SAF is not without risks for Iran.
For starters, a victory for al-Burhan and the SAF is far from certain. Since October 2023, the RSF has taken some key states, including the capital of Khartoum and the breadbasket of Gezira. In February 2024, the SAF launched an offensive in Omdurman and made gains there. However, the overall balance may still tilt in the RSF’s favor.
And unlike the wars in Syria and Ukraine, in Sudan, Tehran has found itself in the awkward position of supporting an adversary of Russia, which sponsors the RSF.
And contrary to the Ethiopia conflict, in which Iran supported the government against rebel groups alongside Turkey and the UAE, Tehran and Abu Dhabi are competing for influence in Sudan by backing the SAF and RSF, respectively. Outside the military realm, the UAE has a sizable economic edge over Iran as Sudan’s largest export partner and second largest import partner.
Fueling conflict
Even if al-Burhan were to emerge victorious, it’s not a given that Iran’s position in Sudan would significantly improve or its influence grow. 
Iran is constrained by being a Shiite power; Sudan is a Sunni-majority country. And even before Sudan severed ties with Iran and descended into another civil war, it had long accepted agricultural, commercial, developmental and military assistance from Iran’s regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
After Khartoum joined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, it normalized relations with Tel Aviv through the Abraham Accords in return for diplomatic and economic incentives from the U.S. 
Time will tell whether Iran’s military intervention in Sudan marks a turning point in bilateral relations, or whether it’s nothing more than a weapons transfer in another civil conflict fueled by foreign intervention.

"What QAnon supporters, butthole sunners and New Age spiritualists have in common",https://theconversation.com/what-qanon-supporters-butthole-sunners-and-new-age-spiritualists-have-in-common-228857,3024285,"Social media, Politics, Education, Tanning, Conspiracy theories, Semen, Urine, GOP, Distrust, Subcultures, Liberals, Wellness, Shamanism, QAnon, Anti-vaxxers, Great Replacement Theory, RFK Jr., Online algorithms","
After the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, former NBA player Royce White became an outspoken advocate of defunding the police. Over those ensuing months, he appeared at a number of protests and marches in Minnesota – demonstrations that conservative politicians and pundits excoriated.
Four years later, White accepted the endorsement of the Minnesota GOP in the state’s 2024 U.S. Senate race. 
In the interim, White had appeared on the show of conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, where he decried the “establishment” and “corporatocracy.” While on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, he complained that women “had become too mouthy.” Elsewhere, he lambasted the LGBTQ+ movement as “Luciferian” and described Israel as the vanguard of a “new world order.”
White’s transition from an NBA player who advocated for progressive causes to an acolyte of Jones is more common than you might think. 
Many people might associate conspiracy theories with certain demographics or political leanings. But the reality is far more nuanced, with emerging research finding that there is far more diversity among conspiracists than scholars previously thought.
Conspiracy theories are just as likely to be held by your MAGA-hat wearing uncle as they are your best friend who’s a fan of the band Phish and goes to CrossFit three times a week. 
Entering the margins
For the past four and a half years, I’ve immersed myself in spaces occupied by conspiracy theorists. 
What began as an attempt to understand the QAnon conspiracy movement quickly expanded into an exploration of a wide range of alternative belief systems. 
These include, but are not limited to, discredited intellectuals who promote race science; butthole sunners who believe that by harnessing the sun’s rays, they live longer; and semen retention enthusiasts, which is a practice that discourages ejaculation as a way to boost testosterone levels.
Most researchers have understood conspiracy theories and alternative beliefs as being a product of poor education or misinformation spread on social media. But recent research has found that support for them exists regardless of educational level or income. Some of the most privileged people in U.S. society hold deeply conspiratorial beliefs, as do sports fans, yogis and video game enthusiasts.
While some many say that believing in UFOs or Bigfoot may not be that big of a problem, these ideas can lead to real-world harms. Butthole sunning, for example,  has been linked with cancer. 
By understanding how conspiracy theories and alternative belief systems intersect and evolve over time, you can see how anyone – no matter their political leanings – can become subsumed by them.
Forbidden knowledge
Different conspiracy theories, forms of psuedoscience and discredited beliefs – such as the notion that the Earth is flat – occupy the same space. 
They are part of a collective waste bin of discarded ideas, a phenomenon that political scientist Michale Barkun characterizes as “stigmatized knowledge.” Because they’ve been discredited by mainstream institutions, they often only emerge on the fringes of society.
Certain stigmatized narratives can also become tools wielded by politicians and media influencers who will say or do anything to make money and gain power.

For example, in their book “Conspirituality: How New Age Conspiracy Theories Became a Health Threat,” Derek Berry, Matthew Remski and Julien Walker document the ways in which contemporary New Age spiritualism has been hijacked by social media influencers, who have then gone on to promote vaccine misinformation and foment government mistrust.
Social media platforms provide financial incentives for individuals creating the most engaging content. Of course, what’s engaging is not necessarily what’s accurate or truthful. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these influencers became popular by suggesting that they had “sacred” or “secret” knowledge on how to defeat the virus. 
It’s one way people can go from embracing seemingly harmless ideas, like Bigfoot, to becoming open to more radical beliefs like the Great Replacement Theory, which is the conspiracy theory that illegal immigrants are colluding with Democrats to change the racial demographics of America and, in doing so, shape future elections.
The intersection of politics and alternative beliefs is not a recent phenomenon. 
Some of these beliefs, like the imaginary continent of Atlantis, were used by the Nazi party to create a link to a mythical pure race. Indeed, a key component of the Nazi’s rise to power was the promotion of ideas that today would be described as New Age mysticism – a spiritual movement that emphasizes magical experiences and the notion that spiritual forces connect everything in the universe. 
The complexity of conspiracists
While many pundits point to white Christian nationalists as the group most susceptible to conspiracies – and there is some truth to this claim – it’s important to pay attention to others who possess conspiratorial ideas.
The anti-vaccine movement is now a pet issue for many on the right, but it first gained notoriety among wealthy liberals. One of the most visible promoters of the movement is current presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
Jacob Chansley, also known as the “QAnon Shaman,” is another well-known example of this juxtaposition: He’s been seen protesting on behalf of both right- and left-wing causes and was at the Jan. 6, 2021, storming of the U.S. Capitol.
A 2021 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 23% of Republicans believe that “the government, media and financial worlds in the U.S. are controlled by a group of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.” 
The number might seem high, but probably isn’t all that surprising: It’s one of the core tenants of the right-wing QAnon conspiracy theory. But I found the survey’s other findings somewhat startling – that 8% of self-identified Democrats and 14% of independents also agreed with that statement.
Where do we go from here?
While seemingly unrelated at first glance, conspiracy theories such as QAnon and alternative wellness practices such as drinking urine share common themes. Namely, they’re united by distrust in mainstream institutions. They long for alternative belief systems that confirm their existing beliefs and ignore contradicting evidence.
Being critical of those in positions of power is a healthy thing, but there are times in which trust in leadership makes sense – like listening to firefighters evacuating a building or public health officials during a global pandemic.

In fairness, the number of Americans who believe in conspiracy theories does not seem to be rising. At the same time, conspiracies were a core motivator for many of the Jan 6 protesters who attempted to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power.
As the contributors to my forthcoming edited essay collection argue, conspiracy-laden narratives not only undermine societal institutions, but they also strain relationships with fellow citizens. They train people to be suspicious of trusted sources of information – and suspicious of one another.
None of that bodes well for liberal democracy.

Is Labour ready for government? Understanding Keir Starmerâs narrative of renewal,https://theconversation.com/is-labour-ready-for-government-understanding-keir-starmers-narrative-of-renewal-230380,3024284,"UK politics, Labour Party, Tony Blair, British history, Labour history, Harold Wilson, Keir Starmer, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
Is Labour ready for government? This question is being asked regularly of the public by pollsters YouGov, especially as the UK approaches the general election on July 4. For many, the answer is a measure of the extent to which Keir Starmer has changed the party since he became leader.
The idea is that if a leader can modernise their party via policy review and personnel changes, then they could similarly change and improve the country. It is, effectively, a test of leadership skills, alongside a demonstration that they can stamp their authority on their party.
To determine whether Starmer has sufficiently demonstrated this leadership skill, we can briefly look back at how Tony Blair and David Cameron modernised their parties before entering government. Has Starmer also engaged in such deep renewal while in opposition?

Over the coming weeks, we’ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we’ll fact check the claims being made. Sign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.

Rhetorically speaking, the importance of the idea of wholesale change led from the centre is designed to create a narrative following a previous defeat. In essence, it is a story told by the leadership of how they accepted defeat but have now reflected and changed in response. For Blair and Cameron, it was about understanding what message the public was sending when they decided not to vote for them. 
Blair interpreted the 1992 defeat as a message that voters did not yet trust the Labour party with the powers of government. The party was seen as lacking preparedness and as not sharing the values of the post-Thatcher electorate. They feared that, at heart, Labour was still prone to nationalisation, which risked reversing the Thatcher reforms of the 1980s.
Cameron interpreted his party’s 2005 defeat as a signal that the Conservative party needed to take its divisions seriously, move beyond the debates and divisions over Europe, and embrace certain aspects of social liberalism. By doing so, Cameron aimed to show the Conservatives were not a risk to the socially liberal country.
Both leaders, therefore, took the defeats their party endured as a sign that they had to change to become compatible with the values of the country and, in turn, the high offices of power which they sought.
In preparation for the election ahead, Starmer has been at pains to show how his party has changed since its 2019 defeat. For Starmer, this is about disowning Jeremy Corbyn and Corbynism by portraying his leadership as a more mature and sensible alternative.
Labour’s most successful renewal projects
Historically, Labour renewal projects have been about moving beyond the perception that it was an out-of-date, ideologically driven party. Those leaders who have aimed to change the narrative have sought to show that Labour not only accepted the modern world, but in fact embraced it and could lead from the front by embedding social democracy within it. Harold Wilson attempted this with the rhetoric of “scientific socialism” during his white heat of technology speech in 1963.
Blair controversially reformed clause four of the Labour party constitution to signal that he was moving the party away from socialism. It changed the party’s identity beyond recognition, but Blair’s aim was to show that the party he led had been reformed and could be trusted. 

Starmer’s problem is that he lacks a clear indicator of a similarly substantive change.
Despite this, his arguments seek to portray Labour as a modern party that has changed in opposition and is now ready to address the problems of the modern world. For example, dealing with economic reconstruction following the COVID legacy, as well as accepting that Brexit and its consequences are facts of life, while promising reforming ties with the European Union. 
A key part of embracing this reality has been the acceptance that the fiscal position of the UK will be challenging, leaving Labour with tough decisions over spending priorities – something that was less of a concern for Blair in 1997.
Part of the problem facing Starmer is the perception that he reverses on key pledges. He may announce large projects such as reforms of social care, the House of Lords, and mental health but the public feel unsure of whether he would then water them down or reverse entirely due to the fiscal concerns. This is not a luxury he can not afford during an election campaign.
This tendency risks creating confusion among voters, who may lose sight of the overarching message of change and renewal. Indeed, the reversals risk creating the perception that Labour is simply testing ideas on the voter before deciding to go another route. 
The consequence of this is that it puts Labour’s credibility into question. It appears uncertain what they stand for. Consistency is a key part of presenting a credible governing agenda ahead of an election.
Meanwhile, across the aisle
However, if we were to conclude that Labour was not yet ready for government, we need to contextualise this against the position of the Conservatives. The Tories have been in office for 14 turbulent years, first presiding over austerity, then the Scottish independence referendum, Brexit, and COVID. 
Since the last general election, they have had three different leaders (five since 2015), with one being the shortest in history.
It has not been an easy period of office and there are signs that global conflict will bedevil whoever takes office after the July election. But the key point here is the Conservatives are suffering from an absence of innovation, a lack of internal cohesion, fluctuating leadership, and a sense that it is time for a change. 
Put simply, the Conservatives have become less fit for office than the Labour party because of this sense of leadership fatigue and policy vacuum.
The lack of consistency in his message still clouds Starmer’s attempts to convince voters that he should be prime minister, even if they can sense a change in tone and attitude from the Corbyn years. However, the degeneration of the Conservatives suggests that their road takes them back to the opposition benches, regardless.

Carlo Acutis: what the first âmillennial saintâ says about the Catholic churchâs future,https://theconversation.com/carlo-acutis-what-the-first-millennial-saint-says-about-the-catholic-churchs-future-231086,3024230,"Religion, Catholicism, Church, Saints, Give me perspective","
The London-born Italian teenager Carlo Acutis is likely to become the first “millennial saint” after two miracles attributed to him were recognised by Pope Francis. 
Spending most of his life in Milan, Acutis was an incredibly devout Catholic who went on regular pilgrimages across Europe. He had a desire to attend mass daily and regularly pray the rosary – but he also loved playing video games and teaching himself computer coding and animation. 
Aged only 15, Acutis was diagnosed with untreatable leukaemia. He died in 2006 and was eventually buried in Assisi. 
The cause for his canonisation started in 2013 and he was designated “venerable” in 2018, a term which recognises that an individual was “heroic in virtue” through their actions during their lifetime. After the approval of the first miracle – the healing of a Brazilian child’s pancreas after the boy venerated (prayed to and revered) one of Acutis’s relics – he was declared “blessed” in 2020 at the Basilica of Saint Francis of Assisi. 





A year earlier, Acutis’s remains had been moved to the Church of Santa Maria Maggiore in Assisi, where his body and relics have been on display ever since. An official livestream is witness to the constant flow of pilgrims that visit him. The second miracle attributed to Acutis, in 2022, saw a woman from Costa Rica recover from severe head trauma and craniotomy surgery despite her chance of survival being incredibly low. 

Speaking about Acutis in 2020, Pope Francis discussed the characteristics of the youngster that he admired – values that were to be aspired to by all Catholics, especially younger ones. 
According to the pope, Acutis did not “ease into comfortable immobilism” during his lifetime, but rather “understood the needs of his time” and adapted, while still believing that “true happiness is found by putting God in first place”. This statement could serve as a summary of the pope’s own attitude to change and adaptation within the church, in its engagement with the modern world.
The new potential saint aligns with the church’s ongoing approach to issues around AI, science and technology, which the pope has insisted must be used at the service of human dignity and human development. 
In 2019, a landmark workshop by the Pontifical Academy for Life gathered scientists, ethicists and theologians together in Rome to discuss the future of robotics. Since then, the pope has continued this progressive approach, supporting schemes encouraging children to get into computer programming and becoming the first pope to write a line of code.
Having a young, digitally “switched on” saint brings a new emphasis to Catholic teaching on young people’s engagement with the internet and the digital world more broadly. 

When Pope Francis wrote about the potential dangers of technology and social media in his exhortation Christus Vivit in 2019, he referred to Acutis as an example of a young person who “knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty”. Such remarks show both the openness of the church to engage with these platforms, and the caution it believes younger generations still need to apply to their digital lives.
During his lifetime, Acutis created a website cataloguing every reported Eucharistic miracle in the world, and every approved apparition of the Virgin Mary. After his death, a travelling exhibition based on this catalogue has visited dozens of countries. It is this blend of digital communication and traditional Catholic teaching and morality that the church will be keen to foster in future generations.
The canonisations of saints can often be a signifier of change and renewal within the church. In 1622, for example, there was a bumper crop of canonisations: Francis Xavier (1506-1552), Ignatius of Loyola (1491-1556), Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), and Philip Neri (1515-1595). These were characteristic of the strength of a renewed Catholicism after the challenge of the Protestant Reformation. 
Acutis’s potential canonisation could be the beginning of a new era in a church dealing with the challenges of the digital age. But he is not a saint just yet. 
Pope Francis will first convene a consistory of cardinals to deliberate the canonisation. Once approved, a date can be set for a mass of canonisation and thereafter, the official acknowledgement of sainthood throughout the Catholic church – at which point, Acutis will become a model of holiness in a digital age.

Isolated phonics lessons arenât working: hereâs a better way to teach young children to read and write,https://theconversation.com/isolated-phonics-lessons-arent-working-heres-a-better-way-to-teach-young-children-to-read-and-write-230272,3024229,"Phonics, Reading, Primary school, Learning to read, UK Schools, Educate me","
Since 2010, five and six year-old children in England have been taught to read using a particular variant of “systematic phonics”. 
“Phonics” describes methods of teaching reading that emphasise  teaching how phonemes – the smallest sounds in the words of oral language – are represented by letters. In England the type of phonics teaching is best described as “narrow synthetic phonics”. 
This is because England’s curriculum policies and guidance have restricted phonics lessons to an overwhelming emphasis on phonemes and letters at the expense of other aspects of reading, and writing, that are not to be covered in phonics lessons. Phonics is taught using special “decodable books”, rather than real books. 
Aspects such as comprehension, engaging with real books, and writing activities, are all to be taught in different lessons. Yet my research and other studies have found that a more effective way of teaching reading would see phonics and decoding taught with these other main elements, in lessons that should focus on reading and writing at the same time. 





One consequence of England’s synthetic phonics is that children are likely to be less motivated to read, because synthetic phonics lessons are not focused on motivation and real purposes for reading.
Models of reading
The way reading is taught in England stems from the interpretation of an influential theory known as “The Simple View of Reading”. This proposed that reading comprises two elements: decoding and comprehension. In England, this has led to the separation of the teaching of decoding from other parts of the curriculum subject of English. 
In spite of some positive aspects, the main limitation of the Simple View of Reading – and some other, similar models for learning to read – is that the original evidence base was research done with children who struggle with reading, rather than research done with more typical readers. 
What’s more, the models do not include various elements that are important for effective teaching because they are more focused on a limited range of elements of children’s learning. For example, the different languages and dialects that children may speak are not accounted for.
My new research with colleague Charlotte Hacking proposes a new model of reading, which we call the “Double Helix”. 

The starting points for teaching inspired by our Double Helix model are children, their languages, their experiences in homes and communities, and the texts that they have encountered. Lessons focus first and foremost on motivating children through use of real books – standard books written for children rather than texts specially produced for phonics schemes. 
The lessons integrate the teaching of reading and writing. All lessons are driven by the need to motivate children and to ensure that the purposes of reading and writing, to comprehend and compose texts, are first and foremost. 
Phonemes and letters are taught, but this teaching is integrated with other vital components of reading. For example, lessons should always use whole texts – books with stories rather than decodable books – to stimulate children’s interest. A focus on a particular phoneme to be taught is done by selecting a word and sentence in the text then identifying how the letters in the word represent the phoneme. A range of other discussions and activities are also part of this phonics teaching. 
During a lesson using this approach, children would be asked to comment on all kinds of questions about the pictures and the story, not just questions about phonemes and letters. They would do writing in the lesson. Phonics teaching would be part of the new approach to teaching, but balanced with all the other elements, so that reading and writing made sense.
There is an international trend towards an increasing use of synthetic phonics, seen in Australia, provinces of Canada and the USA. In some countries this trend has been influenced by the narrow approach to synthetic phonics in England that intensified from 2010 onwards. 
But as an expert in reading education, I think that this trend is not backed up by a balanced and rigorous appraisal of the evidence of what works in the teaching of reading and writing. There are other, better ways than England’s focus on synthetic phonics.

Descartes and the deep state: what 17th-century philosophy reveals about Trump and QAnon,https://theconversation.com/descartes-and-the-deep-state-what-17th-century-philosophy-reveals-about-trump-and-qanon-229675,3024228,"Donald Trump, Deep state, QAnon, Give me perspective, US election 2024","
What if I were to tell you that the US government and media is controlled by a secret cabal of devil-worshippers who are organising the mass kidnapping of children? Well, according to a recent poll, 17% of Americans believe this to be the case. 
Another 30% believe the 2020 US presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump. A further 36% think the COVID-19 pandemic was intentionally planned by a global elite.
If these figures are anything to go by, a worrying number of Americans believe reality is not what it seems. More specifically, they endorse the conspiracy theories collectively known as QAnon, a conspiracy group which has become something of a quasi-religious cult since its emergence in 2017. 
QAnon’s overarching doctrine is that the “deep state” – a secret network of global elites with its own political agenda – is controlling world affairs. Although this might seem ludicrous, an element of this doctrine has long been taken very seriously by philosophers – that, for all we know, our understanding of the world around us is deeply distorted.





This idea – often referred to as radical doubt or scepticism – was famously articulated by the 17th-century French philosopher and mathematician René Descartes in his Meditations on First Philosophy. Realising that many of his previous beliefs were mistaken, Descartes suggested that an all-powerful “evil genius” could be systematically deceiving him about his most basic beliefs – much like how the supposed deep state is apparently deceiving those who believe in QAnon. 
From this, Descartes set out to demolish any beliefs that weren’t “completely certain and indubitable”, and then to “start again from the ‘foundations’”.
Trump the messiah
Just as Descartes seeks certainty about the world, so supporters of QAnon (known as QAnons) seek a day of reckoning prophesied by its anonymous figure-head, “Q”, called “the storm”. As researchers on radicalisation Mia Bloom and  Sophia Moskalenko note, this is the supposed day that Trump will arrest those upholding the deep state and either send them to Guantanamo Bay or execute them. In the aftermath, people will celebrate the “great awakening” as they are freed from their deception.

In the weeks leading up to the January 6 US Capitol attack, they remained eerily silent, but there were some high-profile QAnons involved in the riot. After that, the storm was meant to occur on January 20 2021 – US presidential inauguration day. However, instead of dismantling the deep state, Trump left the White House. Disappointed, QAnons either doubled-down on their convictions or drifted away from the movement.
That was until November 2022, when Trump announced his 2024 presidential campaign. After two years, QAnon’s messiah figure had returned and, since then, Trump has been galvanising QAnons to take the battle to the deep state once again. On February 11 2024, he posted the following call to arms on his Truth Social platform:

2024 is our Final Battle. With you at my side, we will demolish the Deep State … we will rout the Fake News Media, we will Drain the Swamp, and we will liberate our country from these tyrants and villains once and for all!

Trust the plan
Descartes famously found certainty in his capacity to think: “I think, therefore I am”. The idea is that, even if he doubted his own bodily experience, he could not doubt his existence as a thinker. That’s because doubting that you’re thinking is, itself, a form of thinking. 
This certainty, referred to as the Cogito, provided Descartes with the foundations to escape the hypothetical “evil genius” deception.
There seems to be a different kind of Cogito at play in QAnon’s overarching mantra, “Where we go one, we go all”. This is a call for solidarity amongst QAnons to “trust the plan” – Q’s prophecy that Trump will prevail over the deep state. 
But doesn’t that imply there is at least something in the world worth trusting? If there wasn’t, it’s difficult to see how there could be a plan to trust in the first place – and it would be difficult to understand how QAnons could even trust each other. So, the very existence of QAnon must presuppose a degree of trust, which is a foundational certainty for QAnons.
Many QAnons “trust the plan” because they report feeling fearful, anxious, and isolated in the world. QAnon and Trump may have earned trust by preying on these emotional vulnerabilities. 
Like any good conspiracy theory, QAnon claims to offer its devotees social and existential shelter from the deep state. Like any good saviour, Trump promises to destroy the deep state. This might explain why his 2024 presidential campaign has coincided with renewed support for QAnon.
Ultimately, QAnon is underpinned by a trust that’s rooted in fear and anxiety. By overcoming these fears and anxieties, one stands a better chance of escaping its grip. As with fear more generally, courage is typically the antidote. 
QAnons potentially have a network of support just waiting for them. They just need the courage to seek it from those outside their circle.

How extreme weather will affect the insurance and energy sectors,https://theconversation.com/how-extreme-weather-will-affect-the-insurance-and-energy-sectors-228342,3024227,"Climate change, Climate, Energy, Insurance, Extreme weather, Give me perspective","
When Storm Isha hit Northern Ireland and northern Britain in January 2024, wind gusts of almost 100mph caused widespread damage to property. This strong extra-tropical cyclone also influenced both the insurance and energy sectors. Isha resulted in damages which required the insurance industry to pay out approximately €500 million (£427 million). 
That’s a significant financial impact, yet considerably smaller than some previous extreme weather events, such as Storm Lothar which affected much larger regions of Europe with losses of nearly €10 billion.
Storm Isha also affected the energy sector. Fallen trees and high winds brought down power lines, so hundreds of thousands of homes lost power. Some energy traders benefited as the high wind speeds led to record-breaking wind power production and significant energy price drops. More than 70% of Britain’s electricity came from wind turbines at the peak of the storm, compared to an average of 30%.
Energy systems are being pushed to the brink by wind storms and heatwaves, compounded by gas shortages and price rises caused by the war in Ukraine. 





Extreme weather events cause extensive economic damages, with more than US$100 billion (£80 billion) of this being covered by insurance in 2023. Understanding these extremes is, therefore, of great societal and economic interest. But the impacts of extreme weather vary depending on the industry. An event that benefits the energy sector can be detrimental to the insurance industry, and vice versa.

Climate change is likely to intensify these extreme weather events, potentially increasing or altering their impact on the energy and insurance sectors. With a greater frequency of heatwaves, pressure on energy systems will probably increase. Stronger storms could mean more damage and potentially higher premiums from the insurance industry. So it is essential that the meaning of extreme is understood in each context – this could help researchers like us, and society as a whole, to predict events and understand losses.
Focusing on the insurance sector, extreme weather events are of interest due to the potential to cause destruction and damages that need to be financially covered. Hurricanes and severe tropical cyclones are of greatest interest due to wind damage and flooding. From 2018 to 2022, these events caused economic losses of more than $450 billion, with just under half of this being insured. The costliest event in the past 50 years was Hurricane Katrina which devastated New Orleans in the US in 2005, resulting in approximately $100 billion insured losses.
The insurance industry classifies events with loss potential into primary and secondary hazards. Primary hazards, which include hurricanes, windstorms and earthquakes, have potential to cause the highest losses. Secondary hazards, such as wildfires or hail storms, occur more frequently and cause low to medium losses.
For primary hazards, such as European windstorms, it’s easy to assume that more events occurring causes higher insured losses. But only the strongest events are of interest, because these cause the most widespread damages. For example, the recent 2023-2024 winter season featured a very high number of storms in western Europe, but only one caused significant damage – from November 1 and 2 2023, Storm Ciarán hit France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK, resulting in approximately €2 billion in insured losses. 
Despite the low impact on insurance, that winter season had a very high impact on the agricultural sector, due to extensive and persistent flooding that affected farmland and ruined crops.
Another factor to consider for insurers is the affected area and the economic exposure. Strong wind gusts and heavy precipitation from a hurricane over the Gulf of Mexico, or even sparsely populated parts of the US coastline, have little impact. But a hurricane impacting a built-up metropolitan area (as Hurricane Katrina did for New Orleans) will lead to huge damages and loss of life.
Insurance companies evaluating risks must account for a combination of the most extreme weather systems, and those affecting built-up, developed areas. The most risk-prone areas are quantified by examining historical events and assessing other possible scenarios that are generated by models. Risk experts also consider what impact historical events would have today. Increases in risk may be due to increases in population, density of the built environment, or GDP. For example, Hurricane Katrina’s impact would be $40 billion higher if it occurred today.
Many types of extreme weather, from dust storms to heavy snowfall, can have adverse impacts on energy infrastructure, generation and demand. Windstorms and flooding can damage power lines or the substations that distribute electricity to homes and businesses. In October 2023, Storm Babet left more than 100,000 people without power in northern England.
Extreme weather also influences the amount of renewable electricity being generated by wind, solar and hydropower. Wind droughts – low wind periods – are of particular concern. A prolonged wind drought from April to September 2021 affected the UK, Ireland and other parts of western Europe, with wind speeds almost 15% lower than average. This means that more gas has to be burned to produce enough electricity to meet demand. Researchers from the Met Office recently calculated that there is a one-in-40 chance of three consecutive weeks of low wind speeds (and low power generation) in any given winter.

Extreme weather affects energy demand. Temperature influences the amount of demand for heating and cooling, but wind speed and direction and rainfall also play a part. Southern European heatwaves are associated with a rise in energy demand of up to 10%, mostly due to air conditioning, according to researchers in Spain.
These impacts often overlap. Researchers from across Europe showed that wind droughts are particularly an issue if they coincide with extreme temperatures (which leads to high energy demand for heating or cooling). The impacts of extreme weather are further complicated by society’s move towards a more weather-dependent energy system and the changing distribution of extremes in a warming climate.
As our understanding of how extreme weather affects these two sectors develops, it is imperative that weather and climate information is tailored to professionals and researchers in each sector, so it can help to mitigate future damage and long term impacts.

"How genes shape birdsong, even when birds grow up far from home",https://theconversation.com/how-genes-shape-birdsong-even-when-birds-grow-up-far-from-home-230789,3024226,"Genetics, Evolution, Wildlife, Birds, Animal behaviour, Genes, BirdLife, animal reproduction, Bird song, Educate me","
With the arrival of spring, a timeless ritual begins anew: male birds fill the air with song, seeking to attract mates and defend their territories from other competing males.
But there is a lot we still don’t understand about how birds learn which sounds to sing. Our latest study offers new insights and suggests genes may play a more important role than scientists realised. 
In nearly half of the world’s bird species, young birds learn by imitating the songs of adults. As birds learn songs from one another, mistakes inevitably happen, leading to variation in songs between populations of the same species, similar to the formation of dialects in human languages. 
Female birds usually prefer males that sing songs typical of the local population, as it may show that they are well adapted to the nearby environment. Additionally, songs are crucial for defending territories. Male birds singing foreign songs often struggle to hold onto territories against local competitors.





This potential role as a mating and social barrier is why there has been a long-standing hypothesis that song differences can drive the formation of a new species.
However, scientists don’t yet fully understand what happens to these song differences when birds move between populations. Imagine you’re a local bird, and a newcomer arrives singing a foreign song. What’s to stop you from learning this new song? If enough local birds learn the songs of newcomers, it could erase the song differences between populations, and thus the mating barrier.
But birds tend to only learn songs from their own species, even when they are exposed to the birdsong of other species. This suggests that birds have genetic predispositions guiding them to learn only “appropriate” songs. So far, these genetic predispositions have only been shown to limit song learning from different species.
This raises an interesting possibility. Could these genetic predispositions also restrict song learning within the same species — and could it explain why some song differences are maintained across different populations of the same species?
There are a few lab-based studies that have explored this idea. But it has rarely been tested in the wild, where birds are exposed to songs from different populations and species. 
That’s why we wanted to see whether these lab results would hold true if we took the test into the field. 
Into the wild
In the spring seasons of 2017-2019, we translocated eggs of pied flycatchers (a small migratory songbird that breeds widely across Europe) from their nests in the Netherlands to a population in Sweden. We carefully transported these eggs to their new home, where they were placed in Swedish nests and eventually, raised by Swedish parents. Come winter, these translocated birds fledged and made the long journey to their wintering grounds in Africa, along with their Dutch and Swedish counterparts. With the return of spring, they flew back to Sweden, now as adults with fully formed songs, ready to find potential mates.

We recorded the songs of these birds and compared them to the songs of their local Swedish environment where they were raised. We also compared them to songs of their ancestral Dutch population. Overall, songs of translocated males resembled songs of the Swedish population.
This came as no surprise, since we know that social learning plays a crucial role in song development for pied flycatchers. However, we discovered that translocated males did not just learn any Swedish song element — they learned those elements most similar to their ancestral Dutch population. This meant their songs did not completely overlap with Swedish ones but resembled both Swedish and Dutch songs. This suggests that the translocated males are genetically predisposed to learn songs of their ancestral Dutch population.
These findings show how genetic differences within a species can effect cultural change. We think that as songs continue to diverge between these two populations, the genetic predispositions should also become more distinct. Eventually, birds from the local population may not recognise immigrants from other populations as part of their own species as regional variations tend to become more pronounced over time. This co-evolution between genes and songs may reduce the likelihood of birds from different populations mating with each other, driving the formation of new species.

Understanding how ions flow in and out of the tiniest pores promises better energy storage devices,https://theconversation.com/understanding-how-ions-flow-in-and-out-of-the-tiniest-pores-promises-better-energy-storage-devices-228845,3024225,"Engineering, Energy storage, Electrical engineering, capacitor, Materials science, Battery, Supercapacitors, Nanopores","
Modern life relies on electricity and electrical devices, from cars and buses to phones and laptops, to the electrical systems in homes. Behind many of these devices is a type of energy storage device, the supercapacitor. My team of engineers is working on making these supercapacitors even better at storing energy by studying how they store energy at the nanoscale.
Supercapacitors, like batteries, are energy storage devices. They charge faster than batteries, often in a few seconds to a minute, but generally store less energy. They’re used in devices that require storing or supplying a burst of energy over a short span of time. In your car and in elevators, they can help recover energy during braking to slow down. They help meet fluctuating energy demand in laptops and cameras, and they stabilize the energy loads in electrical grids.

Batteries operate via reactions in which chemical species give or take electrons. Supercapacitors, in contrast, do not rely on reactions and are kind of like a charge sponge. When you dip a sponge in water, it soaks up the water because the sponge is porous – it contains empty pores where water can be absorbed. The best supercapacitors soak up the most charge per unit of volume, meaning they have a high capacity for energy storage without taking up too much space.
In research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May 2024, my student Filipe Henrique, collaborator Pawel Zuk and I describe how ions move in a network of nanopores, or tiny pores that are only nanometers wide. This research could one day improve the energy storage capabilities of supercapacitors. 





All about the pores
Scientists can increase a material’s capacitance, or ability to store charge, by making its surface porous at the nanoscale. A nanoporous material can have a surface area as high as 20,000 square meters (215,278 square feet) – the equivalent of about four football fields – in just 10 grams (one-third of an ounce) of weight.
Over the past 20 years, researchers have studied how to control this porous structure and the flow of ions, which are tiny charged particles, through the material. Understanding the flow of ions can help researchers control the rate at which a supercapacitor charges and releases energy. 
But researchers still don’t know exactly how ions flow into and out of porous materials. 
Each pore in a sheet of porous materials is a small hole filled with both positive and negative ions. The pore’s opening connects to a reservoir of positive and negative ions. These ions come from an electrolyte, a conductive fluid. 

For instance, if you put salt in water, each salt molecule separates into a positively charged sodium ion and a negatively charged chloride ion. 
When the surface of the pore is charged, ions flow from the reservoir into the pore or vice versa. If the surface is positively charged, negative ions flow into the pore from the reservoir, and positively charged ions leave the pore as they’re repelled away. This flow forms capacitors, which hold the charge in place and store energy. When the surface charge is discharged, the ions flow in the reverse direction and the energy is released. 
Now, imagine a pore divides into two different branched pores. How do the ions flow from the main pore to these branches? 
Think of the ions as cars and pores as roads. Traffic flow on one single road is straightforward. But at an intersection, you need rules to prevent an accident or traffic jam, so we have traffic lights and roundabouts. However, scientists don’t totally understand the rules that ions flowing through a junction follow. Figuring out these rules could help researchers understand how a supercapacitor will charge. 
Modifying a law of physics
Engineers generally use a set of physics laws called “Kirchoff’s laws” to determine the distribution of electrical current across a junction. However, Kirchhoff’s circuit laws were derived for electron transport, not ion transport. 
Electrons only move when there’s an electric field, but ions can move without an electric field, through diffusion. In the same way a pinch of salt slowly dissolves throughout a glass of water, ions move from more concentrated areas to less concentrated areas. 

Kirchhoff’s laws are like accounting principles for circuit junctions. The first law says that the current entering a junction must equal the current leaving it. The second law states that voltage, the pressure pushing electrons through the current, can’t abruptly change across a junction. Otherwise, it would create an extra current and disrupt the balance. 

Since ions also move by diffusion and not only by the use of an electric field, my team modified Kirchhoff’s laws to fit ionic currents. We replaced voltage, V, with an electrochemical voltage, φ, which combines voltage and diffusion. This modification allowed us to analyze networks of pores, which was previously impossible.
We used the modified Kirchoff’s law to simulate and predict how ions flow through a large network of nanopores. 
The road ahead
Our study found that splitting current from a pore into junctions can slow down how fast charged ions flow into the material. But that depends on where the split is. And how these pores are arranged throughout the materials affects the charging speed, too.
This research opens new doors to understanding the materials in supercapacitors and developing better ones. 
For example, our model can help scientists simulate different pore networks to see which best matches their experimental data and optimize the materials they use in supercapacitors. 
While our work focused on simple networks, researchers could apply this approach to much larger and more complex networks to better understand how a material’s porous structure affects its performance.
In the future, supercapacitors may be made out of biodegradable materials, power flexible wearable devices, and may be customizable through 3D printing. Understanding ion flow is a key step toward improving supercapacitors for faster electronics.

View from The Hill: Albanese says cabinet âcrafting an offer for the second termâ as Ed Husic ponders breaks for business,https://theconversation.com/view-from-the-hill-albanese-says-cabinet-crafting-an-offer-for-the-second-term-as-ed-husic-ponders-breaks-for-business-231067,3023777,"Labor Party, Ed Husic, Albanese government","
A few days ago, after yet more early election speculation, the prime minister was indicating he plans to run full term, which would put the election in May next year, with another budget before it. 
On Tuesday, Anthony Albanese told caucus the term was in its final 12 months and “the work of the cabinet is now on crafting an offer for the second term” of the government. 
This can be seen as sensible forward planning. Equally, it is further evidence of how politics is now in what’s dubbed the “permanent campaign”. 
There’s much less of a sharp distinction these days between election and non-election periods. Politicians are forever on the campaign trail, no one more than Albanese who is constantly travelling the country in what must be an exhausting schedule that inevitably cuts into “thinking” time. 





In the “permanent campaign”, politics increasingly bleeds into policy. They were never fully separate, of course, but there comes a tipping point, when policies can be seriously compromised by pursuit of the politics. 
In the battle for political advantage, the presentation of policy is carefully managed. So announcements are given out by the government on an embargoed basis, to maximise the chance of getting a clear run in the morning media – a condition of the embargo is journalists can’t get comment from stakeholders, experts or the other side. Years ago, this used to be more limited to actual election campaigns, rather than being standard practice during the period in between. 
It’s often said longer parliamentary terms would improve the prospect of governments being able to promote policies that were not so relentlessly focused on the politics. Governments could take hard decisions that were unpopular in the short term, with time for the benefits to be judged. 
Given how ingrained the “permanent campaign” has become, it is not clear its habits would be broken by extending the term from three to four years. Regardless, longer terms would require a referendum, and we know that won’t happen. 
The 24-hour media cycle promotes the permanent campaign. Today’s media is voracious and both sides are desperate to feed the beast. The Albanese government, with its lists of media appearances sent out daily and more extensive resources, is better at this than the Dutton opposition. 
All this frenetic activity produces a lot of junk media and junk politics, with politicians on both sides often just parroting “talking points”.  
As the cabinet looks to its second term agenda, ministers will need to bed down, to the extent that is possible, the issues it is still confronting in its first term. 
We are in the era of “crisis” politics. We’ve got a cost of living crisis. A housing crisis. A domestic violence crisis. A potential energy crisis (some say). An emerging social cohesion crisis. 
None of these crises is going to be solved, or even much reduced, by the time the election comes around. But the government will need to be able to present  convincing evidence it is making progress in dealing with each of them. The opposition will require a persuasive spiel that it could meet them better. Peter Dutton’s recently announced immigration policy has been a salutary tale of how things go when you don’t have ready answers to obvious questions. 
In crafting that second term agenda, one central question for Labor will be how it pitches its program. With such a slender majority, will the government want to be cautious, as Albanese was in 2022? Or will it present a muscular program, even at the risk of scaring some voters? 
A more minor question is what it will do with that long-standing commitment to pursue a republic. Given a referendum for a republic is a bridge too far, will that aspiration be binned or kept in the nostalgia basket? Presumably a second term would not have a minister for the republic, a low-task post now held by Matt Thistlethwaite. 
More pertinent, now that Albanese has declared cabinet is focused on the election, is whether the PM is thinking about a reshuffle of his frontbench.    
His ministry has been remarkably scandal-free. This is an achievement. Usually by this point in a term, one or two ministers would have come to grief. 
But the two years have exposed some poor performers and, despite mostly tight discipline, some differences of view. 
Home Affairs Minister Clare O'Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles continue to be weak links, with rolling issues over former immigration detainees and crimes committed by other non-citizens. 
The problem is that governments don’t want to put blood in the water by moving ministers who are on the back foot, but a reshuffle in coming months should be considered. 
On policy differences, Industry Minister Ed Husic has been the standout. On Tuesday, he used a Financial Review conference to advocate some relief on company tax.
“I believe, in the strongest Labor traditions, we need to be able to bring business and labour together and show that everyone wins.
""That has been the hallmark of previous Labor governments and we need to consider that.
""How we do that – either through corporate tax reform or the way in which we provide investment allowances for the uptick in manufacturing capital – that is something long term, I think, [that] does need to be considered.”
A big question mark for the next election’s competing agendas is what each side will promise on tax, one of the most sensitive hip pocket issues. 
Will the government hold out more income tax relief, albeit at the cost of limiting its spending options? And to what extent will the opposition feel the need to provide higher income earners some compensation for the forfeit of part of their stage 3 tax cuts, even at the cost of limiting its ability to offer more to taxpayers further down the income scale? 

Correction: this article originally made reference to Treasurer Jim Chalmers being in the room during Ed Husic’s remarks. He was not in fact present, so this sentence has been removed.

Catching public transport in Queensland will soon cost just 50 cents. Are cheap fares good policy?,https://theconversation.com/catching-public-transport-in-queensland-will-soon-cost-just-50-cents-are-cheap-fares-good-policy-230979,3023591,"Transport, Equity, Public transport, Queensland, Bus, Transport policy, Train, Better Cities, Steven Miles","
As part of a six-month trial, public transport fares in Queensland will soon be slashed to just 50 cents per trip for everyone. 
The cheap fares will apply to all trips on buses, light rail, trains, and ferries, over any distance, in cities and towns that are part of the Translink network. 
Very-low flat fares have become fashionable policy as governments respond to cost of living pressures around the world. 

In 2022, Germany experimented with a flat-rate €9 per-month rail pass over a 90-day period. And just last year, the UK government implemented a £2 fare cap on many single bus journeys in England.
Last summer, Western Australia offered free public transport to SmartRider pass users for five weeks. 
“Captive” users of public transport – who have limited access to private vehicles and few alternatives – would surely welcome such schemes. 
But who stands to benefit the most? Is offering free or nearly-free public transport a good policy idea? 
The benefits aren’t spread evenly
Some trips across Queensland will now be extraordinarily cheap. You’ll be able to travel from the Sunshine Coast to the Gold Coast for just 50 cents, if you don’t mind a four-hour trip on trams, trains and buses. 
At an individual level, adults travelling the longest distances will benefit most. But as a group, commuters in the inner and middle suburbs of Brisbane and tertiary students will enjoy most of the benefits. 

There are a few regional cities with well-frequented bus services, notably Townsville and Toowoomba. Passengers travelling from Yeppoon to Rockhampton, or from Proserpine airport to Airlie Beach, will get inter-city travel at an amazing price. 
But the regions will otherwise benefit less than in South East Queensland, given the limited demand for public transport, and the lesser provision of services. 
Will people ditch their cars and get back on public transport?
Queensland’s government hopes the move will boost public transport usage and reduce congestion. 
The impacts of low flat fares on patronage have been studied elsewhere. Early reports from Germany suggested that €9-a-month fares were popular and even led to some overcrowding during peak tourist seasons. 

To investigate the trial, researchers conducted a before-and-after survey to understand behaviour changes. They found that public transport use did increase, but not all trips taken privately were substituted. 
It has been argued that car ownership produces lock-in effects. Affordable fares are only one of the motivators that can encourage a shift to public transport. Buses and trains also need to be frequent, reliable and comfortable when competing against private car travel.
The layout of Queensland’s cities and towns is highly car dependent. Our previous work has examined how spatial layout and the availability of public transport affect its patronage in different cities. Transport statistics reveal only about 10% of trips use public transport in Brisbane, while the figure is as high as 90% in Hong Kong. 

The new low fares might help relieve congestion on a few arterial roads where public transport corridors run alongside an alternative, most notably on the M1 motorway between the Gold Coast and Brisbane. But with limited public transport coverage across much of Queensland, heavily discounted fares may not lead to a dramatic uptake in use. 
What will the social and economic impact be?
This leads to a bigger debate on how we should price public transport and who should pay for it. 
There is no straightforward answer to this. Even when public transport is made very cheap or even free, someone ultimately has to pay for it. The merits of any pricing policy should be evaluated in terms of the winners and losers across society as a whole, referred to as transport equity. Equity can have two dimensions:  

horizontal – reducing inequality between people in similar groups
vertical – giving a greater share of resources to disadvantaged groups. 


Everyone in Queensland will now pay 50 cents, no matter how far they go, which creates strong horizontal equity between travellers. 
But the wealthy have reclaimed the centre of Australian cities, including Brisbane. As these nearly-free flat fares benefit so many inner-city and middle-suburban commuters, a very hefty subsidy will be going to a group who don’t necessarily need it, paid for by other forms of taxation.
Are there other ways to subsidise public transport?
Yes. One alternative is to directly target programs to those in need, such as by ring fencing benefits to a smaller area. This was recently tested in Los Angeles under a program called Universal Basic Mobility. 
A transport stipend of US$150 per month was provided via a debit card called a “mobility wallet” to residents of a disadvantaged neighbourhood. The card could be also used for e-scooters, taxis and even Uber or Lyft. Service improvements were also rolled out.

Queensland itself has long provided free fares where they are seen to have a social benefit. The largest city councils often provide free bus travel for seniors outside peak hours, and popular “free” public transport to large stadiums for concerts or sporting events is covered by a fee hidden in the ticket price. 
The state has also trialled another alternative – the ODIN Pass – which provides affordable multi-mode (bus, train, ferry and e-scooter) trips for students via a “Mobility as a Service (MaaS)” smartphone app. 
Free or heavily discounted public transport can be a good idea – where it can help meet social goals. But it’s best when targeted at the most disadvantaged.

Stand by for a pay rise on top of a tax cut. Hereâs why things will feel better from July,https://theconversation.com/stand-by-for-a-pay-rise-on-top-of-a-tax-cut-heres-why-things-will-feel-better-from-july-231006,3023538,"Inflation, Gender equality, Fair Work Commission, wages growth, Federal budget 2024","
At the moment, things look awful.
The latest Bureau of Statistics count of retail spending (spending online and in shops) released Tuesday shows we spent less in April than in February.
The Westpac card tracker, which tracks spending by Westpac customers, shows spending on essentials has fallen 1.6% since April. Spending on non-essentials (what Westpac calls discretionary spending) has fallen 2.2%.
Each month for decades now the Melbourne Institute has asked Australians whether “now is the right time to buy a major household item”.
This month, in a survey conducted just before and just after the federal budget, only 15.2% said it was. That’s the second-lowest percentage in the three decades I have been keeping results. 
Go back a few years to the time before COVID (and even during COVID in the lockdowns) and the proportion was typically double – 30-40% of Australians said now was a good time to buy a major household item.



The economic growth figures due for release next week might well show living standards, as measured by GDP per person, going backward for the fourth consecutive quarter – for an entire year. 
It’s something that hasn’t happened since the early 1980s, in more than 40 years.
The good news (and there is good news) is things are about to get a little better, beginning very soon, in July.
Reasons to be (more) cheerful
Already well publicised (probably over-publicised given its size) is the $300 per household electricity rebate, which will work out at $75 per quarter, or 82 cents per day.
In some states there will be more. The West Australian government is offering an extra $400, and the Queensland government an extra $1,000.
Added to this will be lower electricity prices for most customers not already on a good deal. The Australian Energy Regulator has announced cuts in the maximum that can be charged of 2% to 4% beginning in July.
Tax cuts hit pay packets in July
Much more important will be the long-awaited (and revamped) Stage 3 tax cuts due finally to hit pay packets in July. 
For a middle-earning Australian (half earn more than this, half earn less) on $67,600 it’ll mean a tax cut of $1,369, or $52.60 every fortnight.
And there’s something likely to make an even bigger difference to the one in five Australian workers whose pay is set by an award rather than an enterprise agreement or an individual contract.
For many, wage increases will be bigger
Next Monday the Fair Work Commission will announce the increase in award wages due to take effect four weeks later on July 1.
In headline terms (and there’s more to it than the headline this time, as I’ll outline shortly) the Australian Council of Trades Unions is asking for 5%.
One of the employer groups, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is asking for much less, and much less than the rate of inflation – just 2%.

Its chief executive Andrew McKellar says employers’ legislated superannuation contributions are set to climb by 0.5% of most wages in July, meaning the cost to employers of a 2% increase would be 2.5%.
Another employers body, the Australian Industry Group, is suggesting 2.8%, which is also less than the rate of inflation.
The government itself wants at least the rate of inflation for workers on low pay. It has asked the commission to ensure the “real wages of Australia’s low-paid workers do not go backwards”.
It’s a fair bet the commission will award at least the rate of inflation. 
On only two occasions in the past decade has the commission awarded less than the published annual rate of inflation at the time. One was when businesses were in danger of going under as COVID hit in 2020 and the other was last year, when inflation was an unusually high 7%.



The most recent quarterly inflation figures point to an annual rate of 3.6%. (There will be an update on the more experimental monthly figure on Wednesday, but the commission is unlikely to pay too much attention to that).
That’ll mean an increase of 3.6% to 4% from July highly likely, which for an Australian on an award wage of $67,600 will mean an after-tax increase of at least $1,703, which is $65.50 per fortnight, on top of the fortnightly tax cut of $52.60.
There was a bizarre moment at last week’s hearing when the Australian Industry Group tried to argue that whatever increase the commission thought was fair should be cut to take account of the benefit workers would get from the tax cut.
Fair Work Commission President Adam Hatcher pointed out the commission had never boosted pay to compensate for the higher tax payments that flowed from bracket creep, and asked rhetorically: “why should we go in the other direction now?”
Wage decision unlikely to feed inflation
History suggests that if the wage rise the commission hands to Australians on awards is substantial, it won’t spark broader wage inflation. Only about 20% of workers are on awards. Many of them have low rates of pay, and many of them work in retail and hospitality.
Last year the commission awarded them 5.75%. Overall wages didn’t jump in response, climbing just 4.1%.
And there might be something else for low-paid workers. By law, the commission is now required to redress the undervaluation of work in industries traditionally dominated by women.
The Australian Council of Trades Unions has asked that, as an interim measure, workers in industries that require “emotional labour” be given an extra 4%.
We will find out on Monday.

Changing native vegetation laws to allow burning on private land is good fire management,https://theconversation.com/changing-native-vegetation-laws-to-allow-burning-on-private-land-is-good-fire-management-229796,3023390,"Conservation, Bushfires, Environment, native vegetation, native vegetation clearing, Wildfires, Fire risk, Controlled burning, Black summer, bushfire risk, Black Summer fires, Wildfire management","
Bushfires cause catastrophic biodiversity loss across Australia. In the Black Summer of 2019–20 alone, 103,400 square kilometres of habitat went up in flames. 
The irony is, laws to protect native vegetation did nothing to prevent this destruction. This is because, in most states, these laws make it hard for private landholders to burn on their own land, meaning more fuel is left to feed bushfires.
We have a chance to change that now in South Australia, where the Native Vegetation Act is under review.
With greater knowledge and understanding of the role of fire in the Australian landscape, we can take better care of native vegetation on private land as well as public parks. There’s a strong case to be made for private landholders to conduct their own cool burns, for dual purposes of reducing fuel load and restoring ecosystems.





Fire can be good for biodiversity
A wide range of species will benefit from good fire management, which creates a patchwork of different ages of vegetation. 
Some plant and animal species are found only in long-unburnt vegetation. Others need recently burnt areas. Many shrubs only occur in areas burnt in the past 15–20 years. 
Fire is also needed to maintain food supplies for many threatened animals. For example, the glossy black-cockatoo feeds almost exclusively on the seeds of drooping sheoak trees. But seeds become scarce in long-unburnt vegetation. 
Breaking up the landscape should also mean fewer animals will be caught in each fire, because they have places to which they can escape.

Managing fire at landscape scale
Proactive burning can reduce wildfire risk under most conditions, when managed at the whole-of-landscape scale. This requires everyone to manage fire on their own land in a coordinated way. Such an approach emulates Indigenous land management and was partially adopted by land managers in southern Australia until the 1970s.
Private landholders are no longer allowed to contribute to these efforts, perhaps because the community distrusts both farmers and fire. However, without landholder involvement, fire management capacity is severely limited. 
For instance, National Parks and Wildlife Service South Australia’s Burning on Private Land program has managed only 28 hectares of fuel reduction burns on Kangaroo Island since Black Summer. Given forest fuel loads can reach dangerous levels six years after bushfire, the next big one may not be far away. 
Climate change means catastrophic bushfires will happen more frequently. Addressing this escalating risk requires allowing landholders to manage fire hazards on their own land. 

The devastating Black Summer wildfires
The Black Summer fires killed an estimated three billion animals and drove at least 20 threatened species closer to extinction. 
Human lives were lost, livestock perished. More than half of Kangaroo Island burned, including areas that had not seen fire since the 1930s. Along with 96% of Flinders Chase National Park, about 40,000 hectares of native vegetation burned on privately owned land.
While nothing could prevent the spread of fires under catastrophic weather conditions, many of Black Summer’s fires started earlier. They may have been better controlled, or stopped altogether before conditions got out of hand, if the vegetation was not so thick and connected. The very small amount of fuel reduction being undertaken on private land is inadequate.

Burning does not equal land clearing
In 1985, SA introduced the first laws in Australia to protect native vegetation. These effectively stopped the widespread clearance of native vegetation in the state. 
However, they have done little to maintain or restore its ecological condition. Since the laws were passed, we have learned more about the effects of fire in Australian landscapes. We now know proactive use of fire can make vegetation more complex and biodiverse. So, fire needs to be actively managed, not excluded.
While well-intended, the existing legislation discourages burning by private landholders, making it almost impossible for them to take responsibility for reducing fuel loads on their own land. This is because South Australia’s Native Vegetation Act defines all burning as clearance.
What do other states do?
Both New South Wales and Western Australia also classify burning as clearing. In Victoria, approval for burning on private land is managed at the local government level and appears to have no provision for ecological burning. 
Elsewhere, burning is only considered to be clearance when it is intentionally used for the purpose of destroying native vegetation, as in Tasmania, Queensland and the Northern Territory, or remnant trees, in the case of the Australian Capital Territory. 
All states and territories allow exemptions for the purpose of bushfire prevention or fire fighting. None has incorporated fire management for ecological purposes into their native vegetation legislation.
An opportunity for legislative change
So far, proposed changes to the SA Native Vegetation Act have missed an opportunity to reduce wildfire risk across the state. 
This could be fixed by simply changing the definition of clearance to exclude fire used for ecological purposes. This is effectively the case in Queensland, where fire is only considered to be clearing when it is specifically used to destroy native vegetation. 
SA’s Native Vegetation Council would then need to provide guidance on how landholders should burn to both reduce fuel loads and benefit biodiversity. This should extend the current advice to provide the type of detailed ecological and operational information that is provided in Queensland.
Changing South Australia’s Native Vegetation Act to facilitate fire management by landholders is one step we can take to minimise the risk of catastrophic wildfires. The next steps are trusting landholders to take this responsibility seriously and help them do so. This would bring South Australia back to the forefront of native vegetation management in Australia.

"From Mary Poppins to Winnie the Pooh, Richard Sherman wrote the soundtrack of life for generations of children",https://theconversation.com/from-mary-poppins-to-winnie-the-pooh-richard-sherman-wrote-the-soundtrack-of-life-for-generations-of-children-231054,3023389,"Music, Obituary, Screen, Disney, Hollywood, Composer","
Walt Disney songwriter Richard M. Sherman, who has died aged 95, wrote some of Hollywood’s greatest film musical songs and brightened the days of children, parents and school teachers around the world. 
Working with his brother Robert, who died in 2012 aged 86, Richard created chirpy, toe-tapping and often poignant songs in Hollywood films such as Mary Poppins (1964), Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (1968), The Jungle Book (1967) and Bedknobs and Broomsticks (1971). 
The Sherman brothers were responsible for the scores of more motion pictures than any other songwriting team. 
Over the past 70 years, millions of children have learned to sing the catchy word-puzzle Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious in Mary Poppins, or It’s a Small World, originally written for Disneyland. According to Time magazine, It’s a Small World may be the most publicly performed song in history. 






A musical family
Born in New York to Russian Jewish immigrants, the Sherman brothers were exposed to music early, as their father Al Sherman was a gifted songwriter who wrote for Tin Pan Alley. Their mother Rosa was a Vaudeville singer. 
Moving to Beverly Hills as a family in 1937, Richard went to Beverly Hills High School and learned piano, flute and piccolo. 
He graduated with classmate André Previn, who coincidentally was nominated for an Oscar for best musical score adaptation for My Fair Lady in 1965, the same year the Sherman Brothers were nominated for best original music score for Mary Poppins. They both won. 
Richard was known as an inspirational and upbeat entertainer. Recordings of him at the piano show an ability to entertain as well as write.

The Sherman brothers’ relationship was rocky. They also faced the wrath and exacting standards of Australian-born PL Travers in writing the score for Mary Poppins. 
Richard wrote more of the music and sat at the piano, but there were porous boundaries between lyricist and composer. Most of their repertoire was created while directly working for Walt Disney, but they were released from contract to allow them to compose for other films, including Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, one of many of their movie musicals which serve as allegories for the American Dream, American exceptionalism and progress.

American optimism
Many Sherman scores, for both Disney and others, hold a firm place in the canon, including Winnie the Pooh (1977), The Parent Trap (1961), The Aristocrats (1970), The Magic of Lassie (1978) and more. 
Their sound world is as accessible to children as adults, with recognisable strophic structures and expert rhyming, making their songs instantly memorable. Their music and lyrics are optimistic, tonal, within a singable range for most amateurs, and use perfectly balanced hooks. 

Their quirky aphorisms avoid the tendency to become sickly sweet. Because of the clever turn of phrase of many of their lyrics, singers such as Tony Bennett and even Christopher Walken have recorded them. 
The Shermans and Alan Menken are melodic genii, principally responsible for the “Disney sound” of the middle period between the 1960s and 2010s. Together they created a sound world that represented peak American optimism, from a period when gorgeous melodic arcs were highly valued neo-romantic ideals.  

The Shermans were also eclectic in their prolific composing of more than 200 works, using diverse influences from Tin Pan Alley, jazz, Dixieland, barbershop, blues, tango, parlour songs and even operetta.  
Walt Disney’s favourite Sherman song was Feed the Birds from Mary Poppins. Sherman told a story of being called to Disney’s place on a Friday afternoon to sing the song around the piano. 

The Sherman sound, from the invented superlative Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious, to the simple and affecting tale of a bird woman, to the aspirational beauty of magical Hushabye Mountain, create an imagined world of beauty and possibility.  
In this way, the Shermans were the perfect match for Disney’s image of aspirational America, musicalising stories of infectious optimism and creative zeal that defined the mid-century United States. 
In 2015, talking to movie publication Collider, Richard summed up their holistic compositional approach, one that can inspire the next generation of musical composers:

Walt Disney was a story man, and he knew that we were thinking story. That’s why he dug us so much […] We always thought about the story. That was more important than any words and any music. That’s all it’s about.

Australiaâs new consent campaign gets a lot right. But consent education wonât be enough to stop sexual violence,https://theconversation.com/australias-new-consent-campaign-gets-a-lot-right-but-consent-education-wont-be-enough-to-stop-sexual-violence-230956,3023388,"Health policy, Health, Sexual consent, consent education, Health in the news","
The Australian government has recently launched Consent Can’t Wait, a campaign focused on supporting sexual consent communication between adults and young people.
Advertisements will run on television, in cinemas, online and on social media, encouraging adults to check their understanding of consent. Videos pose questions such as “how do I bring up consent?”, “do I have to ask every time?” and “what if we’ve been drinking?”, before finally asking “if we don’t know the answers, how will our kids?”.

The campaign website provides a range of resources designed to equip adults to have conversations with each other, and with young people.
While this campaign has a lot of positives, consent education won’t be enough to stop sexual violence on its own.





What motivated this campaign?
In launching this campaign, the government has cited statistics showing one in five women and one in 16 men have experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. One in two women and one in four men have experienced sexual harassment in their lifetime.
These statistics don’t account for the experiences of trans and gender diverse people. In Private Lives 3, a survey on the health and wellbeing of queer people in Australia, 64% of non-binary people, 55% of trans men and 42% of trans women had experienced sexual assault.
A lack of understanding of sexual consent is considered a major reason why sexual violence occurs. One report noted almost half of people living in Australia who were surveyed were confused about what consent actually means for sex and intimacy. 
In a separate survey, more than one in four young people in Australia agreed that “when a man is very sexually aroused, he may not realise that the woman doesn’t want to have sex”. 

What the campaign does well
The campaign is a welcome update to the infamous milkshake video in 2021, which formed part of the Respect Matters campaign. This video was heavily criticised for its confusing messages and trivialising of consent. 
Conversely, Consent Can’t Wait takes a simple, direct and carefully worded approach that’s not only directed at young people, but at adults as well.
This is perhaps what makes the campaign unique. Most consent campaigns have largely focused on supporting young people, but can forget that sexual violence occurs in all age groups, and that adults play an important role in shaping young peoples’ understandings and attitudes towards consent. 
Adults are often asked to lead conversations around consent with young people. However, they may not have a good understanding of the issue. Many adults today in their 30s and older are unlikely to have had a comprehensive sex education that included conversations about consent during their formative years. Being an adult who has sex does not automatically equate to a good understanding of consent.
The campaign includes guides on how adults should talk to each other and how they should talk to young people about consent. It includes interactive activities that unpack common questions (“what is sexual consent?”) and bust myths about consent such as “you only need to check for consent the first time”. 
There’s also a “community kit” that includes flyers for spreading awareness, and a resource hub with links to sexual health and sexual violence services. Guides are translated into more than 15 languages while specific guides are provided for First Nations communities.
The campaign includes diverse representations of people with disabilities, queer couples, and people across different ages and cultural and ethnic backgrounds. 

Consent education is a start, but not enough
While the campaign should be commended for its simple and straightforward messages about consent, there’s one crucial aspect missing.
Sexual violence is often not just the result of a lack of consent. For decades, research has shown sexual violence is rooted in misogyny (hatred of or prejudice against women), femmephobia (hatred of femininity), queerphobia (fear and hatred of LGBTIQA+ people), and a sense of sexual entitlement. 
It’s tempting to think these issues don’t persist in 2024. But the rise of incel culture (men who feel entitled to sex with women but angry they cannot get it), and the continued influence of people such as Andrew Tate (who believes women belong in the home and are a man’s property, among other things), all point to broader societal issues. 
The recent incident in Melbourne where boys were caught with derogatory lists rating the sexual attractiveness of girls in their school similarly highlights the currency of these problems.

We know most sexual violence is perpetrated by men, against other men, women, and trans, non-binary and gender diverse people. Australian Institute of Health and Welfare data shows 2.5 million people who have experienced sexual violence reported a man as the perpetrator, compared to 353,000 who said it was a woman. Meanwhile, 2 million women said their assailant was known to them, as opposed to a stranger. 
In Private Lives 3 84% of LGBTIQA+ participants who experienced sexual violence in the previous 12 months reported a cisgender man as the perpetrator.
While power is discussed in the campaign, I believe this discussion is vague, less central than it should be, and ignores the role of gender and culture.
Understanding and respecting consent are different things
A recent study I conducted with colleagues showed young men and women in Australia do understand consent, but don’t necessarily apply this knowledge in the moment. Rather, a range of other factors impact how they might navigate consent (or choose not to) in sexual situations. 
Other research has shown men do understand what consent is, the issue is actually respecting it.
Educating about consent is important. This campaign, alongside mandated consent education in schools, is overall a very good start.
But it will not necessarily reduce sexual violence if we don’t recognise that the heart of sexual violence isn’t necessarily about a lack of understanding. It is, and continues to be, about a perceived entitlement to bodies.

Replanting trees can help prevent devastating landslides like the one in PNG âÂ but itâs not a silver bullet,https://theconversation.com/replanting-trees-can-help-prevent-devastating-landslides-like-the-one-in-png-but-its-not-a-silver-bullet-231055,3023387,"Papua New Guinea, Deforestation, Landslides, Environment, Reforestation","
More than 2,000 people are now feared dead after a huge landslide buried a village in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, Australia’s nearest neighbour. Rescue efforts are being stymied by the fact the land is still sliding and moving. The disaster has cut the main road into the mountainous region. 
PNG’s mountainous highlands are home to millions of people, living at least 1,500 metres above sea level. People here rely on food gardens, often cultivated on hillslopes. Landslides are common. 
As Australia and other nations send aid to help the rescue effort and survivors, attention will turn to whether fatal landslides can be prevented. 
Could deforestation be the cause? It’s possible. But there are many other potential causes. In 2018, for instance, a large earthquake triggered many landslides across the highlands. 
Still, the example of Nepal gives some hope. Nepal was once heavily deforested, and suffered many lethal landslides. Mass reforestation has helped – but it must be coupled with other measures.  

What makes land slide?
Mountains are not solid blocks of rock. They’re composed of a mix of clay, silt, sand, gravel and boulders of various sizes and shapes, all held together by resistive forces, especially friction. 
Gravity is constantly pulling this mass downward, but resistive forces prevent it from collapsing, in a constant tug of war. When the resistive force becomes weaker than gravity, the hillside becomes unstable. 
There are different ways the slope of a mountain can collapse, but landslides are one of the most common. Worldwide, these disasters cause significant loss of life and damage to homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. 
What has to happen for gravity to win out over friction? Usually, it involves water. 
When water sinks into the side of a hill or mountain, it acts as a lubricant. It can also build up pressure, which reduces friction. Earthquakes and volcanic activity can also cause landslides by shaking the slope, making a landslide more likely. 

Can our activities make landslides more common?
Landslides are common in mountainous regions with heavy rainfall and where earthquakes and volcanic activities are frequent. Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Nepal, PNG and Italy all frequently experience landslides. 
Landslides are often triggered naturally. But our activities can make them more likely. The risk will rise in regions where climate change is driving substantial increases in rainfall. 
When we cut into slopes to build roads or houses, we can make landslides more likely – especially if we don’t improve drainage to funnel infiltrating water away. Mining can also increase landslide risk. 
To safely build infrastructure or mines in steep terrain means relying on structural measures such as a good drainage system, retaining walls, and other stabilising structures. 
That’s in the ideal world. Structural measures are expensive. In poorer countries, development is often done without these safeguards, putting lives and livelihoods at risk.

What about trees? When we cut down trees or irrigate hillsides, we can load the dice for more landslides.
Deforested areas are particularly vulnerable to landslides. When tree roots die, they leave behind soil pipes (macropores), small tunnels able to channel water from the surface deep into the ground. This significantly boosts the pressure groundwater is under, triggering more landslides. 
Studies show landslides continue to increase for a few years after deforestation, indicating the decay of tree roots, decline and root strength and the formation of macropores.
Trees on more gentle slope help stabilise the soil, especially against shallow landslides. That’s because their roots go deep, anchoring movable surface soil to more stable substrates. Trees also cut how much water gets into the soil by drinking it. 
But on steep slopes, trees can actually cause landslides, due to the added weight. And if a deep landslide is looming, tree roots won’t stop it. 
What can we do?
The first step is to keep people away from high risk areas. Many countries have undertaken surveys of mountainous areas to assess where the highest landslide risk is. 
It’s very hard and expensive to stabilise a slope after a landslide. It’s far better to avoid one.
For shallow landslides, the most feasible prevention is to keep forest cover widespread across the catchment.
Forests are important – but they’re not a silver bullet. 
A study in Nepal found extensive deforestation peaked between 1985 and 1990. Landslides began increasing between 1995 to 2003, indicating a delayed impact. A different study from Nepal reported a reduction in the surface area affected by landslides following reforestation. 
The effect is noticeable – but not huge. New Zealand research has found landslides are less common in forests than in pastures for areas with similar rainfall, and showed reforestation cut landslide sediment rates by at least 10% decrease within the first five years. Research on the Spanish Pyrenees found reforestation moderately reduced landslide occurrences. 
So is it worth replanting trees on denuded slopes? On milder slopes, it will make a difference in cutting landslide risk. But this technique takes years until the roots grow big enough, it can’t be used on steeper slopes – and it won’t stop the really big landslides.

Swiftonomics: what we can learn from Singapore multiplying millions from Taylor Swiftâs Eras tour,https://theconversation.com/swiftonomics-what-we-can-learn-from-singapore-multiplying-millions-from-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-228289,3023301,"Economic recession, Taylor Swift, World recession, Concerts","
When Taylor Swift picks a country to “Shake It Off”, it might help the nation’s economy to shake off the impacts of the global economic slowdown.
Since the World Bank announced the possibility of a global recession in its 2022 report, fears that the world will experience an extended period of economic contraction has plagued many countries. 
In January, the World Bank predicted the global economy would slow down for the third consecutive year in 2024. According to some economists, this makes a recession likely in the near future.
The impact of a global recession may vary from one country to another. But with disrupted supply chains and cash flow, the common symptoms and effects are hikes in unemployment and poverty rates, rising prices, reduced profit, and default for businesses.





American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift may have an answer to address these challenges. Beyond micro and macroeconomics, business students should be studying Swiftonomics – especially the economic impact of Swift’s current global tour.
The record-breaking Eras tour
Eras is Swift’s sixth concert tour. It began in March 2023 and is scheduled to conclude in December 2024. Consisting of 152 shows performed across five continents, critics have given it highly positive reviews for its grand aesthetic design and immersive ambience.
The tour is already the highest-grossing music tour ever and the first to reach US$1 billion in total ticket gross sales globally. More impressively, that total did not yet include the sales of the Eras Tour film, which reportedly made US$250 million, plus another US$200 million in merchandise sold during the tour.
What does this tour have to do with the global recession?
Music and the multiplier effect
First-year economics students would tell you that the impacts of Swift’s tour were not limited to the fantastic figures outlined above. In fact, her tour could result in a multiplier effect that could benefit an economy. 
Simply defined, the multiplier effects measure how a change in economic activity, like investment or spending, will have a spill-over amplified impact on the various sectors and the total output of a country. 
This phenomenon is not new. The concerts by other big names in music, such as those of UK-based band Coldplay and South Korea’s boy-group BTS, have also resulted in such effect. However, the scale of Swift’s tour has been considerably stronger compared to others.       
For example, let’s look at the multiplier effects of her March concerts in Singapore.

Swift’s GDP-boosting visit to Singapore
While raising controversy for signing a deal to be the only stop on Swift’s Southeast Asia Eras tour, Singapore enjoyed a significant boost from hosting six concerts in the country. This is even after accounting for the reportedly US$18 million payments for exclusively hosting the concerts in South-East Asia.
Here are some interesting statistics. Swift’s concerts, from March 1 to 9 2024, increased the overall tourism-related bookings for the country by an astonishing 275% compared to the same period two weeks later. 
Meanwhile, Singapore’s inbound flights and accommodation bookings rose by 186% and 462% respectively during the week of the concert.
What did that mean for the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth?
Economists told Bloomberg they estimated Singapore’s Swift concerts would add around SG$300–$400 million (US$222–$296 million) to the country’s first-quarter GDP. 
The additional boost was on top of the reported year-on-year growth of Singapore of 2.7% in the first quarter of 2024.
That latest growth spurt topped the 2.2% expansion of GDP in the last quarter of 2023 – thanks to the multiplier effect in Singapore’s tourism sector ignited by the American pop star. 
This staggering impact of the the six-day concert for Singapore follows the success of the tour in the US last year. 
One research company estimated the US economy may have enjoyed a multiplier boost of US$5 billion from the 52 shows in the country last year, thanks to concertgoers spending an average of $1,300 each. Swift even earned a mention in a US Federal Reserve report, which noted:

Despite the slowing recovery in tourism in the region overall […] May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the pandemic, in large part due to an influx of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the city.

What can other nations learn?
Singapore’s strategic move to secure exclusive concerts was a “creative” expansionary fiscal policy. 
Traditional expansionary fiscal policies commonly involve a reduction in taxes and/or an increase in government spending. Keynesian economists, who believe in the need for government intervention to stimulate and amplify economic activity during a recession, see these fiscal weapons as necessary.
Critics, however, argue that the multiplier effects of these policies could suffer from time lags. Consequently, fiscal policy may only affect the economy several months or, sometimes, several years after it is initiated.
But Singapore’s experience from Swift’s tour told a different story.
Sure, on the one hand, the economy went through a short period of demand-pull inflation, with prices of some goods and services rising substantially. But while the six sold out concerts were on, various sectors of Singapore’s economy – including hotels, airlines and restaurants – benefited from a much-needed post-COVID-19 boost.
What Singapore did with Swift provides a universal lesson that all countries could learn. 
When strategically planned, a targeted spending policy involving big names in the entertainment industry can create a substantial multiplier effect. Such an effect can help an economy in a downturn bounce back.

What causes landslides? Can we predict them to save lives?,https://theconversation.com/what-causes-landslides-can-we-predict-them-to-save-lives-230968,3023300,"Earthquakes, Natural disasters, Geoengineering, Landslides, Geoscience, Disaster","
A devastating landslide struck several remote villages in the mountainous Enga province in Papua New Guinea late last week.
While it is too early for official confirmation, estimates place the death toll between 690 and 2,000 people, with thousands more missing. That only a few bodies have been recovered serves as a tragic reminder of the destructive power of these events.
The ongoing search and rescue operations have proven challenging. As often with landslides, secondary slides and rock falls are hampering efforts in the search zone. There’s also a lack of access to heavy digging machinery, and roads need to be cleared or repaired for assistance and equipment to arrive.
Even more critically, it is difficult to locate potential survivors, as landslides carry away buildings and their occupants in an unpredictable manner. What causes these devastating events and why are they so sudden and unpredictable?





What causes landslides?
Landslides happen when the pull from gravity exceeds the strength of the geomaterial forming the slope of a hill or mountain. Geomaterials can be as varied as rocks, sand, silt and clays. 
Then, part of this slope starts sliding downhill. Depending on where the slope fails, the material sliding down can be just a few cubic metres or a few million cubic metres in volume.
Why do slopes fail? Most natural landslides are triggered by earthquakes or rainfall, or a combination of both. 
Earthquakes shake the ground, stress it and weaken it over time. Rainwater can seep through the ground and soak it – the ground is often porous like a sponge – and add weight to the slope. This is why PNG is so prone to landslides, as it sits on an active fault and is subjected to heavy rainfalls. 
Another adverse effect of water is erosion: the constant action of waves undercuts coastal slopes, causing them to fail. Groundwater can also dissolve rocks within slopes.
Humans can (and do) cause landslides in several ways, too. For example, deforestation has a negative impact on slope stability, as tree roots naturally reinforce the ground and drain water out. Also, mine blasts produce small earthquake-like ground vibrations that shake slopes nearby. 

Why can’t we predict landslides?
It’s very difficult to predict and mitigate landslide risk effectively. The Enga landslide and the thousands of deadly and costly landslides occurring every year worldwide suggest so. Even in Australia – the flattest continent in the world – home insurance policies don’t tend to cover landslide risk for a simple reason: this risk is difficult to estimate. 
So what would it take to warn people of a coming landslide? You would need a prediction for earthquakes and rainfall, in addition to a perfect knowledge of the slope-forming geomaterial. 
Under our feet, geomaterials may include multiple, entangled layers of various kinds of rocks and particulate materials, such as sand, silt and clays. Their strength varies from a factor of one to 1,000, and their spatial distribution dictates where the slope is likely to fail. 

To accurately assess the stability of the slope, a three-dimensional mapping of these materials and their strengths is needed. No sensor can provide this information, so geologists and geotechnical engineers must deal with partial information obtained at a few selected locations and extrapolate this data to the rest of the slope.
The weakest link of the chain – such as an existing fracture in a rock mass – is easily missed. This is an inevitable source of uncertainty when trying to predict how much material might slip.
We do know that the larger the volume of a landslide, the farther its runout distance. But it’s hard to gauge the exact size of a landslide, making predictions of runout distances and safe zones uncertain.
The question of “when will a landslide will occur” is also uncertain. Mechanical analysis enables us to estimate the vulnerability of a slope in a particular scenario, including earthquake magnitude and distribution of groundwater. But predicting if and when these triggers will happen is as “easy” as predicting the weather and seismic activity – a difficult task. 
Unfortunately, all the money in the world can’t buy accurate landslide predictions – especially in remote parts of the world.

"Cate Blanchett, like most Australians, thinks sheâs middle class. An expert on class explains why that matters",https://theconversation.com/cate-blanchett-like-most-australians-thinks-shes-middle-class-an-expert-on-class-explains-why-that-matters-230958,3023299,"Cate Blanchett, Wealth, Neoliberalism, Working class, Class, Wealth inequality, Victoria Beckham, Middle class, Privilege","
Cate Blanchett, whose net worth is estimated at A$140 million, has described herself as “middle class” – unwittingly unleashing a furore.
How could someone in a highly powerful, elite echelon of society who owns multiple properties across Australia and the UK claim to be middle class, especially at a time when the wealth gap between “the top” and “the bottom” has become so stark? 
Recent 2024 research shows that in Australia, nearly half of all wealth is held by the top 10% of households –  who hold 15 times the wealth of the lowest 60%.
Yet Blanchett’s claim is not unusual. Studies have long shown that Australians tend to overly claim to be middle class when ranked by income, regardless of whether they fall below or above “the middle”. 
Some have suggested this is because identifying as middle class sits comfortably with being “average” or “ordinary”. Others find it supports moralised neoliberal agendas of self-responsibility. All are widely valorised narratives in Australian public life, routinely used for political gain.
What is ‘middle class’ anyway?
Class categories were once tied to occupations. But recent Australia-based studies, like those in the UK, argue the reality of class breakdown in Australia is much more complicated than the three categories we’re used to – working class, middle class and upper class.
Yes, class is based on employment and the income this produces – but it is also generated by other forms of economic capital (increasingly through family wealth and assets), as well as our combinations of social capital and cultural capital. 

In everyday life, however, more established ways of thinking and feeling about class continue to carry weight. The language of three classes, but especially the terms “working class” and “middle class”, remains pervasive and meaningful to many in Australia, regardless of its accuracy. 
To further complicate things, people move between different classed worlds over their lives, in ways that are complex. There may be a class difference between the family environment we grew up in (our class origin) and the world we live in as an adult (our class destination). 
This might be the case, for example, for people whose lives are significantly mobile, or for those who have experienced upward social mobility through higher education. 
Some people continue to claim the class identity of their childhood, despite inhabiting a differently classed world as an adult. Class identification is deeply personal and complicated. The class we feel we belong to (the one that first shaped who we are and how we think and behave) can be at odds with our objective class reality – and with the opportunities, resources and security now available to us.
This becomes a problem when those in positions of significant wealth and power continue to believe they represent the majority – which Blanchett does not. Blanchett’s class origin may have been middle class, but her class destination – the one she currently inhabits within the 1% – is certainly not.
Why does it matter?
We tend to locate our class identity in relation to the others in our immediate social surroundings. Our perception of wealth inequality comes from our day-to-day experiences.
If our partner, friends, workmates and social networks are all comprised of highly wealthy individuals, and if our children’s schools are segregated enclaves of wealth and privilege (as the kind attended by Australia’s economic, political and cultural elite – including the children of Hollywood actors – often are), we will likely see our own experiences as ordinary. Read: middle class. 

This kind of class misidentification in turn supports meritocratic ideals that dictate hard work and talent will ultimately lead to success – though ample evidence shows this is not the case. 
This shifts attention from the unequal distribution of resources in society, which contributes significantly to who gets ahead. It encourages us to instead focus on individuals as sole architects of their own success or failure. 
This is especially rife in the arts, a profession that lauds the downplaying of privilege.
Research on wealth inequality also suggests the more unequal a society is, the less likely its citizens are to take notice of that inequality. People on either side of the divide become unable to perceive the extent of the gulf that separates their lives from others. As this gap increases, other people’s lives become harder to view, understand and empathise with.
This perception gap is one reason why some advocate for more opportunities to enable people to study, live and work alongside others from different class backgrounds. 
Confronting class
Blanchett’s claim to being middle class is not unique. A similar furore erupted in the UK last year when Victoria Beckham infamously claimed, in the documentary Beckham, to be from a “working class” family. 

Husband David Beckham, listening from another room, demanded off-camera: “Be honest!”. He then challenged her (several times) to reveal: “What car did your dad drive you to school in?”. Her expression shifted to one of both frustration and embarrassment, as she admitted “in the ‘80s, my dad had a Rolls Royce”. 
British people often downplay or selectively obscure their class background, too. However, they are more likely to misidentify as working class, rather than middle class. Meanwhile, the chance for people from poorer households in the UK to “move up the social ladder” has become much harder. 
As Australia confronts increasing wealth inequality, the downplaying of wealth and privilege among elites – or the failure to see it at all –  becomes all the more untenable.

Rethinking roads as public spaces â what NZ cities can learn from Barcelonaâs âsuperblockâ urban design,https://theconversation.com/rethinking-roads-as-public-spaces-what-nz-cities-can-learn-from-barcelonas-superblock-urban-design-226601,3023298,"Cities, New Zealand, Urban planning, Urban design, Public space, Car use, superblocks, Better Cities, Science + Environment","
New Zealand is one of the most car-centric countries in the world. With the exception of the capital Wellington, New Zealand cities have some of the highest rates of car ownership globally. 
In central Auckland, roads occupy 18% of all land and a further 25% of land is car parks. 
Ask people what “public space” means and they probably won’t mention roads because these are assumed to be for cars. 
But New Zealanders pay for roads, especially road maintenance, through fuel taxes, road user charges and general taxation. So is there a way road space could be used differently?





Superblock neighbourhoods
One city that has worked to reinvent the concept of public space is Barcelona. Over 30 years, the city has developed “superblocks” – neighbourhoods where traffic speeds are reduced and through-traffic is limited. 
There is no reduction in access for cars or emergency services. It’s more a redefinition of the bus and car network, coupled with lower speed limits in certain areas. 

By reducing the priority given to cars in some parts of the city, Barcelona has released public land for a range of uses such as play, business, markets and active travel such as walking and cycling. Significant benefits include lower air pollution and noise, increased green space, more physical activity, fewer premature deaths and higher economic activity.
It is true that cities in Europe are older and denser than in Oceania. But during a recent visit to New Zealand, the inventor of superblocks, urban ecologist Salvador Rueda, outlined how they could work in cities such as Christchurch and Auckland and the benefits this could deliver. 
Here are his suggestions, in order of how easy they would be to implement.
1. Stop hoping for a silver bullet
New Zealand has a tendency to favour big infrastructural projects to change cities. Whether it is a new tunnel under Wellington, as proposed by the coalition government, or a light-rail system for Auckland, such projects imply the only solutions are big and expensive. 
But because cities are networks, there are often far cheaper options that can be implemented with careful analysis and reallocation of space. This shift in thinking and planning needs to happen first. 
2. Use bus networks to identify superblocks
The most climate-efficient, readily available and flexible system to reduce car use in cities is the bus network. 
However, organising the bus network in a grid of orthogonal routes that follow perpendicular lines is key. Radial systems leave large gaps of unserviced areas. An orthogonal grid means the city is served equally by buses no matter how large it becomes. 
Buses are also frequent and fast. They can easily outcompete cars, and high frequencies can also mitigate any concerns about having to transfer between buses. 

3. Better management of on-street parking
Free parking does not actually exist. The question is rather who is paying for it – the user or everyone. In private developments, the user pays in some way. But this is not the case for public spaces. 
In Japan, people have to prove they have access to a local parking space before they can buy a car. 
But generally, on-street car parking represents a major subsidy to drivers through the use of public space that could be put to other uses. Car parking creates large areas of paved roads that reduce social and business opportunities. 
Any revenue gains from parking charges are a false economy, especially when enforcement is weak. 
4. Redirect traffic
At the moment, New Zealand cities are designed for unlimited through traffic, with unfettered access across the city. 
As much as possible, the city’s public spaces should be divided into those for movement across the network and those which are for mixed uses for all, including pedestrians and those with mobility needs. 
In New Zealand, the One Network Framework facilitates this, but few streets seem to actually prioritise people. In Barcelona, in the streets which are for movement, car traffic is aligned with the bus transit, using a one-way system and speed limits of 30km/h. 
This comes with many benefits, including less congestion and safer streets. 
On the inside of Barcelona’s superblocks, speeds are reduced to 10km/h to allow for different activities.  
5. Make targeted investments in public spaces
If the experience of Barcelona demonstrates anything, it is that the creation of public space underwrites a whole range of commercial (as well as social) activity that uncovers latent demand.
In other words, the creation of public space in our cities supports small businesses and commercial activity because people shop and buy coffee, and cars don’t. 
6. Encourage density
The New Zealand government acknowledges that boosting density is critical to addressing the housing shortage. Denser housing offers multiple benefits, including lower emissions, reduced infrastcructure costs and better physical and mental health. 
Systemic planning changes to enable density are required to maximise the benefits of a superblock approach to development. But a final reason for considering superblocks is their low cost. They don’t require investment in hard infrastructure, demolition of buildings or massive development. They represent very low-tech urbanism. 
To mitigate any risk and allay any fears, superblocks can be trialled as low-cost temporary interventions. At a time of necessary cost savings, perhaps New Zealand cities should embrace low-cost, high-impact change.

"âPlay well, win wellâ: new Australian sports chair Kate Jenkins faces challenges and opportunities",https://theconversation.com/play-well-win-well-new-australian-sports-chair-kate-jenkins-faces-challenges-and-opportunities-230770,3023199,"Gender equality, Sports, Australian Sports Commission, Sport governance, Sport and Society","
The Australian Sport Commission (ASC) has appointed Kate Jenkins as its new board chair, replacing Josephine Sukkar, who was the first female chair appointed to the ASC board in 2021. 

As a lawyer and governance expert, Jenkins boasts a wealth of experience in sport, equality and cultural change – she was previously director of the Carlton Football Club and chair of Play by the Rules, an organisation dedicated to sport participation, equality and inclusion.
Jenkins was an ambassador for the 2020 T20 Women’s World Cup and the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup and participated in the Australian Human Rights Commission’s Independent Review of Gymnastics Australia in 2021. 
Jenkins, a former Australian sex discrimination commissioner, is an advocate for human rights, gender equality and inclusiveness and believes the ASC has a national leadership role for all sports, and for all Australians. 





So, what should Jenkins prioritise in her new role? 
What is Jenkins’ vision with the ASC?
The ASC is the national government agency responsible for supporting and investing in all sport at all levels. It was responsible for more than A$222 million in sport-related grants last financial year. 
Jenkins’ vision is for sport “to be safe, fair, accessible and inclusive for everyone. And with every athlete supported to reach their full potential.” 
Two key ASC strategic focuses are “Play Well” and “Win Well” – Jenkins has already highlighted these two priority areas. 
“Play Well” focuses on participation in sport by all Australians and safe, fair and inclusive opportunities for all Australians participating in sport. The strategy encourages lifelong involvement, building connections and transforming culture.  
“Win Well” is the high performance sport strategy. It highlights the support and resources allocated to Australia’s elite athletes.  
By winning well, the ASC believes Australia’s athletes can inspire a nation. At its heart is a commitment to performance with focus on a culture of care, prioritising integrity, fair play and pride.   

What else must Jenkins and the ASC prioritise?
The new chair of the ASC must find a way to boost women’s sport participation, develop elite female sport pathways and ensure sustainability in women’s sport at the highest level. 
There are signs things are improving. Following the Women’s World Cup, football NSW’s female registrations increased by 34%. 
Australia now has seven professional women’s sport leagues and young girls can now see future opportunities in elite sport – not just in soccer but in traditionally male-dominated sports. 
In the AFL, almost one in five registrations are now women. The NRL says women’s participation is the fastest growing area of the sport, while Cricket Australia has also recorded a 26% rise in female participation in 2023. 
Despite the rise of women’s sporting leagues though, most female athletes still face a gender pay gap.
Australia’s female cricketers take home an average of $55,000 for competing in the Women’s National Cricket League. However, top female cricketers also competing in WBBL can earn retainers as high as $420,000. 
AFLW players now earn around $50,000, with an increase to $82,000 expected by the end of 2027. The minimum wage for Australian Super Netball players is $46,000, with the average wage recently rising to $89,211. 
In contrast, male national cricketers earn on average $951,000, while male AFL players earn an average $450,000.
Jenkins, previously an Australian sex discrimination commissioner, should also be well placed to fight the discrimination and harassment prevalent in women’s sport.
Women participating in male-dominated sports often receive harassment – both in real life and online. They often have to put up with inappropriate comments about their appearance, gender identity or sexual orientation. 
Cultural change is needed within sport clubs if younger generations of females want to participate more regularly in these sports. 
A brighter future?
Jenkins believes women’s sport is at a turning point and attributes much of this to the Matildas’ historic World Cup result. 
The Matildas united the nation at the 2023 World Cup in Australia. Despite not making the final, history was made – the quarterfinal against France was watched by 7.2 million Australians, which was the biggest television audience for a sports event in more than two decades.  
The legacy of that World Cup is seen by some as new era for women’s sport in Australia – Jenkins believes the tournament is an example of how gender equality can benefit everyone.
However, she acknowledges there is still some opposition to women’s sport in Australia but examples like the Matildas’ success create positive conversations and change. 
Jenkins has a mission to advance gender equality on the sports field and is well positioned to address the current inequalities women in sport face. After her appointment to the ASC, she said:

“If we can harness the opportunities ahead of us, I’m confident Australia’s sporting system can be the world’s best.”

There is a long way to go to address the inequalities in women’s sport in Australia but with Jenkins at the helm, the future is looking brighter.

Mad Max: Fury Road was a pioneering portrayal of disability. Furiosa is a letdown,https://theconversation.com/mad-max-fury-road-was-a-pioneering-portrayal-of-disability-furiosa-is-a-letdown-229126,3023198,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Film, Screen, George Miller, Mad Max, Disability coverage","
Furiosa, the latest instalment of the Mad Max franchise, has arrived a decade after the release of George Miller’s groundbreaking reboot Fury Road (2015). 
As we demonstrated in our 2019 book, Miller and the ongoing Mad Max saga used representations of disability, gender, trauma and mythology to propel the films into cult status, global markets and international fandom, while sensitive to shifting sensibilities within the zeitgeist.
Max (Mel Gibson) in the earlier films reflected an era of generation X machismo. Furiosa in Fury Road, played by Charlize Theron, represented a more inclusive form of heroism – a postfeminist celebration of teamwork. 
The overtaking of a male action hero with a disabled female protagonist was a widely celebrated feature of Fury Road, and something we had never seen before in action cinema. 





Furiosa promised to give us the impairment origin story and explain the experiences that shaped Furiosa to become the strong, disabled female leader in Fury Road. 
Unfortunately, aside from some clever references to Max’s own madness origin story, the film’s focus on Furiosa’s amputation exploits disability, and closes down the related commentary and critique previously expanded in each progressive Mad Max film.

Haunted by the past
Miller and his co-writers have consistently presented the movies’ principal antagonists as survivors of deeply traumatic events.
In the 1979 first film, Max recognises his emerging, vengeful mania, saying spending too much time on the road will make him “a terminal crazy”. 
As he spends more time in the Wasteland, becoming that terminal crazy, characters in the second and third films chide him for maintaining his antisocial grief and vengeful rage. 

As Max further withdraws from society, the films chronicle patriarchy at its extremes, and the breakdown of post-apocalyptic society. Max’s inner traumas are reflected on his body as physical impairments. 
By Fury Road, Max (Tom Hardy) is artfully shown suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, repeatedly haunted by guilt and experiencing hallucinations. 
Powerfully, also in Fury Road, the cause of Furiosa’s disability is neither revealed nor spoken of. Her lack of one arm is never presented as a particular struggle or disadvantage. The focus is on her heroism and leadership; her emotions range from raw fury to compassion.

Fury Road’s prequel, Furiosa (now played by Anya Taylor-Joy) barely registers emotion at all: part survival mechanism, but also post-trauma mutism and hypervigilance. 
A brief dream montage of her traumatic experiences ends with a startled fight or flight reflex. But there is little to empathise with.
The film promised to offer an insight into Furiosa’s motivations. By focusing mostly on the lead up to the amputation – instead of developing her inner world – audiences are deprived of an opportunity to really understand this character. 

Furiosa launches herself into increasingly dangerous situations and threats to her body and life, teasing the inevitable: when will she lose her arm?  
Compared with the complex representations of disability, gender and leadership in Fury Road, in which Furiosa’s strength and evolving leadership is communicated through her emotive facial expressions and empathy for others, this Furiosa remains one-dimensional. 
This is such a departure from the innovation in disability and gender representation in Fury Road. The film obscures more than reveals.
A narrative prosthesis
Cultural disability theorists David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder write of a tendency in film and popular literature to use disability as a “narrative prosthesis”:

as a crutch upon which narratives lean for their representational power, disruptive potentiality, and analytic insight.

When disability is used as a narrative prosthesis, the story focuses on disability as a tragedy, or on overcoming the tragedy of an impaired body.
Furiosa’s impairment origin story is the crutch upon which this film relies. This focus comes at the expense of representations of disability and trauma explored throughout the previous films’ subtexts.

Miller’s critique of the rising road toll in the 1970s inspired the first two films. 
As the series progressed, the films provided commentary on catastrophe, capitalism and survivalism, showcasing tyrannical leaders who forgo the health of the planet and its people for the sake of profit and power. 
Fury Road turned its lens towards disabled and traumatised characters – there is rarely a scene without them. The characters with disabled and ageing bodies hold the promise for a new beginning, suggesting alternatives to violent, despotic overlords.

For the most part in Furiosa, these broader narratives are missing. The drama hinges on the possibility the next scene could be the moment Furiosa will lose her arm. 
To regress from a complex representation of disability and gender in Fury Road to an exploitative fascination with how and when Furiosa acquires this impairment – rather than who it allowed her to become – is disappointing. 
Fury Road asked us to expand our understanding of disability. Furiosa feeds on voyeuristic anticipation.
Furiosa’s end titles are interrupted with brief iconic clips from Fury Road. Such arresting imagery only serves to emphasise the former film’s potency and resonance at the expense of the latter.

"No, sugar doesnât make your kids hyperactive",https://theconversation.com/no-sugar-doesnt-make-your-kids-hyperactive-229107,3023175,"Diet, Nutrition, ADHD, Sugar, Dopamine, Kids health, Hyperactivity, Disability coverage","
It’s a Saturday afternoon at a kids’ birthday party. Hordes of children are swarming between the spread of birthday treats and party games. Half-eaten cupcakes, biscuits and lollies litter the floor, and the kids seem to have gained superhuman speed and bounce-off-the-wall energy. But is sugar to blame? 
The belief that eating sugary foods and drinks leads to hyperactivity has steadfastly persisted for decades. And parents have curtailed their children’s intake accordingly. 
Balanced nutrition is critical during childhood. As a neuroscientist who has studied the negative effects of high sugar “junk food” diets on brain function, I can confidently say excessive sugar consumption does not have benefits to the young mind. In fact, neuroimaging studies show the brains of children who eat more processed snack foods are smaller in volume, particularly in the frontal cortices, than those of children who eat a more healthful diet. 
But today’s scientific evidence does not support the claim sugar makes kids hyperactive.





The hyperactivity myth
Sugar is a rapid source of fuel for the body. The myth of sugar-induced hyperactivity can be traced to a handful of studies conducted in the 1970s and early 1980s. These were focused on the Feingold Diet as a treatment for what we now call Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a neurodivergent profile where problems with inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity can negatively affect school, work or relationships. 
Devised by American paediatric allergist Benjamin Feingold, the diet is extremely restrictive. Artificial colours, sweeteners (including sugar) and flavourings, salicylates including aspirin, and three preservatives (butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene, and tert-Butrylhdryquinone) are eliminated.
Salicylates occur naturally in many healthy foods, including apples, berries, tomatoes, broccoli, cucumbers, capsicums, nuts, seeds, spices and some grains. So, as well as eliminating processed foods containing artificial colours, flavours, preservatives and sweeteners, the Feingold diet eliminates many nutritious foods helpful for healthy development.
However, Feingold believed avoiding these ingredients improved focus and behaviour. He conducted some small studies, which he claimed showed a large proportion of hyperactive children responded favourably to his diet. 

Flawed by design
The methods used in the studies were flawed, particularly with respect to adequate control groups (who did not restrict foods) and failed to establish a causal link between sugar consumption and hyperactive behaviour. 
Subsequent studies suggested less than 2% responded to restrictions rather than Feingold’s claimed 75%. But the idea still took hold in the public consciousness and was perpetuated by anecdotal experiences.
Fast forward to the present day. The scientific landscape looks vastly different. Rigorous research conducted by experts has consistently failed to find a connection between sugar and hyperactivity. Numerous placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated sugar does not significantly impact children’s behaviour or attention span.
One landmark meta-analysis study, published almost 20 years ago, compared the effects of sugar versus a placebo on children’s behaviour across multiple studies. 
The results were clear: in the vast majority of studies, sugar consumption did not lead to increased hyperactivity or disruptive behaviour. 
Subsequent research has reinforced these findings, providing further evidence sugar does not cause hyperactivity in children, even in those diagnosed with ADHD.
While Feingold’s original claims were overstated, a small proportion of children do experience allergies to artificial food flavourings and dyes. 
Pre-school aged children may be more sensitive to food additives than older children. This is potentially due to their smaller body size, or their still-developing brain and body. 
Hooked on dopamine?
Although the link between sugar and hyperactivity is murky at best, there is a proven link between the neurotransmitter dopamine and increased activity. 
The brain releases dopamine when a reward is encountered – such as an unexpected sweet treat. A surge of dopamine also invigorates movement – we see this increased activity after taking psychostimulant drugs like amphetamine. The excited behaviour of children towards sugary foods may be attributed to a burst of dopamine released in expectation of a reward, although the level of dopamine release is much less than that of a psychostimulant drug.
Dopamine function is also critically linked to ADHD, which is thought to be due to diminished dopamine receptor function in the brain. Some ADHD treatments such as methylphenidate (labelled Ritalin or Concerta) and lisdexamfetamine (sold as Vyvanse) are also psychostimulants. But in the ADHD brain the increased dopamine from these drugs recalibrates brain function to aid focus and behavioural control.

Why does the myth persist?
The complex interplay between diet, behaviour and societal beliefs endures. Expecting sugar to change your child’s behaviour can influence how you interpret what you see. In a study where parents were told their child had either received a sugary drink, or a placebo drink (with a non-sugar sweetener), those parents who expected their child to be hyperactive after having sugar perceived this effect, even when they’d only had the sugar-free placebo. 
The allure of a simple explanation – blaming sugar for hyperactivity – can also be appealing in a world filled with many choices and conflicting voices.
Healthy foods, healthy brains
Sugar itself may not make your child hyperactive, but it can affect your child’s mental and physical health. Rather than demonising sugar, we should encourage moderation and balanced nutrition, teaching children healthy eating habits and fostering a positive relationship with food. 
In both children and adults, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting free sugar consumption to less than 10% of energy intake, and a reduction to 5% for further health benefits. Free sugars include sugars added to foods during manufacturing, and naturally present sugars in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.
Treating sugary foods as rewards can result in them becoming highly valued by children. Non-sugar rewards also have this effect, so it’s a good idea to use stickers, toys or a fun activity as incentives for positive behaviour instead.
While sugar may provide a temporary energy boost, it does not turn children into hyperactive whirlwinds.

"Norway, Spain and Ireland have recognised a Palestinian state ",https://theconversation.com/norway-spain-and-ireland-have-recognised-a-palestinian-state-whats-stopping-nz-230851,3023052,"New Zealand, Gaza, Hamas, Israel-Palestine, Benjamin Netanyahu, Winston Peters, Oslo Accords, Two-state solution, Occupied Territories, Occupied West Bank, Palestinian statehood","
Norway, Spain and Ireland will formally recognise the state of Palestine today (May 28). While 143 of the 193 United Nations member states already recognise Palestine, this is a significant moment – and leaves New Zealand in an even smaller group of countries yet to follow suit.
The latest move is important because it makes a clear statement that members of the international community can no longer wait for the Middle East peace process to conclude before recognising Palestinian statehood. 
New Zealand – along with a number of former colonial powers such as the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan and Italy – continues to withhold recognition. Foreign minister Winston Peters has said it is a matter of “when, not if”, but also that recognition will depend on certain conditions.
These include holding elections (although this was never a requirement for recognising China), and the vague standard of “serious negotiations between both Israel and Palestinians, including over the political authority of a future Palestinian state”.





This position represents the longstanding view that statehood was to be an incentive to completing peace negotiations. But the latest developments signal a shift away from that. As the Norwegian foreign minister told media: 

We used to think that recognition would come at the end of a process […] Now we have realised that recognition should come as an impetus, as a strengthening of a process.


The tattered ‘road map’ for peace
That process is often referred to as the “two-state solution” and has for decades had the support of many countries, including New Zealand. In essence, it would mean Israeli and Palenstininan states would be established on the land where Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories now stand.
The exact borders and relationships between the two states would be ironed out in the peace process. This would involve each state’s leaders making appropriate concessions, developing trust and goodwill, and bringing their people with them to a sustainable peace. 
(The Northern Irish Peace Process, culminating in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, is often given as an example of how this might succeed.)
The high point of progress in developing a two-state solution came with the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993. This was not an agreement, but a “roadmap” to developing one. 
Within a few years however, violence on both sides – including Hamas attacks against civilians and the 1995 assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by a Jewish opponent of the peace process – made it impossible to sustain that progress. 

Recognition of Palestine, not Hamas
When Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu first came to power in 1996, the two-state solution was left to wither on the vine. 
It has been moribund ever since, with Israeli leaders prevaricating over progressing the idea, while increasing the levels of military and civil oppression faced by Palestinians. Netanyahu remains implacably opposed to Palestinian statehood.
New Zealand has supported the two-state solution for decades, and has not been afraid to challenge Israel. During its time on the UN Security Council  (2015-16), New Zealand voted for Resolution 2334, which condemned Israeli settlement building in the Occupied Territories.
Because the US abstained, the resolution passed. It stands as one of the high-water marks of international opposition to Israel’s illegal occupation policies (which are in direct contravention of the Geneva Conventions). 
Officially recognising a Palestinian state, then, would be in line with New Zealand’s past positions and actions. It would be one part of a bigger push to achieve a peaceful two-state solution, and it would not mean recognition of Hamas (or any other party). 
‘Soft power’ can be effective
Recognition is not, as the Israeli government has portrayed it, a “reward” for the horrendous Hamas attacks of October 7. But it would be an acknowledgement that the peace process has stagnated and a different approach must be tried. 
In the short term, the practical effect of recognising a Palestinian state would be minimal. Palestine’s representative in Canberra would present their credentials in Wellington, and relations with Palestine would continue as normal. 
The long-term effects may be more significant, however. If Palestine is a state, then the two-state solution has its vital components. It will then be time to focus on how those two states will coexist in peace.
Small states can often feel powerless at times of international upheaval, and in some respects (particularly when hard military power is being used) they are. But there are still levers of “soft power” available. These become more effective when used collectively in conjunction with other small states. 
The actions of Norway, Spain and Ireland present a unique opportunity for New Zealand to be in the vanguard of the development of a lasting peace in Israel and Palestine.

How the Middle Ages are being revisited through Indigenous perspectives,https://theconversation.com/how-the-middle-ages-are-being-revisited-through-indigenous-perspectives-219558,3022962,"Racism, Medieval, Reading, Far right, Middle Ages, Medieval history, Anglo Saxons, White supremacy, Newfoundland, Critical race, Turtle Island, Settler colonialism, medievalism","
The seemingly fantastical world of the Middle Ages has held western popular culture in fascination since (at least) its nostalgic reimagining by Victorian antiquarians.
European medieval imagery or narratives, partly popularized in the early to mid-20th century, with works like J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, still permeates popular culture. “The medieval” is used to evoke both magical stories for all ages, and mature stories featuring senseless violence.
Unfortunately, there is also a sinister side to our collective love affair with knights and dragons of yore. White nationalist and alt-right groups have taken up the stories, imagery and histories of what is popularly imagined in the West as the Middle Ages to visualize the existence of a homogeneous white Europe, whether imagined as fully Christian or neo-pagan Europeans.

      Understanding the Crusades from an Islamic perspective









Revisiting the meaning of the Middle Ages, and how medieval imagery and narratives are appropriated and understood today, is therefore necessary for an accurate snapshot of the European and global historical period, and its misuses. 
As a scholar raised as a member of the Métis Nation in B.C. (though my current documentation is insufficient for citizenship), some of my work has been concerned with what it means to decolonize medieval studies. With literature professor Elizabeth Edwards, I have examined how medieval studies can gain insight from Indigenous worldviews and perspectives.
Here, I consider the impact of white supremacy on historical and contemporary scholarly and popular understandings of the Middle Ages, and focus on how scholars are shifting the narrative with critical race and Indigenous approaches.

White nationalism
Critical race scholars like Dorothy Kim and Eduardo Ramos have highlighted the colonial histories of medieval studies and its associated myths and stereotypes.
As critical race literature scholar Matthew X. Vernon notes in The Black Middle Ages: Race and the Construction of the Middle Ages, white supremacist theorists have seen medieval England as “available for being imaginatively constructed as an era of racial purity and military subjugation on ‘foreign peoples.’” Such “extrapolations of the Middle Ages” have served to “racializ[e] bodies and then fi[x] horizons of expectations for what a race could achieve.”
Medievalist scholars Mary Rambaran-Olm and Erik Wade note that some American and English writers rebranded “Anglo-Saxon” to include false narratives around white racial superiority. This use has perpetuated false ideas of what it means to be “native” to Britain, and by extention to claim special “white” belonging and rights in settler colonial societies. 
Indigenizing approaches to the Middle Ages
The idea of the Middle Ages is arguably tightly interwoven with settler colonial ideology. Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars with a decolonial focus have begun to understand the European medieval period through global historical and Indigenous perspectives. 
How have Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars approached the Middle Ages from a decolonial lens?
1. Red Reading
“Red Reading,” a form of literary analysis that uses Indigenous approaches and methodologies to read non-Indigenous texts, was first coined by Jill Carter (Anishinabek), and simultaneously developed by Scott Andrews (Cherokee). 
In my own work, I read texts like The Book of Margery Kempe, a fifteenth-century text of a mystic’s life and personal relationship with Jesus Christ, to understand how authors incorporated elements of oral storytelling into their written work, not as a an accident of progress but as a purposeful, artistic choice.

2. Examining settler colonialism emerging in premodern history
Tarren Andrews (Bitterroot Salish), a literature scholar, revisits origins of colonial narratives. Her scholarship examined male heterosexual and patriarchal control over women in the English poem of The Wife’s Lament written around the 10th century, and how this cultural impulse would manifest in the sexism of the 1867 Indian Act.

      Disenfranchising Indigenous women: The legacy of coverture in Canada




She’s focussed on legal and literary artifacts from before 1100 from the North Atlantic alongside stories or documents from Turtle Island (North America).
3. Deconstructing Norse contact on Turtle Island
The field of medieval studies had long considered itself immune to the need for decolonial work, as it imagined itself to exist prior to European contact with Indigenous societies beyond Europe — other then a brief interaction between the Indigenous peoples of Newfoundland and the Norse.
This contact was immortalized in the archaeological site of L’Anse-Aux-Meadow in Newfoundland, now a national historic site, and sagas (such as the Greenlander Saga and the Saga of Erik the Red). Literature scholars like Geraldine Heng have examined interactions in the saga to interrogate how notions of race were developed and depicted in pre-modern times. 
Christopher Crocker, a Qualipu Mi’kmaw scholar of medieval and modern Icelandic literature, notes how the fascination with Norse contact dominates Newfoundland tourism and historical research — at the expense of pre-colonial Indigenous studies and representation.

4. How colonial rhetoric imagined Indigenous Peoples as “medieval”
Some scholars, like sociologist Daniel S. Goh or post-colonial medievalist scholar Helen Young, examine how discussing and framing Indigenous people as “medieval” (backward) has been key to colonial projects. Medievalism was used to justify racist colonial projects as necessary to allow the “medieval” Indigenous societies to “catch up” with supposedly superior European societies.
5. Indigenous adaptations of medieval literature
English literature scholar Jonathan Hsy’s Antiracist Medievalism highlights how Indigenous poets have appropriated medieval poetry styles, as part of decolonial literary movements. 
Hsy showcases the work of Osage medievalist, Carter Revard, who studied, translated and wrote in the Old English Riddle style. This style was a popular form, written from the perspective of an object, such as a sword or book, to reveal itself to the audience. 

Alongside his translations, Revard wrote some riddles from the point of view of an eagle fan or birch canoe, as an act of reclaiming both halves of his identity — the Osage and the European.
Shifting the public perception
Work related to decolonizing the study of the Middle Ages is beginning to take root. 
I hope this thinking, and the thinking of other scholars, can inform what is taught in classrooms. This can help students carry forward new understandings as they both create and consume medieval-themed images, games, videos and narratives.

Why is the Gaza war tearing us apart?,https://theconversation.com/why-is-the-gaza-war-tearing-us-apart-229996,3022874,"Gaza, Antisemitism, Islamophobia, Student protests, Doxing, Cancel culture, Israeli-Palestine Conflict, Gaza war","
The recent Gaza war protests and counterprotests roiling universities around the world have attracted vocal supporters and critics alike. Protesters have occupied buildings on campuses from Los Angeles to Paris to Melbourne, and police have intervened to break up encampments, at times with violent altercations. 
Clashes between pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian protesters have also become commonplace outside universities, while people on both sides of the debate have been subjected to doxing, harassment and abuse.
US President Joe Biden warned of a “ferocious surge” of antisemitism in the United States, while the Australian government has established an inquiry to report on racism at universities. Hate crimes are on the rise across Europe, as well.
What’s going on? Why has this issue over the war in Gaza – compared to all the other controversies and crises we face – become so fraught, and the debate so toxic?

Major ethical concerns
There are some straightforward reasons why the Gaza war attracts attention and activism.
Both sides (Hamas and the Israel Defense Forces) have committed acts that prompt allegations of the most serious moral charges imaginable: genocide, slaughter, war crimes. These are atrocity crimes: among the worst things humans can do to one another.
Israel and Palestine also have a long and complex history. Any given act can – and perhaps must – be viewed in the context of prior provocations, offers and grievances. There are also starkly different readings of that history.
The immediate future raises enormous moral stakes, as well. For its part, Israel aims to safeguard itself from subsequent atrocities and to free its hostages. 
For Palestinians, the stakes are almost unimaginably high. There is the civilian cost of the current military incursion into Rafah. There is the unthinkable humanitarian cost if famine or disease becomes worse. And there is the massive damage to Gaza itself as a place that can sustain a human population after the war is over.
Lastly, multicultural and immigrant nations, like the US, Australia and others, have many people with personal ties to one side or the other. People who see the conflict through very different lenses might live, work and play alongside each other in our communities. This makes conflicts even more likely.




      Read more:
      What is it about Gaza? Wars are raging around the world, so why are young people so passionate about this one?




Our current moment
But must all this add up to charges of intimidation, provocation and racism? Three features of our current cultural moment are likely causing these disagreements to become even more vitriolic:

We are all politically active, and publicly so. Ordinary people and organisations routinely take public moral stands on charged issues. Even the absence of a public statement can be notable.
There is a pronounced social concern for vulnerable groups and their safety, especially when minorities face identity-based discrimination and oppressive speech.   
There is an increased willingness, super-charged through social media, to use “social punishment” against opposing views. This can include efforts at cancelling, disrupting, shouting down, blackballing, doxing, lawfare, public shaming through vitriolic abuse and other efforts to inflict harms on perceived wrongdoers. Some partisans even feel justified in threatening violence.

These three features have become interconnected in our current climate. Seeing society as an us-and-them struggle between good and evil can drive people to take public stances, and to socially punish the perceived oppressors.
These features were apparent in movements against systemic racism (such as the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of George Floyd’s death in police custody) and sexism (the #Metoo movement). And we are seeing it now with the Gaza war, as well.

What’s different this time?
A crucially different feature of the current controversy is that both sides can and do freely employ these features against each other. 
This is a change. Previously, the main opposition to the above three cultural features came from centre-left critics who largely agreed with the goals of progressive movements, but disagreed with their methods. 
For example, Yasha Mounk, author of The Identity Trap, acknowledged the need for a reckoning on racial justice, but criticised the use of public shaming and cancel culture. As he himself observed, this ambivalence about the ends and means of progressive movements often prevented critics like him from mounting assertive, full-frontal attacks on their opponents.
In contrast, the Israel-Gaza conflict sees both sides wielding uncompromising language, concepts and methods against each other. Both Jews and Palestinians have faced undeniable bigotries (antisemitism, Islamophobia), and have responded by publicly calling out this racism.
A social system in which people take such public moral stances, target identity-based oppression and employ social punishment against perceived wrongdoers can be relatively stable, provided there is widespread agreement about who counts as oppressors and the oppressed. 
But in the current controversy, both sides can plausibly claim they are the persecuted minority. After all, the Jewish people had a long history of persecution even before the horrors of the Holocaust, and Israel has been surrounded by countries violently opposed to its existence since its inception. 
And compared to Israel’s military might, the Palestinians plainly suffer from systemic oppression and deadly violence. This will seem especially true to those who see Israel as an oppressive “settler colony” – invaders aiming to permanently replace the existing locals.
Once there is direct disagreement about which party counts as the oppressed group, conflicts can quickly escalate. 
Each side is righteously sensitive to any perceived hate speech from the other, but unwilling to limit their own punitive strategies or inflammatory language. After all, why should the victims have to curb their language and methods to suit the oppressors? 

Tit-for-tat escalations
Using social punishment to achieve policy goals can also sometimes shade into coercive force. 
At low levels, disruptive and rule-breaking protests can help publicise a political message and communicate its importance. But the more disruptive a protest becomes, it takes on the unvarnished threat of a protection racketeer: we will make running your operations impossible unless you submit to our demands.
Worse still, once one side steps outside the bounds of normal rules and expectations — such as through disruptive or intimidating protests or attempts to get others fired —the other side righteously retaliates, trading accusations of racism and bigotry. 
There is no longer just a conflict, but a conflict about the conflict.
Language, power, humanity
And this perhaps leaves us with the final ethical concern. Even if it is right, sometimes, to judge people based on their group membership, and to be sensitive to the role of systemic power, people are individuals, too. It still matters how each individual is treated, not as a place-holder for a group, and not as responsible for the group’s sins.
Just because a person might be in the right politically doesn’t mean that what they are doing for their cause is permissible morally. 
There are no easy answers here. In a multicultural and pluralistic country, we can’t prevent others having different views, and we can’t shy away from the sharp disagreements those differences will create. 
But we can at least remember we are all human, and put limits on intimidating, haranguing, ostracising and threatening others, even as we tolerate their rights to protest and criticise the things we hold most sacred.

"Cost of living: if you canât afford as much fresh produce, are canned veggies or frozen fruit just as good?",https://theconversation.com/cost-of-living-if-you-cant-afford-as-much-fresh-produce-are-canned-veggies-or-frozen-fruit-just-as-good-229724,3022873,"Diet, Nutrition, Health, Cost of living, Consumer health, Fruit and vegetables, Fresh produce","
The cost of living crisis is affecting how we spend our money. For many people, this means tightening the budget on the weekly supermarket shop.
One victim may be fresh fruit and vegetables. Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) suggests Australians were consuming fewer fruit and vegetables in 2022–23 than the year before.
The cost of living is likely compounding a problem that exists already – on the whole, Australians don’t eat enough fruit and vegetables. Australian dietary guidelines recommend people aged nine and older should consume two serves of fruit and five serves of vegetables each day for optimal health. But in 2022 the ABS reported only 4% of Australians met the recommendations for both fruit and vegetable consumption. 
Fruit and vegetables are crucial for a healthy, balanced diet, providing a range of vitamins and minerals as well as fibre.





If you can’t afford as much fresh produce at the moment, there are other ways to ensure you still get the benefits of these food groups. You might even be able to increase your intake of fruit and vegetables.
Frozen
Fresh produce is often touted as being the most nutritious (think of the old adage “fresh is best”). But this is not necessarily true.
Nutrients can decline in transit from the paddock to your kitchen, and while the produce is stored in your fridge. Frozen vegetables may actually be higher in some nutrients such as vitamin C and E as they are snap frozen very close to the time of harvest. Variations in transport and storage can affect this slightly. 
Minerals such as calcium, iron and magnesium stay at similar levels in frozen produce compared to fresh.
Another advantage to frozen vegetables and fruit is the potential to reduce food waste, as you can use only what you need at the time.

As well as buying frozen fruit and vegetables from the supermarket, you can freeze produce yourself at home if you have an oversupply from the garden, or when produce may be cheaper. 
A quick blanching prior to freezing can improve the safety and quality of the produce. This is when food is briefly submerged in boiling water or steamed for a short time.
Frozen vegetables won’t be suitable for salads but can be eaten roasted or steamed and used for soups, stews, casseroles, curries, pies and quiches. Frozen fruits can be added to breakfast dishes (with cereal or youghurt) or used in cooking for fruit pies and cakes, for example.
Canned
Canned vegetables and fruit similarly often offer a cheaper alternative to fresh produce. They’re also very convenient to have on hand. The canning process is the preservation technique, so there’s no need to add any additional preservatives, including salt. 
Due to the cooking process, levels of heat-sensitive nutrients such as vitamin C will decline a little compared to fresh produce. When you’re using canned vegetables in a hot dish, you can add them later in the cooking process to reduce the amount of nutrient loss. 
To minimise waste, you can freeze the portion you don’t need.
Fermented

Fermentation has recently come into fashion, but it’s actually one of the oldest food processing and preservation techniques. 
Fermentation largely retains the vitamins and minerals in fresh vegetables. But fermentation may also enhance the food’s nutritional profile by creating new nutrients and allowing existing ones to be absorbed more easily.
Further, fermented foods contain probiotics, which are beneficial for our gut microbiome.
5 other tips to get your fresh fix
Although alternatives to fresh such as canned or frozen fruit and vegetables are good substitutes, if you’re looking to get more fresh produce into your diet on a tight budget, here are some things you can do.
1. Buy in season
Based on supply and demand principles, buying local seasonal vegetables and fruit will always be cheaper than those that are imported out of season from other countries. 
2. Don’t shun the ugly fruit and vegetables
Most supermarkets now sell “ugly” fruit and vegetables, that are not physically perfect in some way. This does not affect the levels of nutrients in them at all, or their taste.

3. Reduce waste
On average, an Australian household throws out A$2,000–$2,500 worth of food every year. Fruit, vegetables and bagged salad are the three of the top five foods thrown out in our homes. So properly managing fresh produce could help you save money (and benefit the environment).
To minimise waste, plan your meals and shopping ahead of time. And if you don’t think you’re going to get to eat the fruit and vegetables you have before they go off, freeze them. 
4. Swap and share
There are many websites and apps which offer the opportunity to swap or even pick up free fresh produce if people have more than they need. Some local councils are also encouraging swaps on their websites, so dig around and see what you can find in your local area. 
5. Gardening
Regardless of how small your garden is you can always plant produce in pots. Herbs, rocket, cherry tomatoes, chillies and strawberries all grow well. In the long run, these will offset some of your cost on fresh produce. 
Plus, when you have put the effort in to grow your own produce, you are less likely to waste it.

"How do I keep my fruit, veggies and herbs fresh longer? Are there any âhacksâ?",https://theconversation.com/how-do-i-keep-my-fruit-veggies-and-herbs-fresh-longer-are-there-any-hacks-226763,3022872,"Fruit, Food production, Vegetables, Kitchen science, Herbs, Produce","
We all know fresh produce is good for us, but fruit, vegetables and herbs have a tendency to perish quickly if left uneaten.
This is because even after harvesting, produce from living plants tends to continue its biological processes. This includes respiration: producing energy from stored carbohydrates, proteins and fats while releasing carbon dioxide and water vapour. (Ever found a sprouting potato in your pantry?)
On top of that, fresh produce also spoils easily thanks to various microbes – both harmless and ones that can cause disease, called pathogens. 
Simply chucking things in the fridge won’t solve the problem, as different types of plants will react differently to how they’re stored. So, how can you combat food waste and keep produce fresh for longer? Fortunately, there are some helpful tips.





Freshness and quality begin at the farm
Farmers always aim to harvest produce when it’s at an optimal condition, but both pre-harvest and post-harvest factors will affect freshness and quality even before you buy it.
Pre-harvest factors are agricultural, such as climatic conditions, soil type and water availability. Post-harvest factors include washing and cleaning after harvesting, transportation and distribution, processing and packaging, and storage.
As consumers we can’t directly control these factors – sometimes the veggies we buy just won’t be as good. But we can look out for things that will affect the produce once we bring it home.
One major thing to look out for is bruised, wounded or damaged produce. This can happen at any stage of post-harvest handling, and can really speed up the decay of your veggies and fruit. 
Moisture loss through damaged skin speeds up deterioration and nutrient loss. The damage also makes it easier for spoilage microbes to get in.
To wash or not to wash?
You don’t need to wash your produce before storing it. A lot of what we buy has already been washed commercially. In fact, if you wash your produce and can’t get it completely dry, the added moisture could speed up decay in the fridge. 
But washing produce just before you use it is important to remove dirt and pathogenic bugs.
Don’t use vinegar in your washing water despite what you see on social media. Studies indicate vinegar has no effect on lowering microbial loads on fresh produce.
Similarly, don’t use baking soda. Even though there’s some evidence baking soda can remove pesticide residues from the surface of some produce, it’s not advisable at home. Just use plain tap water.

Location, location, location
The main thing you need is the correct type of packaging and the correct location – you want to manage moisture loss, decay and ripening.
The three main storage options are on the counter, in the fridge, or in a “cool, dry and dark place”, such as the pantry. Here are some common examples of produce and where best to put them.
Bananas, onion, garlic, potatoes, sweet potato and whole pumpkin will do better in a dark pantry or cupboard. Don’t store potatoes and onions together: onions produce a gas called ethylene that makes potatoes spoil quicker, while the high moisture in potatoes spoils onions.
In fact, don’t store fruits such as apples, pears, avocado and bananas together, because these fruits release ethylene gas as they ripen, making nearby fruits ripen (and potentially spoil) much faster. That is, unless you do want to ripen your fruits fast.
All leafy greens, carrots, cucumbers, cauliflower and broccoli will do best in the low-humidity drawer (crisper) in the fridge. You can put them in perforated plastic bags to retain moisture but maintain air flow. But don’t put them in completely sealed bags because this can slow down ripening while trapping carbon dioxide, leading to decay and bad smells.
Some fruits will also do best in the fridge. For example, apples and citrus fruits such as oranges can keep fresh longer in the fridge (crisper drawer), although they can stay at room temperature for short periods. However, don’t store watermelon in the fridge for too long, as it will lose its flavour and deep red colour if kept refrigerated for longer than three days. 
Most herbs and some leafy vegetables – like celery, spring onions and asparagus – can be kept with stems in water to keep them crisp. Keep them in a well-ventilated area and away from direct sunlight, so they don’t get too warm and wilt.

Fight food waste and experiment
Don’t buy too much. Whenever possible, buy only small amounts so that you don’t need to worry about keeping them fresh. Never buy bruised, wounded or damaged produce if you plan to keep it around for more than a day.
“Process” your veggies for storage. If you do buy a large quantity – maybe a bulk option was on sale – consider turning the produce into something you can keep for longer. For example, banana puree made from really ripe bananas can be stored for up to 14 days at 4°C. You can use freezing, blanching, fermentation and canning for most vegetables.
Consider vacuum sealing. Vacuum packaging of vegetables and berries can keep them fresh longer, as well. For example, vacuum-sealed beans can keep up to 16 months in the fridge, but will last only about four weeks in the fridge unsealed.
Keep track. Arrange your fridge so you can see the produce easily and use it all before it loses freshness.
Experiment with storage hacks. Social media is full of tips and hacks on how best to store produce. Turn your kitchen into a lab and try out any tips you’re curious about – they might just work. You can even use these experiments as a way to teach your kids about the importance of reducing food waste. 
Grow some of your own. This isn’t feasible for all of us, but you can always try having some herbs in pots so you don’t need to worry about keeping them fresh or using up a giant bunch of mint all at once. Growing your own microgreens could be handy, too.

"Future Made in Australia will boost sustainable growth and create jobs as far as it goes, but it doesnât go far enough",https://theconversation.com/future-made-in-australia-will-boost-sustainable-growth-and-create-jobs-as-far-as-it-goes-but-it-doesnt-go-far-enough-230536,3022871,"Manufacturing, Carbon emissions, Supply chains, Net zero emissions, Critical minerals, Battery technology, Future Made in Australia Act","
The shift towards net zero emissions and greater international competition have created new opportunities for clean energy industries – poised to shape the global economy in the coming decades.
To harness these opportunities, the government has developed a long-term strategic initiative called the Future made in Australia program.
This program, first flagged by the government last month with a total $22.7 billion investment over the next decade, aims to attract private investment into priority areas while supporting a net zero policy.
The government has identified five priority industries – renewable hydrogen, critical minerals processing, green metals, low carbon liquid fuels and clean energy manufacturing.





It has targeted these sectors, which will receive tax incentives and other benefits, to become a global leader in the move to net zero, boosting the broader economy and industrial sectors.
Major challenges
Despite the positive intentions, there are major challenges.
These include ongoing implementation, bringing in new local and global partners and gaining local community support to build essential infrastructure such as wind turbine and power transmission lines.
Other challenges include complex mining operations of critical minerals in remote areas, huge upfront capital costs, problems transporting hydrogen and cost competitiveness of alternative manufacturing locations. 
The current budget allocation to be spent over the next decade for the five critical sectors is significant. However, to achieve the intended outcome, the program needs to be expanded.
Expanding priorities
While the critical mineral sector is already a priority, expanding the program to create a large-scale battery supply chain where critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt are essential, would make Australia more competitive.
A sovereign battery supply chain would help secure a renewable energy storage system and contribute to producing electric vehicles.
In line with this, the government has developed a National Battery Strategy. However, the focus of this should be extended to include exports and installation at residential and business premises.

Given concerns about supply chain disruption, especially at a time of increased global tensions, other sectors including the health product manufacturing and food processing sectors should also be prioritised.
Developing these industries, which are highly vulnerable to disruption, is important for community well being and economic security.
Becoming more self-sufficient
Since the COVID pandemic, Australia has been experiencing dire shortages of critical medicines including blood thinners, antibiotics and hormone replacement therapy medication.
By extending the Future Made program to health products, Australia could boost its domestic production of critical medicines and protect against future shortages. This would also increase Australia’s export opportunities.
Australia could step up exports to Asia by using its free trade agreements with China, Japan, Korea and other countries in the region.
Developing the local food manufacturing and processing industry should also be a priority to protect against supply disruptions already experienced as a result of the Russia/Ukraine war, climate-fuelled weather disasters and the pandemic.
The food industry accounts for the bulk of Australia’s manufacturing jobs, highlighting its importance in the economic resilience of the country.
With the correct government policies, the food and grocery sector could be doubled by 2050, increasing employment by 54% to 427,000 people.
Reducing emissions
Agriculture should also be included in the priority list. This sector alone was responsible for 16.8% of the country’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020-21.
It is therefore necessary to ensure freight transport and manufacturing of farm inputs, such as energy and water, are sustainable to achieve the net zero target. Green technologies should replace the existing carbon-generated equipment and machinery in the agriculture sector.

The sector could also be carbon neutralised using microalgae-based technologies. Furthermore, microalgae-based technologies can reduce carbon emissions and pollution for many other manufacturing industries with significant emissions.
Therefore, the development and large-scale implementation process of green and microalgae-based technologies should also be included in the program.
The benefits of Future Made in Australia
The Future Made in Australia program’s potential benefits include job creation and skill development, strengthening local industries, securing supply chains and keeping them independent, long term economic growth and cutting carbon emissions.
Under the existing priorities numerous jobs are expected to be created in manufacturing, especially in the renewable energy sector. While job growth will be particularly strong in central and northern Queensland which have been selected for renewable energy and hydrogen hubs, jobs will also grow in other parts of the country.
With an allocation of $91 million for developing a clean energy workforce, $55.6 million for building women’s career program and $178.6 million for skills and employment supports for regions in transition, the program is expected to contribute heavily to job creation in clean energy and advanced manufacturing sectors. 
New investment and tax incentives will help develop new industries and boost existing ones including hydrogen and critical minerals production. The incentives will make hydrogen projects commercial sooner and develop green energy manufacturing capabilities to strengthen the renewable energy sector.
Recent research ranked Australia third in the world for renewable electricity prices in 2030 and 2050, showing its competitiveness in the global arena and potential for economic resilience and growth.
Australia is likely to benefit from exporting renewable hydrogen to its international trading partners including Japan, which is planning to import one million tonnes annually, and the European Union which will import 10 million tonnes by 2030.
The exporting cost of various hydrogen carriers to Japan is lowest for Australia compared to its competitors. 
Similarly, Australia could leverage its huge capacity to produce iron and bauxite to become one of the world’s cheapest places for green metals.
How Future Made could be even better
The Future Made program targets five priority industries: renewable hydrogen, critical minerals processing, green metals, low carbon liquid fuels and clean energy manufacturing.
Expanding the program to include other critical industries such as agriculture, food processing and health manufacturing and their supply chains will enhance Australia’s economic resilience and security by generating more jobs and ensuring a seamless supply of essential products during future disruptions.

Buried kelp: seaweed carried to the deep sea stores more carbon than we thought,https://theconversation.com/buried-kelp-seaweed-carried-to-the-deep-sea-stores-more-carbon-than-we-thought-228888,3022870,"Climate change, Biodiversity, Seaweed, Environment, Phytoplankton, Carbon storage, Kelp, Great Southern Reef, kelp forests, Marine heatwaves","
Deep in the ocean lies the world’s largest active carbon reservoir, which plays a pivotal role in buffering our planet’s climate. Of the roughly 10 billion tonnes of carbon we emit each year, about 3 billion tonnes are taken up and stored in the oceans. 
When we consider natural carbon storage in the deep oceans, we generally focus on phytoplankton. Trillions of these microscopic plants live in the surface waters all across the oceans. When they die, they sink to the ocean floor, transporting carbon to the depths.
But there’s a missing piece of the puzzle. Our two new studies show coastal vegetation such as seaweed forests are more important to natural carbon storage than we thought. Around 56 million tonnes of carbon in the form of seaweed is carried into the deep ocean each year. 
For carbon to be stored for hundreds of years, it has to enter slow cycling pools of carbon in the deep ocean. But most seaweeds only grow in shallow coastal seas. How can they get there? 

Rivers in the sea
For decades, deep sea explorers have reported surprising findings. Pieces of seaweed and other coastal plants appear where they shouldn’t be. 
Fragments of seaweed are often caught in deep-sea trawls, or recorded by submarines and underwater robots during surveys of the ocean floor. Seaweed DNA has been detected in deep sea water and sediments in all of the world’s oceans, as deep as 4 kilometres down and up to 5,000 km from the closest seaweed forest.
But how can seaweeds travel that distance? 

Our team discovered part of the answer. Seaweed can be carried by large “underwater rivers”, which flow from coastal waters along the seafloor across the continental shelf and into the deep.
These currents form when localised cooling causes cold dense coastal water to rapidly sink below warmer offshore surface waters. The dense water slides down the slope of the seafloor, following the topography like a river, and carrying with it large quantities of seaweed to deeper areas. 
In Western Australia, these flows of seaweed and coastal vegetation towards the deep ocean happen most during colder months, when conditions allow these underwater rivers to form. During these months, storms often hit coastal waters, ripping up seaweed and filling the water with seaweed fragments.

These underwater rivers are a well-documented phenomenon in Australia. But are these ocean currents transporting seaweed and their carbon elsewhere? 
We worked with an international team of scientists to find out. To do so, we tracked seaweed from coastal waters to the deep ocean using advanced ocean models.
The hidden role of seaweed forests in oceanic carbon export
Our findings were clear. Seaweed forests do, in fact, transfer substantial amounts of carbon to the deep ocean in many parts of the world. 
This phenomenon is particularly high in the kelp forests of Australia’s Great Southern Reef, which stretches 8,000 km from Kalbarri in Western Australia to Coolangatta in Queensland. 
The seaweed forests of the United States, New Zealand, Indonesia and Chile are also carbon transport hotspots. 
While phytoplankton still sink vast amounts of carbon, our discovery suggests the plants of the coastal ocean transfer more carbon than we thought.
Mangroves, salt marshes and seagrass all contribute to these flows of carbon, but seaweed forests are really big contributor. These forests are made up of large brown algae such as kelp and rockweed species, which form extensive hidden forests. Seaweed forests – such as Tasmania’s disappearing giant kelp forests – are the largest and most productive coastal ecosystems on the planet. 
Globally, these forests cover an area twice the size of India, and fix as much carbon during their growth as the northern forests of Canada – nearly 1 billion tonnes a year. 
Of this carbon, our research suggests between 10 and 170 million tonnes makes it to the deep ocean every year.

A threatened ecosystem
Many of us don’t give seaweed much thought. But underwater seaweed forests play a vital role. These forests give shelter and home to huge numbers of fish and other marine species. They improve water quality and boost biodiversity. And now we know they help store carbon for hundreds of years. 
Like many other ecosystems, underwater forests are at risk. Hotter seas from climate change, coastal development, pollution and overfishing have pushed seaweed forests to die off faster than most other coastal ecosystems. 
Their fate has worsened in recent decades. The ocean is getting hotter, faster, bringing with it longer lasting and more frequent marine heatwaves. 

In Tasmania, the heating ocean has brought new species to seaweed forests, which now have subtropical fish species and voracious sea urchins. These urchins are chewing through the state’s kelp forests. 
In Western Australia, a severe marine heatwave struck in 2011, wiping out kelp forests along 100 km of coastline. These forests have not recovered. 
When we lose seaweed forests, we lose their natural ability to transfer carbon to the deep ocean. But their loss also threatens the other species who rely on them, and the half a trillion dollars of value they provide to us. 
We should think of conserving seaweed forests in the same way we do forests on land. Scaling up restoration where forests have been lost is vital to ensure these unsung plants can keep supporting us – and help store carbon.

"Who really was Mona Lisa? More than 500 years on, thereâs good reason to think we got it wrong",https://theconversation.com/who-really-was-mona-lisa-more-than-500-years-on-theres-good-reason-to-think-we-got-it-wrong-220666,3022869,"History, Art, Art history, Leonardo da Vinci, Mona Lisa, Renaissance art, Visual art and design","
In the pantheon of Renaissance art, Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa stands as an unrivalled icon. This half-length portrait is more than just an artistic masterpiece; it embodies the allure of an era marked by unparalleled cultural flourishing. 
Yet, beneath the surface of the Mona Lisa’s elusive smile lies a debate that touches the very essence of the Renaissance, its politics and the role of women in history.
A mystery woman
The intrigue of the Mona Lisa, also known as La Gioconda, isn’t solely due to Leonardo’s revolutionary painting techniques. It’s also because the identity of the subject is unconfirmed to this day. More than half a millennium since it was first painted, the real identity of the Mona Lisa remains one of art’s greatest mysteries, intriguing scholars and enthusiasts alike.
The painting has traditionally been associated with Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo. But another compelling theory suggests a different sitter: Isabella of Aragon.

Isabella of Aragon was born into the illustrious House of Aragon in Naples, in 1470. She was a princess who was deeply entwined in the political and cultural fabric of the Renaissance.
Her 1490 marriage to Gian Galeazzo Sforza, Duke of Milan, positioned Isabella at the heart of Italian politics. And this role was both complicated and elevated by the ambitions and machinations of Ludovico Sforza (also called Ludovico il Moro), her husband’s uncle and usurper of the Milanese dukedom.

Scholarly perspectives
The theory that Isabella is the real Mona Lisa is supported by a combination of stylistic analyses, historical connections and reinterpretations of Leonardo’s intent as an artist.
In his biography of Leonardo, author Robert Payne points to preliminary studies by the artist that bear a striking resemblances to Isabella around age 20. Payne suggests Leonardo captured Isabella across different life stages, including during widowhood, as depicted in the Mona Lisa. 
US artist Lillian F. Schwartz’s 1988 study used x-rays to reveal an initial sketch of a woman hidden beneath Leonardo’s painting. This sketch was then painted over with Leonardo’s own likeness. 
Schwartz believes the woman in the sketch is Isabella, because of its similarity with a cartoon Leonardo made of the princess. She proposes the work was made by integrating specific features of the initial model with Leonardo’s own features. 

This hypothesis is further supported by art historians Jerzy Kulski and Maike Vogt-Luerssen. 
According to Vogt-Luerssen’s detailed analysis of the Mona Lisa, the symbols of the Sforza house and the depiction of mourning garb both align with Isabella’s known life circumstances. They suggest the Mona Lisa isn’t a commissioned portrait, but a nuanced representation of a woman’s journey through triumph and tragedy.
Similarly, Kulski highlights the portrait’s heraldic designs, which would be atypical for a silk merchant’s wife. He, too, suggests the painting shows Isabella mourning her late husband. 
The Mona Lisa’s enigmatic expression also captures Isabella’s self-described state post-1500 of being “alone in misfortune”. Contrary to representing a wealthy, recently married woman, the portrait exudes the aura of a virtuous widow.

Late professor of art history Joanna Woods-Marsden suggested the Mona Lisa transcends traditional portraiture and embodies Leonardo’s ideal, rather than being a straightforward commission. 
This perspective frames the work as a deeply personal project for Leonardo, possibly signifying a special connection between him and Isabella. Leonardo’s reluctance to part with the work also indicates a deeper, personal investment in it. 
Beyond the canvas
The theory that Isabella of Aragon could be the true Mona Lisa is a profound reevaluation of the painting’s context, opening up new avenues through which to appreciate the work.
It elevates Isabella from a figure overshadowed by the men in her life, to a woman of courage and complexity who deserves recognition in her own right.

Through her strategic marriage and political savvy, Isabella played a crucial role in the alliances and conflicts that defined the Italian Renaissance. By possibly choosing her as his subject, Leonardo immortalised her and also made a profound statement on the complexity and agency of women in a male-dominated society.
The ongoing debate over Mona Lisa’s identity underscores this work’s significance as a cultural and historical artefact. It also invites us to reflect on the roles of women in the Renaissance and challenge common narratives that minimise them.
In this light, it becomes a legacy of the women who shaped the Renaissance.

"Thieves, needlewomen, Aboriginal warriors and a ten-year-old boy: the free people transported as convicts to Van Diemenâs Land",https://theconversation.com/thieves-needlewomen-aboriginal-warriors-and-a-ten-year-old-boy-the-free-people-transported-as-convicts-to-van-diemens-land-228018,3022868,"Australian history, Incarceration, Frontier Wars, Convict history, Van Diemen's Land, Tasmanian history, The Female Factory","
Emma Cotton (or Cotterell) sailed into Sydney harbour on the Rubicon in 1833 as a free immigrant. A 32-year-old woman of independent means, she took on needlework in the colony. Emma’s genteel life unravelled four years later when she appeared before a Sydney court charged with stealing a bundle of “wearing apparel”.
Emma was transported to Van Diemen’s Land (lutruwita or Tasmania) for seven years, then spent the rest of her life in Hobart. After her sudden death in February 1863, a local newspaper reported she was “better known as old Emma the fortune teller”. If Emma had been able to foretell her own future, she may have chosen to stay in London.
Conditions for convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were tough. Food was rationed. Many prisoners spent time in penal stations such as Port Arthur, female houses of correction known as “female factories”, probation stations, where convicts were required to serve the initial period of their sentences, or asylums. A prison for boys, Point Puer, was built next to Port Arthur. Some men laboured on road gangs. 
Women often worked in colonists’ homes as domestic servants. Emma was assigned to work at the Police Magistrate’s office. She also did time, probably at the infamous wash tubs at the Cascades Female Factory in South Hobart.
Details of Emma’s case were carefully captured in a convict indent register. Now known as CON16, five of these rectangular registers with their spidery handwriting and tatty bindings survive. Among the many named in them are 627 men, women and children who arrived free or were born free in the Australian colonies but became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land.
Their stories have, until now, mostly been forgotten. They challenge popular narratives of Australian history suggesting only convicts from Britain and Ireland were transported to Van Diemen’s Land. 
The youngest prisoner, a boy called Joseph Levy, was just ten when transported for perjury. The oldest was a 75-year-old man who laboured on a road gang.

As well as Indigenous convicts from the Cape colony (now part of South Africa) and New Zealand, more than 60 Aboriginal men from mainland Australia were transported as convicts during the 19th-century frontier wars. 
In the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (now Victoria), some Aboriginal warriors engaged in economic sabotage. Yanem Goona, also known as “Old Man Billy Billy”, was thought to be a ringleader. When a large flock of sheep was driven off a station near Mt Arapiles in 1845, a white-led Native Police contingent tracked the missing animals, locating around 200 sheep in a “bush yard” built by local Aboriginal people.
Yanem Goona was arrested, tried and sentenced to ten years’ transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. When serving his initial probationary period at Norfolk Island, a visitor noted how the old man cried whenever he thought of home. 
After being shipped to Van Diemen’s Land, Yanem Goona died in custody at the Impression Bay probation station on October 31 1848.
‘A good riddance’
Of these 627 people named and detailed in the register, 276 were sentenced in NSW. Forty-five went through the South Australian law courts, 29 were shipped from Victoria, and 19 from Western Australia. Within Van Diemen’s Land itself, 247 free people were sentenced to transportation and sent to Port Arthur and other convict establishments. The overwhelming majority, more than 88%, were male.
The first entry in the register is for Thomas Carroll, an Englishman who arrived free in Launceston in November 1831. Carroll opened a livery stables, advertising horses and gigs for hire, and his services breaking in fillies and colts. After moving to Hobart and working as a groom, Carroll was found guilty of stealing a saddle and sentenced to transportation for seven years. He was sent to work on a road gang a few miles from Hobart.
Peter Haley (or Caley) was a groom in Adelaide before being sentenced to transportation for ten years for horse stealing. 
Born near Cape Town, Haley was a Khoisan man who arrived free in Sydney in 1839. By 1850 he had become a notorious horse thief. The following year he was transported to Van Diemen’s Land where he served 15 months at Cascades probation station before being sent into service at New Norfolk, a rural area located inland from Hobart. As a convict labourer, he continued to steal horses. His sentence was extended to transportation for life. 
Ultimately, Haley absconded, joined a gang of bush-rangers, and was nicknamed “Black Peter”. Eventually the gang was captured, tried and executed. Haley was hanged in Hobart in February 1859 alongside one of his friends. 
Not all formerly free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land were sentenced to transportation. Occasionally their sentence was “death recorded”, meaning they were sentenced to death with an immediate reprieve, then transported instead. 
Such was the case for Dola, a southeast Asian sailor found guilty in Adelaide of attempted murder on the high seas. When he and seven other convicts were sent to Hobart in June 1851 on the brig Union, the Adelaide Observer announced their departure under the headline “A Good Riddance”.

83 ‘stripes on the breech’
The median age of these convicts was 42.5 years – much higher than today’s median age of 31 years for offenders. Only 10% were under the age of 20. However, there were some outliers. 
Joseph Levy appeared before the Berrima Circuit Court in NSW in September 1841, aged ten. One of six children from a Catholic family living at Blacktown, Joseph was a key witness in a case involving an alleged horse-stabbing. Levy told the court the horse’s owner had promised him a cow and a calf if the boy said he had witnessed the attack. However, he hadn’t seen anything. 
Levy was charged with perjury then transported to Van Diemen’s Land for seven years. While incarcerated at Point Puer, a facility for boys, Levy was punished many times. He received a total of 83 “stripes on the breech” and spent 61 days in solitary confinement. When his sentence expired in 1848, Levy was sent back to NSW.
Michael Caffray, meanwhile, was a carpenter from Dublin who came out to Van Diemen’s Land as a free migrant. He was 75 when tried in Hobart in 1836 for receiving 40 pounds of stolen mutton and sentenced to transportation for 14 years.
Caffray laboured on the Grass Tree Hill road gang on the outskirts of Hobart while under sentence. He died in 1854 from paralysis at Impression Bay on the Tasman Peninsula.
Violent interpersonal crimes (murder, manslaughter, rape and assault) account for only 8% of cases resulting in transportation to Van Diemen’s Land. Some crimes, such as larceny, burglary, housebreaking, robbery and stealing from a person (49.5% of cases), are not unexpected. Stealing animals (cattle, horses and sheep) also figure frequently (12.3% of cases). 
However, offences we view as white collar crimes, which don’t attract lengthy prison sentences today, figure quite often. These include forgery, embezzlement, and fraud and false pretences.
Various bigamists, arsonists, military absconders and offenders, perjurers and those convicted of “unnatural offences” also lost their freedom. Convicts who offended while serving their sentences received further punishments.
All the free people who became convicts in Van Diemen’s Land had something in common. The activities they engaged in were criminalised, and they were seen as bad characters. Those who survived the system were viewed as “tainted” within their own lifetimes. 
But the criminal deportation of these formerly free people tells us more about  colonial Australian attitudes and values than it does about the individuals themselves.

"Sexual identity is an important part of our lives, and the law should recognize that",https://theconversation.com/sexual-identity-is-an-important-part-of-our-lives-and-the-law-should-recognize-that-230109,3022812,"Sex, Sexuality, asexuality, Polyamory, Sexual identity, pride month, Asexual, LGBTQQ2S+, Ethical non-monogamy","
An Alberta court recently ruled in the case of a Calgary man, Matthew Mills, who ran a private club out of his home for people who identify as non-monogamous. Mills was charged for a zoning violation — he was accused of operating an unsanctioned “social organization” in a residential area. 
Mills claimed that the charges against him infringed on his right to define his identity in his own way. This is because, as he told the court, he is “involved in ethical non-monogamy as a core aspect of his lifestyle” and that he “considers his views and preferences in this regard to be part of his sexual orientation.” 
The court decided that Mills could continue hosting the event, but could not continue to brand it as a club. The judge said “personal sexual expression, in all its many-splendored forms, is a fundamental aspect of human life, experience and fulfillment. Legislative or other state restrictions targeting legal, consensual, private sexual activity will attract close Charter scrutiny.” 
The court did not go as far as Mills wanted it to. It declined to recognize polyamory as a protected category under the Charter. However, in the near future, the courts may not be so hesitant. Nor should they be. As this case shows, sexual identity is central to people’s conceptions of themselves. It is just as important as traditional sources of identity such as religion — and it deserves the same level of protection.





How sex became an identity
Sexual identity is not only a matter of our sexual orientation or gender identity — as important as these still are. People increasingly also define themselves with reference to things like kinks, non-monogamy and asexuality, as well as less familiar categories such as ecosexual and digisexual. 
This idea that a person’s sexuality can be an integral part of their identity, of their sense of “who I am as a person” is still quite new. 
Before the 19th century, people did not think sexual behaviour reflected some essential feature of an individual. Sex was just something you did. This is not to say sex acts were morally neutral, or that they were left unregulated. Both church and state kept a close eye on people’s private behaviour. However, even if you transgressed the society’s many restrictions, your sexual behaviour did not determine your identity. 

This changed in the late 19th century, when psychologists began to categorize people according to the gender of the person they were attracted to. This was not at first a great advance, since same-sex desire was considered by many of these early psychologists to be a pathology. But as the result of a long struggle by gay and lesbian activists, being gay became something to be proud of, and it is now an identity protected by law. 
In the last few decades, other sexual identities have become more visible, and the people who define themselves with reference to them have started to demand similar recognition.
We should embrace these new, various sources of sexual self-definition. It is one of the great virtues of living in an accepting, tolerant society, that we can define ourselves and our sense of self on our own terms, without the state passing judgment on how we chose to do it.

      How a digital archive is preserving Canada's history of LGBTQ+ activism




The backlash
There are those who disagree. They view the demands for recognition by sexual minorities as dangerous. After former New York governor Andrew Cuomo’s daughter, Michaela Cuomo, came out as demisexual (demisexuals prefer to have sex within the context of an intimate relationship), the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro railed against what he called “neo-identities.” He said: “The country does not have a future with this kind of stuff, it just does not.”
Shapiro worries that young people have been told that there are “only victims and victimizers in American society” and that they are therefore seeking out, or even creating, minority identities for themselves specifically in order to join the “coalition of the oppressed.” Trendy new sexual identities give them, he thinks, something to latch on to for this purpose.
But people like Mills are not making extravagant demands in order to promote their own victimhood. They are asking for the social recognition, along with the basic legal protections, we already offer a wide range of other groups. 
Mills compared his legal claim to what would be offered to members of a minority religion. In explaining his ruling, the judge wrote: 

The Applicant argues that his belief in ethical non-monogamy is a sincerely held, profoundly personal belief, governing his perception of himself and how he should live. As such, he claims that these beliefs attract the protection of s 2(a) of the Charter, which enshrines “freedom of conscience and religion” as a fundamental freedom.

Indeed, the legal system affords recognition and protection to a very wide diversity of religious groups, including ones some people would dismiss as weird or marginal. So, why can’t our sexual identities also benefit from the same protection?

The value of diversity
Some in the LGBTQ+ community have resisted the idea that identities such as being polyamorous deserve recognition on par with sexual orientation. One worry is that, if people claiming a wide array of sexual identities all start seeking recognition, it will take the focus away from the on-going struggle for full equality for gays, lesbians and trans people, who have been long-standing targets of discrimination.
This concern, though understandable, is unfounded. Social toleration is not a finite resource, and neither are legal rights. A society that values racial diversity, for instance, does not, and need not, pick and choose which racial groups to accept.
On the contrary, the way to fight hatred against one group is to create a world where everyone is accepted. Toleration is not a stock of capital we spend down till it is gone. It is an investment that returns us dividends, and these dividends grow more generous the more we spend on it.
Protecting sexual identity in the same way we protect other identities, like religious beliefs, would lead to modest but important changes to our laws. People could no longer be fired from their job because they are kinky or non-monogamous, for instance. Their sexual choices could not be used against them in custody disputes. We might have to expand our definition of marriage further, to include multiple partnerships. Above all, we would send a powerful message as a society, by affirming the importance of sexuality in its wondrous diversity.

"Work-related health and safety issues must be paid for by employers, not the public",https://theconversation.com/work-related-health-and-safety-issues-must-be-paid-for-by-employers-not-the-public-229162,3022811,"Work, Jobs, Workplace, Health and safety, Amazon, Workplace safety, Workers, Work health and safety, worker health and safety","
Workplace health should be a priority for everyone. For employees, maintaining health and well-being at work is essential because we spend so much of our lives working. For employers, worker health is an important determinant of productivity. 
According to the Canadian Human Resources Professionals Association, the cost to Canadian businesses caused by absenteeism (absence from work due to sickness) and presenteeism (attending work despite being ill) is about $16.6 billion annually. 
Workplace health initiatives can play an important role in promoting healthy employee lifestyles. These initiatives can reduce absenteeism and health-care costs by more than 25 per cent. If an organization benefits from having a healthy workforce, then investing in the health of workers makes economic sense.
However, not all organizations follow this approach. Some large corporations have been criticized for their health practices with Amazon having been accused of replacing burned-out employees with new ones to ensure a continuous supply of healthy employees.





Amazon’s unhealthy record
Over the years, media outlets and organizations dedicated to workers’ rights have documented the high injury rates of employees at Amazon facilities that have been nearly double that of similar workplaces. 
A 2019 report by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health revealed that 13 people died while working for Amazon in the United States between 2013 and 2019.

In the past, Amazon has appeared unconcerned about labour attrition and the extremely high labour turnover of 150 per cent — nearly double the average of the retail and logistics industries.
One reason for the high turnover is the desire to avoid creating an “entrenched workforce” — people who have been working at a workplace for a significant amount of time Low skilled jobs were to be short-term in order to maintain productivity levels and avoid increasing wages. 
Increasing worker well-being
Even Amazon has come to understand the value of a healthy workforce, with former CEO Jeff Bezos acknowledging the need for Amazon to offer employees a better value proposition and to become the “Earth’s best employer.” 
In 2021, Amazon launched its WorkingWell initiative “dedicated to global workplace health and safety” and designed to halve the number of accidents at its warehouses.
These efforts have not been without their flaws. Its most famous attempt at increasing worker well-being was the introduction of its AmaZen booths. These “coffin-sized” compartments were touted as spaces where employees could watch short videos “featuring easy-to-follow well-being activities, including guided meditations, positive affirmations, calming scenes with sounds.” 

However, the initiative was met with cynicism in light of reports of Amazon employees having to urinate in plastic bottles due to being unable to take regular bathroom breaks. The video promoting the idea was taken down fairly quickly.
In March 2023, Amazon announced that its accident rates had decreased and were lower than the industry average for employers of the same size. Earlier this year the organization stated that it was investing US$750 million in worker safety.
The cost of health care
The broader societal implications of neglecting workplace health cannot be overlooked. Work is a key determinant of both our physical health and our mental health. 
While many of us are not subject to extreme working conditions, there is good reason for us all to be concerned: the negative impact of work on the health of others incurs a cost both to the individual and society.
In Canada, 70 per cent of health-care costs are funded by public tax revenues from things like personal taxes, corporate taxes and payroll levies. In 2019, the tax burden of public health care was $172 billion — a figure that likely has risen dramatically as a consequence of the pandemic.

      Why having a conversation about mental health in the workplace might not be so simple




Of course, it’s not possible to assess how much of this cost can be attributable to the impact of work on physical and mental health. Moreover, while individual taxpayers contribute to public health-care spending, organizations such as Amazon do as well. 
Amazon disclosed its Canadian tax contribution of $431 million for the first time in 2023. However, questions have been raised about the way the organization has tried to “shield its profits” from Canadian tax liabilities through “a complex web of subsidiaries” in order to limit taxable profits. 
Investing in employee health matters. If organizations fail to do so and opt instead to value productivity over the health of workers, the economic cost is borne by the taxpayer. In addition, the company sidesteps what many would see as a key responsibility towards its employees: making sure work is not unhealthy or unsafe.

Mayibuye! The 100-year-old slogan thatâs stirred up divisions in South Africaâs elections,https://theconversation.com/mayibuye-the-100-year-old-slogan-thats-stirred-up-divisions-in-south-africas-elections-230985,3022713,"Apartheid, Jacob Zuma, Political ads, post-apartheid, South African history, Cyril Ramaphosa, Peace and Security, Liberation struggle, Umkhonto weSizwe, South African poetry, African National Congress (ANC), Colonial Africa, South Africa election 2024, MK Party","
Political parties the world over use slogans, icons, colours, names and flags to establish their political and historical credentials. What happens when two political parties lay claim to the same history and the same symbolic capital? 
In South Africa, a conflict of this kind is being played out between the governing African National Congress (ANC) party led by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the breakaway party Umkhonto weSizwe, (MK Party) associated with former president Jacob Zuma. 
At the centre of the fight between the rival parties is the word “mayibuye”, which has been deployed as an election slogan for the MK Party. Mayibuye is a word in South Africa’s isiXhosa language which can be translated as “may it return” or “may it be restored”. Made popular by the ANC and the Communist Party of South Africa over 100 years ago, it is still widely used in songs and as a slogan for liberation.

The fight against apartheid was waged by many movements and individuals – Ramaphosa and Zuma among them – but victory was claimed by the ANC and its military wing Umkhonto weSizwe (Spear of the Nation). Zuma, then an ANC leader, was the country’s fourth president after democracy in 1994. But he was recalled from office by the ANC’s top decision-making body, the  National Executive Committee (NEC). In 2023 Zuma formed the MK Party to challenge the ANC in the 2024 elections.





Both parties, in short, lay claim to the same liberation history and the same weighty symbols: they both use the colours of national liberation (black, green and gold), the name Umkhonto weSizwe and the slogan “Mayibuye!”.
The new prominence of the slogan in the public domain prompts questions about when it first emerged, how it has been used and who has claimed it in the past. As a researcher working at the intersections of South African newspaper history, memory studies and popular intellectual history, I turn to the newspaper archive to trace the story of the slogan – and the political and emotional work it has been called upon to do. 
My research on “Mayibuye!” will inform a chapter in the forthcoming academic book Memory and the Language of Contention (Brill). This forms part of a larger study of activist political slogans and their ability to conjure memory. 
I argue that by drawing on the symbolic and historical resources of the “Mayibuye!” slogan, the MK Party casts doubt on the struggle credentials of the ANC and its rhetoric of a “better life” – and positions itself as the true origin and inheritor of the South African liberation movement. To understand how, one must go back in history.
The history of Mayibuye!
When linked to the idea of Africa, the liberation slogan “Mayibuye iAfrika!” (May Africa return! or Come back Africa!) is a potent call for social justice and restoration. 
According to Edward Roux, author of the first history of Black resistance struggles in South Africa, the phrase was first popularised in the early 1920s in the multilingual ANC-aligned newspaper Abantu-Batho, launched in 1912, the same year as the founding of the ANC.

This association is confirmed in the very few copies of the newspaper still in existence. Appearing in bold capitals in an advertisement for the newspaper itself, the slogan MAYIBUYE!! is used to reinforce its role in the struggle for Black rights. In this context, “Mayibuye!” is best understood not as a call to return to a pre-colonial idyll, but rather as a claim for the return of Africa to the dispossessed. A powerful reminder of the history of colonial conquest.
“Mayibuye” makes a striking reappearance in the mid-1920s in several poems by the formidable isiXhosa poet Nontsisi Mqgwetho. These appeared in the Chamber of Mines-sponsored newspaper Umteteli wa Bantu. Her poem Mayibuye iAfrika! Awu! draws on the accepted meaning of the phrase as a prophecy of restoration. But it suggests, in her characteristically outspoken style, that the problem also lies with those who “sit on the fence, won’t take a stand”; “who betray your own people to bolster the whites”.
Around the same time, “Mayibuye!” was adopted as the slogan of the League of African Rights, an unofficial organisation of the Communist Party of South Africa established in 1929 as a way to widen its support base. According to Roux, the party’s song Mayibuye was sung to the tune of the popular US traditional song Oh my Darling, Clementine.
In January 1930 the slogan appears again, this time as part of the masthead of the multilingual Communist Party of South Africa newspaper Umsebenzi, where it is spliced with the workers’ symbol of the hammer and sickle. This coincides with the shift in official party policy to the struggle for Black rights as the first stage towards socialism.

The slogan was quickly established as the “battle-cry of the publication” and appeared frequently in many of Umsebenzi’s political cartoons. Versions of the Mayibuye song, in the isiXhosa, Sesotho and Afrikaans languages, were printed in the newspaper and sung at political rallies. 
Frequently invoked in the context of local Black struggles, the slogan is strongly associated with the history of colonial plunder and, especially, the theft of land.
Prophecy and lament
The slogan’s appearance across several newspapers and political contexts is testament to its multifaceted meanings and complex legacy. Its history reveals its significance as both a prophecy of heroic overcoming and a sorrowful lament, one which imagines a future emancipation through the idea of return. 
In later years, “Mayibuye!” would become entrenched as a popular rallying cry of the ANC, accompanied, from the 1940s onwards, with the ANC salute (raised right fist with thumb pointing to the right shoulder). In these contexts, it combined an unambiguous statement of militancy and defiance with the search for self-determination.

In 2024, the MK Party’s use of this slogan draws a direct line to the land-centred, anticolonial and freedom-oriented rhetoric of its early ANC and Communist Party of South Africa versions. As the website logo affirms, it is “Time to rise up | Isikhathi sokuvuka | Ke nako ya go tsoga”. 
The reappearance of “Mayibuye!” in the present – and its strong associations with the party’s mission of “reclaiming our birthright” – suggests not only that the anticolonial struggle has not been completed but also that the struggle for freedom has barely begun.

Portia from the comedy-drama series The White Lotus is the epitome of Generation Z. As the assistant for a self-absorbed heiress, she embodies both the strengths and flaws of the younger generation: perpetually connected to the digital world, brimming with intelligence and full of untapped potential.
While Portia’s sometimes obnoxious behaviour can be grating, they also render her relatable. In one scene, she ruminates on a time when the world had more to offer:

“You take a picture and then you realize that everybody’s taken that exact same picture from that exact same spot, and you’ve just made some redundant content for stupid Instagram. And you can’t even get lost anymore because you can just find yourself on Google maps.”

It’s a sentiment that captures Gen Z’s struggle with, and desire for, authenticity. Portia’s journey reflects the broader Gen Z experience. Initially adrift, she eventually receives a wake-up call that drives her to take control of her life. 
If you, like Portia, are also struggling to meet your boss’ expectations about work, it may help to understand how older generations have shaped management, and how you can thrive in the modern workplace.

If using LinkedIn makes you feel like an imposter at work, here’s how to cope
What millennials and gen Z professionals need to know about developing a meaningful career


History’s greatest hustle devotees
Millennials are arguably history’s greatest devotees of hustle culture. Those born between 1981 and 1996 are more likely to work multiple jobs, with many of them working two or more. One in three millennials intends to work for an app-based company like Uber or Lyft, or rent out their home to earn extra income.
Millennials grew up alongside the internet on the heels of the 2008 recession. Faced with a precarious job market and financial instability, many turned their passions into side hustles.
These side hustles range from online courses and coaching to podcasts and social media influencing. For Millennials, these endeavours are seen as a source of happiness, employability and skill development.

Side hustles require them to be efficient, more disciplined and concerned with prioritization and focus. Free time often means switching from the main job to the side hustle, and open weekends are a rarity.
However, for Gen Z and some younger Millennials, the prospect of joining the hustle culture may seem daunting and exhausting. Instead, they want to be financially stable and successful without sacrificing their mental health and well-being.
Generational differences at work
Every generation leaves their mark on the workplace. Millennials in particular, through their ability to process information in a much more streamlined and efficient fashion than any previous generation. 
Millennials increased workplace productivity and remodelled leadership trends. They changed the traditional workplace by wanting to matter, by wanting constant dialogue, and by wanting more opportunity and freedom.
The younger generation is just as ambitious, but they, too, are leaving their mark on work culture. 48 per cent of Gen Z small business owners juggle multiple side jobs, while 91 per cent work unconventional hours and 81 per cent work while on vacation. Almost half hold two jobs or more.
But not every young professional is a small business owner or interested in hustle culture — some just want more freedom and a greater sense of self meaning. 
Many people in their 20s and 30s are shaking off the typical 9-to-5 career path. For these individuals, success is not only measured in dollars, but also in overall happiness and fulfilment.

Work-life balance
As a young person in the workplace, you might find yourself clashing with your older boss. Somewhat hypocritically, older bosses often view candidates with multiple jobs as lacking commitment, despite having done the same thing themselves.
Bridging the generational gap in the workplace requires open communication and mutual understanding. As a young professional, navigating hustle culture in the workplace can be challenging, but not impossible. Here are some tips for success:

Be conscious of your mental well-being. An older boss might relentlessly pressure you for results and greater productivity, often at your cost and their gain. If you do not pay attention, you will soon find yourself stressed, burned out and likely feeling inadequate.
Define your own priorities. Set clear boundaries between your work and personal life and prioritize tasks based on significance and impact, establish work hours and dedicate time for yourself, family and leisure. Don’t alienate your boss by directly refusing work, but do thoughtfully explain and gradually implement your boundaries.
Be objectively productive. Remember that time spent working doesn’t always equate to productivity. Over-working on the side will negatively impact your workplace performance. You need to measure and evaluate yourself constantly to prove your commitment, be able to innovate and be productive at your main job.
Recognize that not every workplace will be ideal for you. Instead of worrying about climbing the career ladder, seek out a workplace that acknowledges and nurtures the well-being of their employees. This might involve a job with a certain amount of flexibility or remote work, and a culture of collaboration, teamwork and diversity. An enforced top-down hierarchy may not be the best work environment for everyone. If your current workplace doesn’t align with your values and needs, consider exploring other opportunities or even starting your own venture.

DNA analysis reveals that there are more species of parasitoid wasps than anticipated,https://theconversation.com/dna-analysis-reveals-that-there-are-more-species-of-parasitoid-wasps-than-anticipated-213828,3022350,"DNA, Insects, Wasps, Charles Darwin, Alien","
When Charles Darwin first encountered parasitoid wasps, he was horrified. In an 1860 letter to American botanist Asa Gray, he wrote: “I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars.” 
The wasps that Darwin encountered were ichneumon wasps, now also known as Darwin wasps, and it is believed that they greatly influenced the way Darwin thought about nature.
A century later, in 1979, the sci-fi horror film Alien was released, featuring a xenomorph, an extraterrestrial creature that parasitizes humans. According to Dan O'Bannon, who wrote the story the film was based on and co-wrote the screenplay, parasitoid wasps and their life cycle were the inspiration behind the alien.

In 2018, scientists from Australia returned the love, and named a new species of parasitoid wasps Dolichogenidea xenomorph, after the alien.





Predators and parasites
To most people, parasitoid wasps are invisible. Their life cycles are quite remarkable, yet they remain almost unknown outside the world of hymenopterists, entomologists who study wasps, as well as ants, bees and other members of the Hymenoptera order.
Parasitoid wasps require a host to finish their development. They are a cross between parasites and predators: like parasites, they feed on their host, and like predators, they ultimately kill it. 
Different groups of parasitoid wasps attack different groups of hosts. Wasps in the subfamily Aphidiinae feed exclusively on aphids. Aphids can decrease crop yields and spread plant viruses, necessitating the use of harmful pesticides. Since the host meets its demise after an encounter with a parasitoid, these wasps are used for biological control, and help naturally control aphid populations.

Classification
Biological control only works if we know what we’re controlling and what we’re controlling it with. Taxonomists, like my colleagues and myself, examine insects (in my case, aphids and their parasitoids) and classify them into species. 
Taxonomy of living things relies mostly on their morphology. We still use this method heavily, dissecting these tiny insects and looking at them under a microscope to find differences or similarities and figure out which species we’re looking at. When you’re working with one to two millimetre long creatures, this can be daunting.

      The invasive emerald ash borer has destroyed millions of trees – scientists aim to control it with tiny parasitic wasps




Technologies like DNA barcoding, devised by biologist Paul Hebert, and DNA sequencing methods, especially next generation sequencing have accelerated this work. Now, I can get a wasp’s DNA and figure out which species it belongs to without having to visually examine the specimen. 
To do that, we need a comprehensive reference library of DNA sequences, which is a huge and ongoing task. In online databases containing reference sequences some groups are better represented than others. Ideally, I would use both morphological and molecular data in my work and avoid any misidentifications. 
Wasp diversity
Parasitoid wasps seem to be more diverse than assumed. Beetles have long been the “official” insect order, with the highest number of species. However, Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, sawflies, and ants) are actually more species-rich, with huge numbers of cryptic and still unknown species. 
Ants often help protect aphids from predators and parasitoids, and collect honeydew from them in return. Ladybugs are voracious predators of aphids, and can also be used in biological control. They are also the bane of hymenopterists, because they will eat aphids, parasitoid larva and all.

A parasitized aphid is called a mummy, and it’s basically a parasitoid wasp larva or pupa developing in a dead aphid skin. In the next stage, the adult wasp will emerge and go about its business of eating, mating, and if it’s a female wasp, finding new hosts to lay her eggs and start the cycle all over again. 
Cryptic species
Cryptic species look very similar or identical to other species, but when their DNA is sequenced, there are clear differences in certain genes that indicate there are three or five species instead of one. Identifying species correctly is necessary for proper conservation efforts. 
Additionally, correct identification of species is essential for applied fields, like biological control. Closely related and morphologically indistinguishable species of biocontrol agents can have different host requirements, and as a consequence, won’t be effective in controlling the same pests. 
It seems that the importance of biodiversity is finally becoming clear to a wider audience beyond scientists, which is great news. Since much of our planet’s biodiversity still remains hidden, we need to describe as many species as we can, as soon as we can, to be able to protect them in time.

There’s a new electoral law in place. What does this mean for the ballot paper and voters’ choices?
The new electoral system means that voters will receive three ballot papers instead of the two they got in the past: two national ballots (the regional and compensatory ballots) and one provincial ballot paper.
The first national ballot has a list of political parties that are contesting 200 National Assembly seats across the country. The second is the regional ballot in each province: it is for political parties and independent candidates in the nine provinces contesting the other 200 seats in the National Assembly. In total there are 400 seats in the National Assembly. The third is the provincial ballot for the provincial legislatures. South Africa has nine provinces. 
Voters will therefore have to make three choices: two for the National Assembly and one for their provincial legislature. It creates the possibility of “strategic” voting. Voters can choose between different parties (or a party and an independent candidate) at the national level. It will also be possible to vote for one party at the national level and for another party (or an independent) at the provincial level. 





The amended electoral system also allows independent candidates to stand at both the national and provincial levels for the first time.
The new system is therefore a combination of party lists and individual candidates. The new lists for the provincial legislatures look the same as the national “regional” lists. 
What about the choices on the ballot paper?
The options on the national ballot paper increased from 48 parties in 2019 to 52 in 2024. In 1994, 19 parties participated in the first national election. The number of parties has increased gradually over 30 years, not suddenly since the most recent elections. 
During the 30 years, the number of parties with seats in the National Assembly has remained relatively constant at about 14. In 1994, three – namely the African National Congress (ANC), New National Party (NNP) and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) – each received more than 10% support at the national level. In 1999, this changed with the NNP’s dramatic loss of support and the emergence of the Democratic Alliance (DA). The NNP party was dissolved in 2005.
The Inkatha Freedom Party also declined between 2009 and 2016, but started to recover thereafter. The Congress of the People (Cope) (2009)  and the Economic Freedom Fighters  (EFF) (2014) emerged as newcomers. Cope has largely disappeared while the DA and EFF have increased their support to between 10% and 20%. 
The ANC, DA, EFF and IFP are therefore the main options in 2024, followed by a host of small parties with 1%-2% support. The latest addition is the uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) led by former president Jacob Zuma. Its support is still untested but it appears to have much potential in the KwaZulu-Natal province. Opinion polls suggest a national presence for the party of about 8%. In principle it means that the main contest is between about five to eight parties. This establishes a truly multiparty dispensation. It also enables a number of options for coalition governments.
The ruling party risks losing 50%. What does this mean?
The 2024 election might become a milestone because, for the first time since 1994, a national coalition government is a possibility. It will differ from the Government of National Unity of 1994-1999 (consisting of the ANC, NNP and IFP), which was an oversized, grand coalition agreed upon before the election as part of the negotiated transition package. It was thus not a conventional coalition government. 
The possibility that the ruling ANC might receive less than 50%+1 of the votes at the national level or in some of the provincial legislatures will be highly significant. That’s because  the ANC has been a dominant party for 30 years.
This is not unique and dominant parties were in the past or still are in power in India, Sweden, Japan, Botswana, Mexico, Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. This started to change in South Africa at local government level in 2016. The ANC’s dominance of South African politics has been premised on the fact that before 1990 it developed the status (together with the Pan Africanist Congress of Azania) of an internationally endorsed liberation movement of South Africa.
The ANC also enjoyed elevated status as the party of Nelson Mandela, its late world-renowned leader. It enjoyed international recognition even before it was elected as the government of South Africa. It occupied a moral high ground which no other party could challenge. That moral status and popular support are now under pressure. The risk for the ANC is that, if it loses its status as the sole governing party, its decline may accelerate without the possibility of recovery.

Hate speech and disinformation in South Africaâs elections: big tech make it tough to monitor social media,https://theconversation.com/hate-speech-and-disinformation-in-south-africas-elections-big-tech-make-it-tough-to-monitor-social-media-230945,3021668,"Social media, Africa, Big data, South Africa, Hate speech, Peace and Security, Disinformation, Big tech, Online attacks, Meta, South Africa election 2024","
There’s a growing global movement to ensure that researchers can get access to the huge quantity of data assembled and exploited by digital operators. 
Momentum is mounting because it’s becoming increasingly evident that data is power. And access to it is the key – for a host of reasons, not least transparency, human rights and electoral integrity. 
But there’s currently a massive international asymmetry in access to data. 
In the European Union and the US, some progress has been made. For example, EU researchers studying risks have a legal right of access. In the US too, some companies have taken voluntary steps to improve access.





The situation is generally very different in the global south. 
The value of data access can be seen vividly in the monitoring of social media during elections. South Africa is a case in point. A powerful “big data” analysis was recently published about online attacks on women journalists there, raising the alarm about escalation around – and after – the election on 29 May. 
A number of groups working with data are attempting to monitor hate speech and disinformation on social media ahead of South Africa’s national and provincial polls. At a recent workshop involving 10 of these initiatives, participants described trying to detect co-ordinated “information operations” that could harm the election, including via foreign interference. 
But these researchers can’t get all the data they need because the tech companies don’t give them access. 
This has been a concern of mine since I first commissioned a handbook about harmful online content – Journalism, Fake News & Disinformation: Handbook for Journalism Education and Training – six years ago. My experience since then includes overseeing a major UN study called Balancing Act: Countering Digital Disinformation While Respecting Freedom of Expression.   
Over the years, I’ve learnt that to dig into online disinformation, you need to get right inside the social media engines. Without comprehensive access to the data they hold, you’re left in relative darkness about the  workings of manipulators, the role of misled punters and the fuel provided by mysterious corporate algorithms. 
Monitoring
Looking at social media in the South African elections, the researchers at the recent workshop shared how they were doing their best with what limited data they had. They were all monitoring text on social platforms. Some were monitoring audio, while a few were looking at “synthetic content” such as material produced with generative AI.  
About half of 10 initiatives were tracking followers, impressions and engagement. Nearly all were checking content on Twitter; at least four were monitoring Facebook;  three covered YouTube; and two included TikTok. 
WhatsApp was getting scant attention. Though most messaging on the service is encrypted, the company knows (but doesn’t disclose) which registered user is bulk sending content to which others, who forwards this on, whether group admins are active or not, and a host of other “metadata” details that could help monitors to track dangerous trajectories.  
But the researchers can’t do the necessary deep data dives. They’ve set out the difficult data conditions they work under in a public statement explaining how they are severely constrained in their access to data.
One data source they use is expensive (and limited) packages from marketing brokers (who in turn have purchased data assets wholesale from the platforms). 
A second source is from analysing published posts online (which excludes in-group and WhatsApp communications).  Using scraped data is limited and labour-intensive. Findings are superficial. And it’s risky: scraping is forbidden in most platforms’ terms of use. 
None of the researchers covering South Africa’s elections have direct access to the platforms’ own Application Programme Interfaces (APIs). These gateways provide a direct pipeline into the computer servers hosting data. This major resource is what companies use to profile users, amplify content, target ads and automate content moderation. It’s an essential input for monitoring online electoral harms.   
In the EU, the Digital Services Act enables vetted researchers to legally demand and receive free, and potentially wide-ranging, API access to search for “systemic risks” on the platforms. 
It’s also more open in the US. There, Meta, the multinational technology giant that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, cherrypicked 16 researchers in the 2020 elections (of which only five projects have published their findings). The company has subsequently outsourced the judging of Facebook and Instagram access requests (from anywhere worldwide) to the University of Michigan. 
One of the South African researchers tried that channel, without success. 
Other platforms such as TikTok are still making unilateral decisions, even in the US, as to who has data access. 
Outside the EU and the US, it’s hard even to get a dialogue going with the platforms.
The fightback
Last November, I invited the bigger tech players to join a workshop in Cape Town on data access and elections in Africa. There was effectively no response.  
The same pattern is evident in an initiative earlier this year by the South African National Editors’ Forum. The forum suggested a dialogue around a human rights impact assessment of online risks to the South African elections. They were ignored.
Against this background, two South African NGOs – the Legal Resources Centre and the Campaign for Free Expression – are using South Africa’s expansive Promotion of Access to Information Act to compel platforms to disclose their election plans.  
But the  companies have refused to respond, claiming that they do not fall under South African jurisdiction. This has led to appeals being launched to the country’s Information Regulator to compel disclosures. 
Further momentum for change may also come from Unesco, which is promoting international Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms. These highlight transparency and the issue of research access. Unesco has also published a report that I researched titled Data Sharing to Foster Information as a Public Good. 
In the works is an incipient African Alliance for Access to Data, now involving five pan-African formations. This coalition (I’m interim convenor) is engaging the African Union on the issues. 
But there’s no guarantee yet that all this will lead the platforms to open up data to Africans and researchers in the global south.

Your smartphone might be linked to crocodile attacks in Indonesia. Hereâs how,https://theconversation.com/your-smartphone-might-be-linked-to-crocodile-attacks-in-indonesia-heres-how-229630,3020919,"Indonesia, Smartphones, Crocodiles, Environment, Human animal conflict, crocodile attack","
What’s the connection between your smartphone and crocodile attacks? It’s quite straightforward. 
Smartphones need tin, which is often mined illegally in Indonesia. When illegal tin mines are abandoned, they fill with water. Crocodiles enter from nearby waterways, looking for food, as fishing and other human pressures have made prey short. Croc attacks increase. 
That’s the short version. Here’s the longer one. 
After intense culling in Indonesia in the 20th century, saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) are now returning to islands such as Bali and Java. Croc attacks have become a serious issue. Over 1,000 attacks have taken place in the ten years to 2023, leading to 486 deaths.
But these attacks aren’t distributed evenly. Croc hotspots include the Bangka-Belitung islands, off the southeastern coast of Sumatra. And these islands have a huge amount of tin. 

The islands of tin
The Bangka-Belitung province consists of two large namesake islands, as well as hundreds of smaller islands. About 1.5 million people live here. Tin is the mainstay of the economy. 
Tin is vital to smartphone production, as it is used to solder different components together. Indonesia is second only to China in tin production, producing roughly a third of the world supply. And within Indonesia, almost all the tin – 90% – comes from the Bangka-Belitung islands. 
During the authoritarian Suharto government, tin mining here was controlled by the central government. After Indonesia democratised in 1998, the regional government of Bangka-Belitung gained control of tin. In 2001, the government allowed its citizens the right to mine tin. Illegal tin mines ballooned as a result, increasing four-fold in just three years after the laws passed. 

Two decades later, illegal tin-mining has now destroyed much of the province’s biodiversity, particularly fish populations. It’s dangerous work for humans – around 150 miners die each year due to accidents, including crocodile attacks. Miners have also encroached into crocodile habitat such as mangroves.  
Tin mining makes the landscape look like the moon. Native animals flee or die. Mud pollutes waterways. Fish numbers dwindle. And crocodiles get hungrier. They start looking for different prey. Dogs. Cows. Humans. 
Desperate humans, desperate crocodiles
Illegal tin mining brings crocodiles closer to humans by creating new habitat, though of poor quality. After miners dig out the tin ore by hand, the craters left behind fill with water, creating pools known as “kulongs”. 
These kulongs are often found close enough to waterways that fish and other prey animals can end up living in them after a flood. These mining pools go much further inland than natural waterways on the islands do, allowing salties to reach far further inland. Hungry crocodiles come for the fish, but might go after a dog or human. 

It’s not only mining – the felling of forests and planting of oil palms often comes with the creation of drainage canals. These canals make it easier for crocs to get close to areas where workers might be swimming or fishing. 
All of this means the sharp increase in croc attacks was almost inevitable. Destroying habitat while mining in or near waterways means crocodiles found it easier and easier to be near humans. 
Over the 10 years to 2023, almost 100 crocodile attacks were reported on these islands, and 41 people died. Of these attacks, almost a third (32%) were in current or former tin mines, and one sixth (16.5%) were mining at the time. 
By contrast, over that same decade in Queensland, there were just five fatal attacks and 14 non-fatal. 
As Langka Sani, the founder of local wildlife conservation group Alobi Foundation has said: 

In the past, we might never hear of a crocodile attack in a year, whereas now in the last two weeks there have been dozens of reports of crocodile cases.

His organisation has taken in dozens of crocodiles attacked by people as reprisals for croc attacks. Some of these are being resettled.  
Reducing croc attacks will mean ending illegal tin-mining. Is that possible? Yes, but it’s unlikely. The state-owned tin mining company, PT Timah, provides miners with safer working conditions. But they cannot compete with the extra income from illegal mining. 
That means for the foreseeable future, the world’s demand for tin for smartphones will have a deadly cost.

"Eat a rock a day, put glue on your pizza: how Googleâs AI is losing touch with reality",https://theconversation.com/eat-a-rock-a-day-put-glue-on-your-pizza-how-googles-ai-is-losing-touch-with-reality-230953,3020840,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Google, Search engines, Misinformation, Large language models","
Google has rolled out its latest experimental search feature on Chrome, Firefox and the Google app browser to hundreds of millions of users. “AI Overviews” saves you clicking on links by using generative AI — the same technology that powers rival product ChatGPT — to provide summaries of the search results. Ask “how to keep bananas fresh for longer” and it uses AI to generate a useful summary of tips such as storing them in a cool, dark place and away from other fruits like apples.
But ask it a left-field question and the results can be disastrous, or even dangerous. Google is currently scrambling to fix these problems one by one, but it is a PR disaster for the search giant and a challenging game of whack-a-mole.

AI Overviews helpfully tells you that “Whack-A-Mole is a classic arcade game where players use a mallet to hit moles that pop up at random for points. The game was invented in Japan in 1975 by the amusement manufacturer TOGO and was originally called Mogura Taiji or Mogura Tataki.”
But AI Overviews also tells you that “astronauts have met cats on the moon, played with them, and provided care”. More worryingly, it also recommends “you should eat at least one small rock per day” as “rocks are a vital source of minerals and vitamins”, and suggests putting glue in pizza topping.





Why is this happening?
One fundamental problem is that generative AI tools don’t know what is true, just what is popular. For example, there aren’t a lot of articles on the web about eating rocks as it is so self-evidently a bad idea. 
There is, however, a well-read satirical article from The Onion about eating rocks. And so Google’s AI based its summary on what was popular, not what was true.

Another problem is that generative AI tools don’t have our values. They’re trained on a large chunk of the web. 
And while sophisticated techniques (that go by exotic names such as “reinforcement learning from human feedback” or RLHF) are used to eliminate the worst, it is unsurprising they reflect some of the biases, conspiracy theories and worse to be found on the web. Indeed, I am always amazed how polite and well-behaved AI chatbots are, given what they’re trained on.
Is this the future of search?
If this is really the future of search, then we’re in for a bumpy ride. Google is, of course, playing catch-up with OpenAI and Microsoft. 
The financial incentives to lead the AI race are immense. Google is therefore being less prudent than in the past in pushing the technology out into users’ hands. 
In 2023, Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said:

We’ve been cautious. There are areas where we’ve chosen not to be the first to put a product out. We’ve set up good structures around responsible AI. You will continue to see us take our time.

That no longer appears to be so true, as Google responds to criticisms that it has become a large and lethargic competitor.
A risky move
It’s a risky strategy for Google. It risks losing the trust that the public has in Google being the place to find (correct) answers to questions. 
But Google also risks undermining its own billion-dollar business model. If we no longer click on links, just read their summary, how does Google continue to make money?
The risks are not restricted to Google. I fear such use of AI might be harmful for society more broadly. Truth is already a somewhat contested and fungible idea. AI untruths are likely to make this worse. 
In a decade’s time, we may look back at 2024 as the golden age of the web, when most of it was quality human-generated content, before the bots took over and filled the web with synthetic and increasingly low-quality AI-generated content. 
Has AI started breathing its own exhaust?
The second generation of large language models are likely and unintentionally being trained on some of the outputs of the first generation. And lots of AI startups are touting the benefits of training on synthetic, AI-generated data. 
But training on the exhaust fumes of current AI models risks amplifying even small biases and errors. Just as breathing in exhaust fumes is bad for humans, it is bad for AI. 
These concerns fit into a much bigger picture. Globally, more than US$400 million (A$600 million) is being invested in AI every day. And governments are only now just waking up to the idea we might need guardrails and regulation to ensure AI is used responsibly, given this torrent of investment. 
Pharmaceutical companies aren’t allowed to release drugs that are harmful. Nor are car companies. But so far, tech companies have largely been allowed to do what they like.

We found over 300 million young people had experienced online sexual abuse and exploitation over the course of our meta-study,https://theconversation.com/we-found-over-300-million-young-people-had-experienced-online-sexual-abuse-and-exploitation-over-the-course-of-our-meta-study-229039,3020750,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Online safety, End-to-end encryption, Child sexual exploitation, Insights series, Online Safety Act","
It takes a lot to shock Kelvin Lay. My friend and colleague was responsible for setting up Africa’s first dedicated child exploitation and human trafficking units, and for many years he was a senior investigating officer for the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre at the UK’s National Crime Agency, specialising in extra territorial prosecutions on child exploitation across the globe.
But what happened when he recently volunteered for a demonstration of cutting-edge identification software left him speechless. Within seconds of being fed with an image of how Lay looks today, the AI app sourced a dizzying array of online photos of him that he had never seen before – including in the background of someone else’s photographs from a British Lions rugby match in Auckland eight years earlier.
“It was mind-blowing,” Lay told me. “And then the demonstrator scrolled down to two more pictures, taken on two separate beaches – one in Turkey and another in Spain – probably harvested from social media. They were of another family but with me, my wife and two kids in the background. The kids would have been six or seven; they’re now 20 and 22.”

The AI in question was one of an arsenal of new tools deployed in Quito, Ecuador, in March when Lay worked with a ten-country taskforce to rapidly identify and locate perpetrators and victims of online child sexual exploitation and abuse – a hidden pandemic with over 300 million victims around the world every year.
That is where the work of the Childlight Global Child Safety Institute, based at the University of Edinburgh, comes in. Launched a little over a year ago in March 2023 with the financial support of the Human Dignity Foundation, Childlight’s vision is to use the illuminating power of data and insight to better understand the nature and extent of child sexual exploitation and abuse.


This article is part of Conversation Insights
The Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.

I am a professor of international child protection research and Childlight’s director of data, and for nearly 20 years I have been researching sexual abuse and child maltreatment, including with the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault and Unicef.
The fight to keep our young people safe and secure from harm has been hampered by a data disconnect – data differs in quality and consistency around the world, definitions differ and, frankly, transparency isn’t what it should be. Our aim is to work in partnership with many others to help join up the system, close the data gaps and shine a light on some of the world’s darkest crimes.
302 million victims in one year
Our new report, Into The Light, has produced the world’s first estimates of the scale of the problem in terms of victims and perpetrators. 
Our estimates are based on a meta-analysis of 125 representative studies published between 2011 and 2023, and highlight that one in eight children – 302 million young people – have experienced online sexual abuse and exploitation in a one year period preceding the national surveys. 
Additionally, we analysed tens of millions of reports to the five main global watchdog and policing organisations – the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P), the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), and Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation database (ICSE). This helped us better understand the nature of child sexual abuse images and videos online.
While huge data gaps mean this is only a starting point, and far from a definitive figure, the numbers we have uncovered are shocking.
We found that nearly 13% of the world’s children have been victims of non-consensual taking, sharing and exposure to sexual images and videos.
In addition, just over 12% of children globally are estimated to have been subject to online solicitation, such as unwanted sexual talk which can include non-consensual sexting, unwanted sexual questions and unwanted sexual act requests by adults or other youths.
Cases have soared since COVID changed the online habits of the world. For example, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reported in 2023 that child sexual abuse material featuring primary school children aged seven to ten being coached to perform sexual acts online had risen by more than 1,000% since the UK went into lockdown. 
The charity pointed out that during the pandemic, thousands of children became more reliant on the internet to learn, socialise, and play and that this was something which internet predators exploited to coerce more children into sexual activities – sometimes even including friends or siblings over webcams and smartphones.
There has also been a sharp rise in reports of  “financial sextortion”, with children blackmailed over sexual imagery that abusers have tricked them into providing – often with tragic results, with a spate of suicides across the world.
This abuse can also utilise AI deepfake technology – notoriously used recently to generate false sexual images of the singer Taylor Swift.
Our estimates indicate that just over 3% of children globally experienced sexual extortion in the past year.
A child sexual exploitation pandemic
This child sexual exploitation and abuse pandemic affects pupils in every classroom, in every school, in every country, and it needs to be tackled urgently as a public health emergency. As with all pandemics, such as COVID and AIDS, the world must come together and provide an immediate and comprehensive public health response.
Our report also highlights a survey which examines a representative sample of 4,918 men aged over 18 living in Australia, the UK and the US. It has produced some startling findings. In terms of perpetrators:

One in nine men in the US (equating to almost 14 million men) admitted online sexual offending against children at some point in their lives – enough offenders to form a line stretching from California on the west coast to North Carolina in the east or to fill a Super Bowl stadium more than 200 times over. 
The surveys found that 7% of men in the UK had admitted the same – equating to 1.8 million offenders, or enough to fill the O2 area 90 times over and by 7.5% of men in Australia (nearly 700,000).
Meanwhile, millions across all three countries said they would also seek to commit contact sexual offences against children if they knew no one would find out, a finding that should be considered in tandem with other research indicating that those who watch child sexual abuse material are at high risk of going on to contact or abuse a child physically.

The internet has enabled communities of sex offenders to easily and rapidly share child abuse and exploitation images on a staggering scale, and this in turn, increases demand for such content among new users and increases rates of abuse of children, shattering countless lives.
In fact, more than 36 million reports of online sexual images of children who fell victim to all forms form of sexual exploitation and abuse were filed in 2023 to watchdogs by companies such as X, Facebook, Instagram, Google, WhatsApp and members of the public. That equates to one report every single second.
Quito operation
Like everywhere in the world, Ecuador is in the grip of this modern, transnational problem: the rapid spread of child sexual exploitation and abuse online. It can see an abuser in, say, London, pay another abuser in somewhere like the Philippines to produce images of atrocities against a child that are in turn hosted by a data centre in the Netherlands and dispersed instantly across multiple other countries.
When Lay – who is also Childlight’s director of engagement and risk – was in Quito in 2024, martial law meant a large hotel normally busy with tourists flocking for the delights of the Galápagos Islands, was eerily quiet, save for a group of 40 law enforcement analysts, researchers and prosecutors who had more than 15,000 child sexual abuse images and videos to analyse.
The cache of files included material logged with authorities annually, content from seized devices, and from Interpol’s International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE) database database. The files were potentially linked to perpetrators in ten Latin American and Caribbean countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Peru and the Dominican Republic.

Child exploitation exists in every part of the world but, based on intelligence from multiple partners in the field, we estimate that a majority of Interpol member countries lack the training and resources to properly respond to evidence of child sexual abuse material shared with them by organisations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC is a body created by US Congress to log and process evidence of child sexual abuse material uploaded around the world and spotted, largely, by tech giants. However, we believe this lack of capacity means that millions of reports alerting law enforcement to abuse material are not even opened.
The Ecuador operation, in conjunction with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) and US Homeland Security, aimed to help change that by supporting authorities to develop further skills and confidence to identify and locate sex offenders and rescue child victims.
Central to the Quito operation was Interpol’s database database that contains around five million images and videos that specialised investigators from more than 68 countries use to share data and co-operate on cases.
Using image and video comparison software – essentially photo ID work that instantly recognises the digital fingerprint of images – investigators can quickly compare images they have uncovered with images contained in the database. The software can instantly make connections between victims, abusers and places. It also avoids duplication of effort and saves precious time by letting investigators know whether images have already been discovered or identified in another country. So far, it has helped identify more than 37,900 victims worldwide.
Lay has significant field experience using these resources to help Childlight turn data into action – recently providing technical advice to law enforcement in Kenya where successes included using data to arrest paedophile Thomas Scheller. In 2023, Scheller, 74, was given an 81-year jail sentence. The German national was found guilty by a Nairobi court of three counts of trafficking, indecent acts with minors and possession of child sexual abuse material.

But despite these data strides, there are concerns about the inability of law enforcement to keep pace with a problem too large for officers to arrest their way out of. It is one enabled by emerging technological advances, including AI-generated abuse images, which threaten to overwhelm authorities with their scale. 
In Quito, over a warming rainy season meal of encocado de pescado, a tasty regional dish of fish in a coconut sauce served with white rice, Lay explained:

This certainly isn’t to single out Latin America but it’s become clear that there’s an imbalance in the way countries around the world deal with data. There are some that deal with pretty much every referral that comes in, and if it’s not dealt with and something happens, people can lose their jobs. On the opposite side of the coin, some countries are receiving thousands of email referrals a day that don’t even get opened.

Now, we are seeing evidence that advances in technology can also be utilised to fight online sexual predators. But the use of such technology raises ethical questions.
Contentious AI tool draws on 40 billion online images
The powerful, but contentious AI tool, that left Lay speechless was a case in point: one of multiple AI facial recognition tools that have come onto the market, and with multiple applications. The technology can help identify people using billions of images scraped from the internet, including social media.
AI facial recognition software like this has reportedly been used by Ukraine to debunk false social media posts, enhance safety at check points and identify Russian infiltrators, as well as dead soldiers. It was also reportedly used to help identify rioters who stormed the US capital in 2021. 
The New York Times magazine reported on another remarkable case. In May 2019, an internet provider alerted authorities after a user received images depicting the sexual abuse of a young girl.
One grainy image held a vital clue: an adult face visible in the background that the facial recognition company was able to match to an image on an Instagram account featuring the same man, again in the background. This was in spite of the fact that the image of his face would have appeared about half the size of a human fingernail when viewing it. It helped investigators pinpoint his identity and the Las Vegas location where he was found to be creating the child sexual abuse material to sell on the dark web. That led to the rescue of a seven-year-old girl and to him being sentenced to 35 years in jail.
Meanwhile, for its part, the UK government recently argued that facial recognition software can allow police to “stay one step ahead of criminals” and make Britain’s streets safer. Although, at the moment, the use of such software is not allowed in the UK.
When Lay volunteered to allow his own features to be analysed, he was stunned that within seconds the app produced a wealth of images, including one that captured him in the background of a photo taken at the rugby match years before. Think about how investigators can equally match a distinctive tattoo or unusual wallpaper where abuse has occurred and the potential of this as a crime-fighting tool is easy to appreciate. 
Of course, it is also easy to appreciate the concerns some people have on civil liberties grounds which have limited the use of such technology across Europe. In the wrong hands, what might such technology mean for a political dissident in hiding for instance? One Chinese facial recognition startup has come under scrutiny by the US government for its alleged role in the surveillance of the Uyghur minority group, for example.
Role of big tech
Similar points are sometimes made by big tech proponents of end-to-end encryption on popular apps: apps which are also used to share child abuse and exploitation files on an industrial scale – effectively turning the lights off on some of the world’s darkest crimes.
Why – ask the privacy purists – should anyone else have the right to know about their private content?
And so, it may seem to some that we have reached a Kafkaesque point where the right to privacy of abusers risks trumping the privacy and safety rights of the children they are abusing.
Clearly then, if encryption of popular file sharing apps is to be the norm, a balance must be struck that meets the desire for privacy for all users, with the proactive detection of child sexual abuse material online.
Meta has shown recently that there is potential for a compromise that could improve child safety, at least to some extent. Instagram, described by the NSPCC recently as the platform most used for grooming, has developed a new tool  aimed at blocking the sending of sexual images to children – albeit, notably, authorities will not be alerted about those sending the material. 
This would involve so-called client-side scanning which Meta believes undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption – that only the sender and recipient know about the contents of messages. Meta has said it does report all apparent instances of child exploitation appearing on its site from anywhere in the world to NCMEC.
One compromise with the use of AI to detect offenders, suggests Lay, is a simple one: to ensure it can only be used under strict licence of child protection professionals with appropriate controls in place. It is not “a silver bullet”, he explained to me. AI-based ID will always need to be followed up by old fashioned police work but anything that can “achieve in 15 seconds what we used to spend hours and hours trying to get” is worthy of careful consideration, he believes.
The Ecuador operation, combining AI with traditional work, had an immediate impact in March. ICMEC reports that it led to a total of 115 victims (mainly girls and mostly aged six-12 and 13-15) and 37 offenders (mainly adult men) positively identified worldwide. Within three weeks, ICMEC said 18 international interventions had taken place, with 45 victims rescued and seven abusers arrested.

One way or another, a compromise needs to be struck to deal with this pandemic.

Child sexual abuse is a global public health crisis that is steadily worsening thanks to advancing technologies which enable instantaneous production and limitless distribution of child exploitation material, as well as unregulated access to children online.

These are the words of Tasmanian, Grace Tame: a remarkable survivor of childhood abuse and executive director of the Grace Tame Foundation which works to combat the sexual abuse of children.
“Like countless child sexual abuse victim-survivors, my life was completely upended by the lasting impacts of trauma, shame, public humiliation, ignorance and stigma. I moved overseas at 18 because I became a pariah in my hometown, didn’t pursue tertiary education as hoped, misused alcohol and drugs, self-harmed, and worked several minimum wage jobs”. Tame believes that “a centralised global research database is essential to safeguarding children”.
If the internet and technology brought us to where we are today, the AI used in Quito to save 45 children is a powerful demonstration of the power of technology for good. Moreover, the work of the ten-country taskforce is testament to the potential of global responses to a global problem on an internet that knows no national boundaries.
Greater collaboration, education, and in some cases regulation and legislation can all help, and they are needed without delay because, as Childlight’s mantra goes, children can’t wait.

"Noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs and earmuffs â do they really help neurodivergent people?",https://theconversation.com/noise-cancelling-headphones-earplugs-and-earmuffs-do-they-really-help-neurodivergent-people-230113,3020749,"ear plugs, Sensory processing, Auditory processing, Headphones, Disability coverage","
Noise can make it hard to concentrate, especially for people who are extra sensitive to it.  
Neurodivergent people (such as those who are autistic or have attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder – ADHD) can experience different sensory sensitivities. Their nervous system may process information differently when they are exposed to sensory experiences such as bright lights, loud noise, strong smells or busy environments. 
Decreased sound tolerance is estimated to affect up to 70% of autistic people and is described in three ways: hyperacusis (perceiving everyday sounds as loud or painful), misophonia (an aversion to specific sounds) and phonophobia (fear of a specific sound). As a sensory feature of autism, decreased sound tolerance may have the largest overall impact on quality of life.  
Many autistic or ADHD people describe how noise stops or limits their day-to-day activities such as attending classes, work meetings, socialising or even health care.





In the overall population, we know too much noise can lead to poorer physical and psychological health. Unwanted or unexpected noise can cause irritation, anxiety, anger and restlessness.
Noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs and earmuffs are often recommended or marketed to help manage noise sensitivities. But do they actually make a difference? 
How they work
Different devices work in different ways. Most earplugs and earmuffs simply act as a barrier to block or muffle sound. Noise-cancelling headphones (and now some in-ear devices) can reduce unwanted sound by using active noise-control engineering. 
Sound travels in waves into the eardrum, where it vibrates. Noise-cancelling headphones use tiny microphones to send another sound wave which is exactly the opposite of the incoming sound. The opposing forces reduce the vibration in the ear. This process is called phase cancellation.
There are a range of noise-cancelling devices available for use in different settings and situations from parenting and social gatherings, to sleep and deep focus, to school, concerts or festivals. They may be recommended by health professionals, often occupational therapists whose role it is to find ways people can participate in everyday activities. There is a small amount of evidence to support their use.
In one study, researchers interviewed 17 autistic adults about their public transport use. Most said they used coping strategies to avoid too much noise stimuli. They did this by listening to music or using noise-cancelling headphones. They felt this prevented sensory overload and stress. It followed an earlier pilot study of 16 school children, which found earmuffs and noise-cancelling headphones helped them in the classroom. 

Their usefulness based on what others observe
Other research has explored people’s feelings about the usefulness of noise-cancelling headphones for autistic children and adults. 
A 2019 study explored how autistic children and teens joined in everyday life at home and school when wearing noise-cancelling headphones. Parents and teachers said the kids were able to pay attention and focus, and had a better ability to stay calm when wearing them. 
The autistic children in the study were also able to participate in loud activities at school without noise-related anxiety or stress. Some teachers were concerned that wearing headphones could be stigmatising for children and they may not be able to hear instructions. 
Another study surveyed more than 250 speech pathologists, audiologists and teachers about the pros and cons of autistic children using noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs or earmuffs. 
High rates of device use were reported and 40% of those surveyed thought the devices may allow for better participation in classroom lessons, social situations and recreational activities. They were uncertain about the benefits and potential downsides overall, including any reductions in the amount of speech heard and spoken. However, almost half of respondents believed headphone use would be more likely to increase listening skills and vocabulary diversity.  
Noise-cancelling headphones were included as part of a sensory toolkit to support autistic children’s access to health care in a 2019 American study. Over 2,580 patient visits, more than 1,640 children aged 3 to 18 were flagged with sensory sensitivities and given a kit. Families universally reported improvements in their children’s care when the kits were used.
While research from the perspectives of parents, teachers and health professionals is useful, more research which centres the voices and perspectives of neurodivergent children and adults is required to really understand the effectiveness of these devices. 

4 features to consider
So, while acknowledging limited evidence and some potential downsides, noise-cancelling headphones, earplugs and earmuffs may be an accessible and relatively cheap option to reduce noise stimuli and stress. 
In selecting between noise cancelling headphones, earplugs or earmuffs, people may need to think about:

the wearer’s ability to tolerate earplugs within the ear. If they are sensitive to touch, headphones or earmuffs may be easier to tolerate
the desired noise cancelling level. Different devices will provide different levels of noise reduction, so it’s important to consider whether the person will need to be able to hear speech (such as for school or work)
how they look. Earplugs may be more subtle and difficult to see as they are positioned mostly within the ear
storage when not in use. If headphones or earplugs are for use at school or in the workplace, they may be removed at different times during the day. A storage case can ensure they don’t get lost or damaged. 

Finding useful devices to help neurodivergent people cope with sensory input and support access to the community is very important. More research is needed into the benefits of headphones, earplugs or earmuffs for wearers and to explore any potential risks.  
In addition, more thought and consideration should be given to the universal design of buildings and public spaces in relation to sensory experiences. This can make everyday activities more inclusive for everyone.

"Riverdance at 30: how Riverdance shaped Irish dance, and reflected a multicultural Australia",https://theconversation.com/riverdance-at-30-how-riverdance-shaped-irish-dance-and-reflected-a-multicultural-australia-229010,3020664,"Ireland, History, Dance, Irish diaspora","
Ireland won the 1994 Eurovision Song Contest, but their victory was overshadowed by the seven-minute interval “filler” that received a standing ovation. 
The combined talents of Jean Butler, Michael Flatley and their supporting cast showcased Irish dance in a new, exciting way in an item called Riverdance. And the world – including Australia – took notice. 
Thirty years later, Riverdance still circles the globe, with several troupes touring in different locations. So, does Riverdance matter in Australia? Yes, I believe it does.
The Irish in Australia
Australia has had a significant Irish-heritage population since the 1788 arrival of the First Fleet.





Throughout the 19th century, signs saying “No Irish Need Apply” were common in job advertisements.
The 20th century saw some improvement, but comedians continued to promote the idea Irish people had low intelligence and were often drunk. 

Performing or watching Irish dance was a way of sticking together and celebrating Irishness. Records of Irish dance in Australia date back to the early 19th century, with the first mention of an Irish dancing teacher in Sydney in an Australian newspaper published in 1829. 
The folk music revival of the 1960s and ‘70s, when Irish artists such as The Chieftains became globally popular, brought positive change to perceptions of Irish people both here and worldwide.

Riverdance themes of migration and feelings of longing for the former homeland struck a chord with Australians who have Irish heritage, and there was a surge in popularity of Irish dance.
An evolving dance form
Riverdance showed “traditional” does not have to mean “frozen in the past”; traditional dance can be adapted for modern audiences. 
Irish dance has always been a malleable art form. While there is evidence of it in the 17th century, most records date from the 19th century when it became competitive. 

A video from 1929 shows dancers keeping their feet low and dancing within a small space. 
By the 1980s, the style was more athletic, with the feet sometimes coming above knee level. 

In 1994, Riverdance put a whole lot of new ideas into the seven-minute performance.
One important change was Flatley bursting onto the stage using his arms in a way never seen before in competition dancing. Until then, dancers kept straight arms by their sides. Suddenly, restraint was blown away.
Traditionally males wore kilts in competitions, which did little to attract boys to Irish dance either in Ireland or Australia. The Riverdance men wore black trousers. Irish dance was depicted as an activity in which men and boys can participate, excel at – and even look sexy while performing. 

The women also wore new outfits. Instead of restrictive heavy competition costumes, Riverdance put women into short, body-hugging dresses.
The first full-length production of Riverdance was performed in Dublin in 1995, and first toured Australia in March 1997. 
Most elements of Riverdance have remained constant since those first performances. But the cast has changed many times and is now truly international, including Morgan Bullock, the first African American cast member. 

But while Riverdance is very similar to its first performances, the popularity of the production has led to changes in Irish dance.
Riverdance resulted in higher enrolments in Irish dance classes in both Ireland and Australia.   
The larger numbers of competitors has driven many changes in the style of competition dancing because the more dancers there are, the more difficult it is to win. Competitors are increasingly introducing new elements – such as more complex steps and innovatively designed costumes (within prescribed competition guidelines) to attract the judges’ attention.
A multicultural artform
People of all ages and cultural backgrounds filled Margaret Court Arena, Melbourne, last month when I attended a performance. Riverdance stills draws large audiences 30 years on, provides a rare opportunity for Australians to witness a culturally-specific dance on a concert stage. 
Many immigrant communities in Australia have dance groups and generally, group members belong to that community. Until the mid-1990s, Irish dance behaved the same way; it remained within the Irish community. 
Post-Riverdance, that cultural boundary fell away: anyone could learn Irish dance and excel at it.

At 30, Riverdance still demonstrates the spirit of multiculturalism: one of the many cultures in Australia’s population being publicly celebrated, with numerous Australian dancers having been in the cast over the years. 
Riverdance matters in Australia because it weaves a thread into Irish-Australian history and attracts many people to the art of dance, as performers and audience members. While other dance works come and go on the world’s concert stages, Riverdance has been a constant presence for three decades.
It is still unmistakably Irish dance but is performed and witnessed by people from many backgrounds. A rare feat, indeed.

"Magic mushrooms may one day treat anorexia,Â but not just yet",https://theconversation.com/magic-mushrooms-may-one-day-treat-anorexia-but-not-just-yet-230391,3020627,"Eating disorders, Anorexia, Health, Magic mushrooms, Anorexia nervosa, Psilocybin, Health research, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Anorexia nervosa is a severe mental health disorder where people fear weight gain. Those with the disorder have distorted body image and hold rigid beliefs their body is too big. They typically manage this through restricted eating, leading to the serious medical consequences of malnutrition.  
Anorexia has one of the highest death rates of any mental illness. Yet there are currently no effective drug treatments and the outcomes of psychotherapy (talk therapy) are poor. So we’re desperately in need of new and improved treatments.
Psilocybin, commonly known as magic mushrooms, is one such novel treatment. But while it shows early promise, you won’t see it used in clinical practice just yet – more research is needed to test if it’s safe and effective.
What does treatment involve?
The treatment involves the patient taking a dose of psilocybin in a safe environment, which is usually a specifically set up clinic. The patient undergoes preparation therapy before the dosing session and integration therapy after. 





Psilocybin, extracted from mushrooms, is a psychedelic, which means it can produce altered thinking, sense of time and emotions, and can often result in hallucinations. It also has the potential to shift patients out of their rigid thinking patterns.
Psilocybin is not administered alone but instead with combined structured psychotherapy sessions to help the patient make sense of their experiences and the changes to their thinking. This is an important part of the treatment.
What does the research show?
Research has shown improved effects of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy after one or two dosing sessions, a couple of weeks apart. Most research to date has targeted depression.
Psilocybin has been found to increase cognitive flexibility – our ability to adjust our thinking patterns according to changing environments or demands. This is one of the ways researchers believe psilocybin might improve symptoms for conditions such as depression and alcohol use disorder, which are marked by rigid thinking styles.
People with anorexia similarly struggle with rigid thinking patterns. So researchers and clinicians have recently turned their attention to anorexia.
In 2023, a small pilot study of ten women with anorexia was published in the journal Nature Medicine. It showed psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (with 25mg of psilocybin) was safe and acceptable. There were no significant side effects and participants reported having valuable experiences. 
Although the trial was not a formal efficacy trial, 40% of the patients did have significant drops in their eating disorder behaviour.
However, the trial only had one dosing session and no long-term follow up, so further research is needed.

A recent animal study using rats examined whether rigid thinking could be improved in rats when given psilocybin. After the psilocybin, rats gained weight and had more flexible thinking (using a reversal learning task).
These positive changes were related to the serotonin neurotransmitter system, which regulates mood, behaviour and satiety (feeling full). 
Brain imaging studies in humans show serotonin disturbances in people with anorexia. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is showing promise at modifying the serotonin disturbances and cognitive inflexibility that have been shown to be problematic in anorexia.

Research with animals can provide unique insights into the brain which can sometimes not be investigated in living humans. But animal models can never truly mimic human behaviour and the complex nature of chronic mental health conditions.
What’s next for research?
Further clinical trials in humans are very much needed – and are underway from a research team at the University of Sydney and ours at Swinburne.
Our trial will involve an initial 5mg dose followed by two subsequent doses of 25mg, several weeks apart. An initial low dose aims to help participants prepare for what is likely to be a new and somewhat unpredictable experience. 
Our trial will examine the usefulness of providing psychotherapy that directly addresses body image disturbance. We are also investigating if including a family member or close friend in the treatment increases support for their loved one.

Data from other mental health conditions has suggested that not everyone sees benefits, with some people having bad trips and a deterioration in their mental health. So this treatment won’t be for everyone. It’s important to work out who is most likely to respond and under what conditions.
New trials and those underway will be critical in understanding whether psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is a safe and effective treatment for anorexia, and the optimal conditions to improve the patient’s response. But we are some way off from seeing this treatment in the clinic. One of the big issues being the cost of this intervention and how this will be funded.

Curious Kids: why can some plastics be recycled but others canât?,https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-why-can-some-plastics-be-recycled-but-others-cant-229270,3020626,"Plastic, Curious Kids, Plastic pollution, Plastic recycling, Waste crisis","

Why can some plastics be recycled but others can’t? 
– Jessica, age ten, Sydney

Great question Jessica! We use lots of plastic in Australia and it’s frustrating to find out how little is recycled. 
I work at a university with a team trying to find new ways for people to use less plastic, recycle more and not waste anything. So this is a question I think about a lot.
Basically, some plastics can be recycled because they are easy to melt down and make into other products. Others can’t be, or they contain extra ingredients that make them hard to recycle, such as dyes or chemicals that stop them catching fire. 
But even if you could recycle the plastic, then you have a whole new problem: you have to find someone who will buy the recycled material to make new products.






There are many different types of plastic
Have you ever wondered why the plastic used to make soft drink bottles looks and feels so different to the plastic used for other types of containers – such as yoghurt tubs, lunch boxes or even plastic bags?
It turns out there’s more than one type of plastic. We classify plastic into seven main types. But there are many more when you consider all the mixtures and new or unusual varieties. 
The raw material is almost always fossil fuels (oil or gas). Although these days, people can also make plastic from plants such as corn. 
Either way, plastic is “synthetic”, which means it’s not natural. Long chains of molecules are stitched together to make “polymers” (from the Greek “poly”, meaning many, and “mer”, meaning parts). Different polymers make different types of plastic. 
Some polymers are easier to recycle because they can be melted down and reshaped into new products. This includes number one on our list of seven main types: “polyethylene terephthalate”, found in soft drink bottles. 
It also includes type number two, the “high-density polyethylene” in some milk bottles, and number five, “polypropylene”, which makes things like yoghurt containers. 
Other plastics such as type number three, “polyvinyl chloride”, found in plumbing pipes, and number six, “polystyrene” such as Styrofoam, are much harder to recycle. That’s mainly because they tend to contain lots of extra ingredients, which makes melting and recycling difficult. 
These extra ingredients can include dyes to make the plastic brightly coloured, or chemicals to stop the plastic catching fire. But these extra ingredients can make it harder for the plastic to be recycled. 

Did you know almost 300 billion plastic coffee cups have made their way to rubbish dumps around the world? These cups were not recycled, because they were made from a mixture of paper lined with plastic. 
It’s hard to separate the plastic from the other materials. This makes it difficult to recycle them. But we can choose to use reusable or compostable coffee cups instead. 
Plastic can also be too dirty to recycle. That’s why you should always rinse plastics before putting them in the recycling bin. 
Here’s a little tip. Check the label on plastic bottles, containers and packaging for the symbol that looks like a triangle made of arrows, with a number in the middle. Read the table below to see what the numbers mean and whether it’s worth putting that plastic in your recycling bin or not. 
Just because there’s a logo on it doesn’t mean it can be recycled. It depends on the recycling services that are available near where you live. 
Look up your local council’s website to see what facilities they have for plastic recycling. If it’s not clear, you could ask your council to explain what they can and can’t recycle.

Will anyone use the recycled plastic and will they pay for it?
But if no one wants to use recycled plastic, then it’s hard to find someone willing to recycle it in the first place.
We need to make it easier for people to sell the plastic they have collected to someone who wants to buy it and turn it into something else.
To make this work, we need:

people to put used plastic in the recycling bin properly
someone willing to collect it
a business that can recycle that type of plastic, and
other businesses that will buy the recycled material. 

In Australia, many people are willing to recycle their plastic and we have good recycling facilities, but there aren’t enough people willing to buy stuff made from all the recycled plastic.
One idea is for governments to make businesses and local councils buy products made from recycled plastic. Then people who make products from recycled plastic will be able to sell them.

NZ is changing faster than the census can keep up â the 4 big trends to watch,https://theconversation.com/nz-is-changing-faster-than-the-census-can-keep-up-the-4-big-trends-to-watch-230537,3020582,"Maori, New Zealand, Population, Immigration, Fertility, Demographics, Net migration","
The first data from the 2023 census will be released on May 29 – and not before time. We will see how successful – or not – the census exercise was in achieving participation and coverage. 
It’s no secret past censuses have faced real challenges. We would not want to see a repeat of the poor return rate and low Māori participation that affected the previous census in 2018. 
Stats NZ has said this latest five-yearly census has counted 99% of the population. But this figure is a combination of those who filled out the census forms (about 4.5 million) and others counted from existing government data (about half a million).
We can also cast forward by looking at the 12 months since the 2023 census was taken. In the year to March 2024, the key indicators are that the New Zealand population has changed significantly from where we were in March 2023.





Fertility continues to decline
In March 2023, the total fertility rate (births per woman) was 1.65 – well below the rate required for population replacement. In March 2024, the rate had dropped again to 1.52, a not inconsiderable decline in a single year. 
Some forecasts had assumed New Zealand might stabilise at around the 1.6 rate. But the latest data show a steady downward trend. Internationally, and in New Zealand, the higher educational credentials of Millennial and Gen Z women, combined with their participation in the paid workforce, are driving this trend. 
Additionally, the economic pressures facing those generations are having an effect. When it comes to decisions about having children, the cost of living, especially housing, and the increasing need for two incomes, are now much greater considerations.
When we reach a fertility rate of 1.3, as seems inevitable, New Zealand will join the ranks of the “lowest low-fertility” countries.
Aside from the actual fertility rate, there is also an absolute decline in births. In March 2024, there were 56,277 live births in New Zealand, compared with 58,707 a year earlier (2,430 fewer births). 
That is why the Ministry of Education is forecasting 30,000 fewer children in the education system by 2032.
New Zealand is now hovering around 56,000 births within a population of 5.3 million. Fifty years ago, in 1974, there were 59,334 births when the population was three million. 

More arriving and many more leaving
The number of immigrant arrivals peaked in December 2023 at 244,763, a net gain of 134,445. Both figures significantly exceed the annual average from 2002 to 2019 of 119,000 arrivals and 27,500 net migration gain. 
As of March 2024, arrival numbers have dropped back to 239,000, with a net migration gain of 111,100. Both numbers are still very high, but it suggests the coming year will see a further decline. 
Still, New Zealand’s population grew last year by 2.8%, with net migration gain accounting for the bulk of it (2.4%). This is a very high annual growth rate compared to most OECD countries.
But the other side of the story is the surge in New Zealanders leaving. In the 12 months to March 2024, 78,200 New Zealand citizens migrated to another country, leaving a net loss of 52,500. 
As Stats NZ notes with a degree of understatement, this exceeds the previous record of 72,400 departures and net loss of 44,400 citizens in the year to February 2012.  
It is not unusual to see a net departure of New Zealand citizens. There was an average annual net migration loss of 26,800 from 2002 to 2013, when numbers were at the previous high. But the causes of the latest outflow deserve further analysis.
Māori near the million mark
Stats NZ confirmed the Māori ethnic population (those who self-identify as Māori) reached 904,100 in December 2023. The annual population increase for Māori was 1.5%. If this trajectory continues, Māori will number one million sometime in the early 2030s.
Māori fertility differs significantly to that of Pākehā. Māori have a much lower median age overall, Māori women have children at a younger age, with more children per mother born on average.
Stats NZ anticipates that by 2043, 21% of all New Zealanders will identify as Māori, up from 17% at the moment. For children, however, 33% will identify as Māori. 
The so-called “kohanga reo generations” will be more immersed in tikanga and te reo, with major implications for New Zealand society and the political landscape.

Asian communities are growing and changing
The high levels of inward immigration will add to those identifying as one of the many Asian communities in Aotearoa New Zealand. (And we really do need to find another way of referring to these communities other than with the catch-all “Asian”). 
Pre-COVID, the largest number of arrivals came from China. In the past two years, India has become the largest source country, followed by the Philippines and then China. To March 2024, there were 49,800 arrivals from India compared to 26,800 from China.
These immigration trends mean the next two decades (to 2043) will see the number of New Zealanders who identify with one of the Asian communities grow to 24% of the total population (25% for children).
For the moment, three-quarters of Asian community members are immigrants (born in another country), and quite a lot is known about them from past research. But it will be interesting to see how those born and educated in New Zealand forge their path, and what they will contribute.
The census tends to briefly focus attention on New Zealand’s changing population. But we need to spend more time putting the pieces together to understand how much the country is really changing. That includes looking at the trends between censuses – a lot can happen in five years, after all.

Spectator racism is still rife in Australiaâs major football codes â new research shows it may even be getting worse,https://theconversation.com/spectator-racism-is-still-rife-in-australias-major-football-codes-new-research-shows-it-may-even-be-getting-worse-230198,3020423,"AFL, Racism, Soccer, NRL, Fandom, Racism in sport, Sports fans, A-league, Sport and Society","
The annual Indigenous rounds in the Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL) celebrate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures. 
These events highlight the contributions of Indigenous players and aim to promote cultural awareness and foster reconciliation. 
Some non-Indigenous sports fans, however, do not appreciate these initiatives. Some, in fact, continue to hurl bigoted abuse at players.
While many people would assume spectator racism is becoming rarer, our new study suggests the opposite is true among Australia’s major male-dominated sporting codes. 






Spectator racism may be getting worse
Some Australian football spectators use the stadium to vent hostile attitudes towards people of colour, whether Indigenous, Pacific Islander, African or Asian.
This realisation prompted us to conduct the first large-scale study of spectator racism in the three major men’s leagues. 
In 2021, we surveyed 2,047 participants from across the AFL, NRL and A-League Men, focusing on those who self-identified as white. We wanted to gather insights on racism as they witnessed and understood it while attending matches. 
We found sobering evidence of the persistence of racism within these spectator communities, despite efforts by sports to combat it: 50% of AFL fans, 36% of NRL spectators and 27% of A-League Men fans had witnessed racist behaviour during their lifetimes.
We asked respondents when they had witnessed racism and, as the table below shows, fans of all codes reported they had seen it at greater levels in the past two years compared to periods before this time. 
This finding suggests fan racism is getting worse in all three sports and in the A-League Men, this reported racism is growing at the fastest rate of the three codes.

Acknowledging the problem
Spectator racism has long been an issue in Australian men’s sports. 
National sport governing bodies acknowledge there is a problem, but have for many years struggled to effectively combat it, either failing to respond resolutely or doing so too slowly. 
In 2021, the Australian Human Rights Commission provided sports with guidelines for addressing spectator racism, and since then penalties for transgressions have become more consistent. 
However, poor behaviour from some fans has hardly disappeared.
Our new research, published in the International Review for the Sociology of Sport, found  spectator racism continues to be present in three major Australian men’s leagues: the AFL, NRL and A-League Men. 
The impact on athletes
The impact of fan racism is brutal for players. 
In recent years, Indigenous footballers Adam Goodes and Latrell Mitchell and Cody Walker have borne the brunt of vitriol like this. 

By comparison, the A-League Men has featured few Indigenous players, but racism towards athletes from migrant backgrounds has certainly been obvious, along with neo-Nazi expressions of white supremacy.
Fan explanations for racism
Many survey respondents contended that spectator racism is learned behaviour, passed down through families or like-minded fans. In that sense, racism is normalised, especially in public places like sports stadiums where barrackers may feel anonymous. 
Most of those surveyed strongly criticised racial prejudice, acknowledging Australia’s history of racism and ongoing examples of bigotry at sport events, with some pointing to even worse behaviour among fans online via social media.
Some fans who opposed racism explained it as a moral failing of individuals, whom they perceived to be “bad apples”. But by focusing solely on individuals, they overlooked wider social influences. 
Racism is acquired behaviour, not just a personal choice, and it arises via institutions such as sport and social practices like barracking at the footy.
Some respondents from our study were comfortable with “casual bigotry” whereby racist comments made in the “heat of the moment” are deemed “banter”. They seemed unaware this permissive attitude allows racist discourses to remain alive.
A minority of respondents were unfazed by any of this, freely admitting their own racist views, declaring a belief that sports, and society, are best served by white power. 
Sport’s response to racism
In the football codes, there is now better awareness of what constitutes racist barracking at games. Greater media coverage of racist incidents, especially via its capture on digital devices, has improved the chance of offenders being exposed, along with potential consequences. 
Just as importantly, the three football leagues have improved their detection measures, such as by anonymous reporting hotlines within stadiums. Indeed, our study showed most fans are aware of mechanisms to report racist (or other discriminatory) behaviour. 
Yet, despite a significant proportion of our survey respondents indicating they had observed inappropriate crowd conduct, just 3% of AFL fans, 2% of NRL fans, and 1% of A-League Men supporters reported using the hotlines. 
So, there is a gap between some white fans witnessing and reporting racist incidents. 
Therefore, while sports leagues have introduced penalties for racism, the effectiveness of these measures is limited by their reliance on witness responses and the complexity of observers providing proof.
What more can be done?
In the context of anti-racism and Australian society, the fight against bigotry must not be left to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and people from culturally diverse backgrounds. 
Prime responsibility lies with white Australians who, after all, are generally privileged to not be objects of racial bigotry. Therefore, white sports fans who reject the ideology of white supremacy, like racist barracking at a game, have the opportunity to demonstrate a sense of solidarity with those who have been the subject of abuse.   
It is often said education can alter racist attitudes. After all, if racism can be learned, surely it can be unlearned. 
That process is certainly worth pursuing but in the short term, the imposition of consequences for inappropriate fan conduct is vital. 
The football codes are finally getting serious about penalties, with lengthy or even life-time bans. 
What is urgently needed, though, is a greater commitment by fans, especially white fans, to report racism when they observe it. Otherwise they’re giving a free kick to bigots.

âEverybody has not wonâ: trickle-down economics was an idiotic idea. How do we fix the inequality it causes?,https://theconversation.com/everybody-has-not-won-trickle-down-economics-was-an-idiotic-idea-how-do-we-fix-the-inequality-it-causes-223296,3020422,"Economics, Inequality, Economic History, Book reviews, tax policy, Billionaires, Trickle-down economics","
In his 2024 State of the Union address, US president Joe Biden announced his plans for a bold set of tax reforms. Tax on corporations would go up. Deductions for high-income earners would come down. Tax breaks on corporate jets would take a hit. Low-income taxpayers would benefit, as would middle-income house buyers. 
Most controversially, Biden called for a “billionaire tax”. He planned to raise US$500 billion over ten years by imposing a minimum 25% tax on Americans whose wealth exceeded $100 million. “No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse,” he declared. 
Biden’s proposal was a reversal of Donald Trump’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law in 2017. The act involved significant reductions in tax rates on corporate profits, investment earnings and high personal incomes. Trump described the plan as “the rocket fuel our economy needs to soar higher than ever before”.

As Gods Among Men: A History of the Rich in the West – Guido Alfani (Princeton University Press); Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth – Ingrid Robeyns (Allen Lane)

The polarisation of tax policy between Trump and Biden can be traced back at least 40 years. In the 1980s, the world’s economies were shaken up by the idea that if big corporations and wealthy individuals were taxed less and freed from the encumbrance of government regulations, they would grow the economy and people of all socioeconomic groups would be better off financially. 
It was dubbed “trickle-down economics”. The story was that through a natural process, some of the wealth created by and for those at the top would trickle down through the rest of the economy, so everyone would benefit from liberating the economic might of the wealthy.
Of course, everybody has not won. Since the advent of the global neoliberal experiment in the 1980s, the world has become increasingly divided into rich and poor. Economic inequality has soared to new heights. 
Things have got so bad globally that the World Bank declared 2023 “the year of inequality”. The losses people have suffered as a result of COVID-19, climate change, political conflict and inflation have fuelled the fire of raging inequality. Political populism around the world fans that flame. 
Since 2017’s tax act, the collective wealth of American billionaires grew by a staggering $2.2 trillion. If reelected into the US presidency, Trump promises to do it again next year. He has committed to slashing billionaire tax rates even further.

While the US is an extreme example, it reflects the dominant trend in fiscal policy across the liberal-democratic world. Among the G20 countries, the highest tax rates have fallen by around a third over the past 40 years. Meanwhile, the share of national income sequestered by the wealthiest 1% has grown by 45%.
The systemic changes made to global economies since the heyday of trickle-down economics have created a world increasingly ruled by billionaires. These billionaires like to take credit for their wealth as “self-made men” (most of them are male). It is not so. Macho hubris aside, today’s billionaires are a consequence of devastating errors in government policy that were made decades ago and are still being prosecuted today. 
Fortunately, an increasing number of people are speaking out against inequality and its overwhelming destructiveness. They are also proposing bold policy measures that can address it. 
Two of these people are Guido Alfani, author of As Gods Among Men: A History of the Rich in the West, and Ingrid Robeyns, author of Limitarianism: The Case Against Extreme Wealth. Their books are very different, but complementary. They help to understand the problem of inequality that billionaires so conspicuously represent, and how the problem might be remedied in the name of justice and shared prosperity. 
Gods among men
Alfani takes on the ambitious project of writing a history of the rich in the West from the Middle Ages to the present day. In doing so, he looks for the commonalities the economic elites shared during this time, as well as the social disquiet their existence provoked. 
Alfani’s writing shows the detail and meticulousness one would expect from a historian. He painstakingly presents facts and arguments, setting out who the rich are, how they have attained wealth, and how society has regarded them through the ages.   

The title of Alfani’s book is especially telling. He takes the phrase “gods among men” from 14th-century French philosopher Nicole Oresme. Oresme was particularly scathing of the rich, arguing that they should be expelled from democratically governed cities because their wealth enabled them to mobilise levels of power not available to other citizens. Indeed, they had so much power they could behave with the sovereign might of a god, unbeholden to earthy laws. 
Wealth, Orseme recognised, is not just about economic inequality but also about political inequality. 
The threat of extreme wealth to the political promise of democracy runs like a red thread through Alfani’s book. He demonstrates that, despite their power, rich people have been treated historically with suspicion and even disdain: considered dubious for their lack of a valuable social role or political contribution. 
The wealthy generally lack understanding or sympathy for the struggles of the less fortunate, choosing instead to moralise their wealth through the pretence to good deeds or merit. As a result, Alfani concludes that wealthy people hold a fragile social position, always running the risk that the majority will turn against them. 
In his book’s final pages, Alfani sums up how expecting benevolence from the rich is not a solution to political and economic inequality. The answer lies in taxation. Political representatives of democratic society must be put in charge of deploying excess resources for the common good. If not, the ultra-wealthy will act “as gods among men, wrecking democratic institutions”.
Are there no limits?
While the two authors do not reference each other, in many ways, Robeyns picks up where Alfani leaves off. The “limitarianism” she proposes is a political system that sets strict limits on how wealthy any individual can be. 

Robeyns opens her book by asking, “can a person be too rich?” With this question, she delves into the ethics of excessive wealth, arguing it should not exist because it legitimatises extreme inequality. Limits should be set such that wealth is capped at a socially agreed amount.
Robeyns clearly states that her idea of limitarianism is not a specific proposal for public policy, but rather a “regulative ideal” that can inform policy direction. The idea is that the wealth held by any individual should be limited by democratic society through government regulation. It is a simple idea, as Robeyns makes clear, yet one that is not easy. 
She proposes three types of action that can be taken to pursue her limitarian idea. 
First, societies should ensure all citizens have decent living standards and genuine equality of opportunity through education, child care and anti-poverty strategies. 
Second, taxation and benefits should be organised so everyone can live a dignified life and excessive economic inequality is prevented. 
Third, societies need to adopt a “limitarian ethos”, so that social values adapt to recognise the value of the social and economic justice that is violated by the existence of extreme wealth.
Robeyns’ broad achievement is to stimulate a discussion about the need to take concrete action against the threat of inequality without limits. Importantly, she is not suggesting societies should aim to eliminate economic inequality altogether. To do so would remove the financial incentives that lead people to work hard, take on responsible jobs, and lead innovation. 
The question is about how much inequality is desirable. Wherever one might stand on this matter, it is hard to argue with the proposition that the current state of the world is well beyond that limit. 

Time for change
Taken together, Alfani and Robeyns yield two critical conclusions. 
The first is that the extreme inequality represented by the ultra-wealthy is a significant social problem, and it is getting worse. The pivotal historical point at which this turn for the worse happened was the advent of globalised neoliberalism some 40 years ago. 
Inequality has since become so ingrained in the contemporary world as “normal” that, for some, it is thought of as a natural outcome of a meritocratic system. For others, inequality is a sad reality that cannot be changed, no matter how unjust and undesirable.
Fortunately, reading Alfani and Robeyns together yields a second conclusion. Their work resists both neoliberal triumphalism and cynicism. Inequality, they show, is a social and historical phenomenon, therefore it is not immutable. 
Change towards greater justice may be difficult, but there is no reason to believe it is impossible. We know now definitively that the idea of a trickle-down economy is as idiotic an idea as it seems on face value. That people ever accepted it is reason for embarrassment. That some people are still backing it is insulting to all.
Forty years of the neoliberal experiment have created a world of vast and increasing inequality rationalised by the false promises of a global free market. But this can change, and it should change. Most importantly, as these two books attest, there is a growing will to change and to create fairer societies, where the material benefits of the world’s wealth do not accrue to an extreme minority.

"No mullets, no mohawks, no âawkwardly contrasting coloursâ: what are school policies on hair and why do they matter so much?",https://theconversation.com/no-mullets-no-mohawks-no-awkwardly-contrasting-colours-what-are-school-policies-on-hair-and-why-do-they-matter-so-much-229810,3020421,"Schools, Primary school, High school, School uniforms","
A Queensland dad recently took his four-year-old son out of the Gold Coast’s A.B. Paterson College because the school had ordered the boy to cut his long hair. 
“Like other private schools, we have a uniform policy,” school principal Joanne Sheehy said. “Ours is intended to encourage all our students to be well-presented, respectful and unified.”
The story is a familiar one. Disputes over school uniform policies are repeatedly making the media. Frequently, these disputes concern hair. 
This includes students being barred from class photos for “unnaturally” coloured hair or a teacher cutting a student’s long hair.  Students have also been disciplined for wearing cultural hairstyles such as braids, or turning up to school with styles such as mullets. 





These stories are all part of a larger phenomenon I have examined in my new research: school policies on hair often enforce an idea of “good taste” that favour certain norms around gender, class and race. 

My research
My research examines the hair polices of 50 senior high schools in Queensland (for students in Years 11 and 12). 
It looked at what the policies are and how they are justified by schools. 
This sample included government and independent schools. The independent or private schools were divided into Catholic and Protestant schools. 
The schools came from a wide variety of locations, regions and socioeconomic contexts. 
My findings
Hair policies are often a subset of a broader uniform policy that can cover makeup, jewellery, shoes, clothing and appearances in public areas. 
Most schools had general justifications for their overall uniform policies, rather than specific discussion of their hair component. 
These general justifications were around occupational health and safety, sun safety, school culture, school image, equality among students (through a uniform appearance) and legislative compliance or community endorsement (such as approval from their P&C association) 
For example, one private Protestant school said: 

[the school] recognises that during teenage years individuality is often desired and expressed through clothing choice. However, the uniform is a vital representation of the school and its ethos, value base and placement as a private school.

Where schools did talk specifically about hair, they emphasised “standards” and school image and tone. 
As one government school said: 

Undertaking a conservative hairstyle will ensure compliance with the high standards of dress and appearance in place at [this school] and thereby help to maintain a positive tone in the school community and ensure that our primary focus will be centred on learning.

The regulations for hair itself typically focused on acceptable length, colour and styling.  

‘Appropriate’ lengths
There were regulations around hair being too long and too short, and about it being “appropriate” for male and female genders. 
Of the government schools, 15 required long hair to be restrained and one required hair to be no shorter than a number two cut. Few sought to justify this regulation, although six schools did reference health and safety (for example, keeping long hair back during “practical” subjects or as a general safety measure). None explicitly connected this regulation to gender. 
By contrast, private schools were heavily gendered. A total of 25 private schools (13 Catholic and 12 Protestant schools) required long hair to be restrained. Fourteen of these schools only applied this regulation to female students. 
Thirteen schools (five Catholic and eight Protestant), required male students’ hair to be cut short. Appropriate length was often defined in exacting detail, specifying where hair may reach in relation to the student’s earlobes and eyebrows, the shortest blade permitted to cut hair, and whether tucking hair behind the ears was permissible. More lenient schools simply required hair to be clear of the collar.
If the requirement for female students to restrain long hair is cross-referenced with the requirement for male students to have short hair, there were 17 private schools that explicitly linked hair length with gender.

‘Natural’ colours
Schools were particularly concerned with keeping hair colour natural. Sixteen government schools banned “unnatural” hair colours, of which three additionally banned naturally coloured dye and two only permitted naturally coloured dye that “aligned” with the student’s hair. 
As one government school said: 

The hair styles not permitted include, but not limited to […] unnatural hair colours or awkwardly contrasting colours.

Of the 29 private schools that regulated hair, all banned “unnatural” hair colours, of which four additionally banned naturally coloured dye and four only permitted naturally coloured dye that “aligned” with the student’s hair. 
As one Protestant school said: 

Students are not permitted to dye, bleach or colour their hair to create stark contrasts, a colour or multiple colours away from their natural hair colour. All treatments must be subtle, aligned with the student’s natural hair colour and have the effect of being barely noticeable.

In “being barely noticeable”, a student can appear as part of a cohesive whole, united school community – a key value across the three school affiliations.
‘Conservative’ styles
Schools were also concerned to make sure hair was styled in certain ways. It was common to see a stipulation for students to either wear a “conservative” hairstyle or avoid an “extreme” one. 
Government schools also listed a total of 24 unacceptable styles, Catholic schools provided 27 banned styles and Protestant schools listed 30. The table below details the most frequently banned styles, with regulations on length and colour for comparison.
My research found a noticeable difference between regulations on length and colour versus those on style. Across the three types of schools, 45 schools restrict hair colour, representing 90% of the sample. Similarly, 40 schools, or 80% of the sample, ban unrestrained long hair. 
Yet the most frequently banned style, a rat’s tail, was only banned by 14 schools or 28% of the sample. The next most common – undercut and mohawk – were only banned by 13 and 12 schools, respectively. Mullets were specifically banned by nine schools. 
So while there is a general consensus on inappropriate colour and length, there is only minimal consensus on what exact styles are “wrong” for school.



What do these rules really mean?
These policies are presented as objective “rules” and yet hair styles are imbued with social and cultural meanings. Dreadlocks or braids are common ways to wear hair in African cultures, for example. 
The sociocultural connotations are further complicated by who has that haircut. For example, an undercut on a male student may be seen as trendy, on a female student it could be interpreted as a signifier of queer identity.
Then there’s the mullet. While it may be celebrated in national competitions and even seen as fashionable again, it can also signify bogan culture which many schools seem to find undesirable. Elite private schools, in particular, have repeatedly made headlines for banning the style. 
Few of the commonly banned styles are easy to alter around school hours – a student cannot dye, remove dreadlocks, or grow out their hair each morning. So through these policies, the school also controls the students’ hair outside of school hours and in doing so, their gender, sexual, political or cultural identity. 

What should schools do instead
Recent Australian research has called for school policies to be flexible when it comes to gender and culture so all students feel like they belong. 
When schools are reinforcing inflexible ideas about gender, sexuality, culture, race and class they are not including all students. Schools should review their hair policies to: 

remove gendered restrictions
remove culturally exclusionary regulations
question what norms are being privileged and  
limit their impact on student’s bodily autonomy outside of school hours. 

While schools maintain they want to project a certain standard we have to ask what that standard is and why it is projected as an ideal for our communities.

Decriminalization failures show half measures are not enough to address drug use problems and the opioid crisis,https://theconversation.com/decriminalization-failures-show-half-measures-are-not-enough-to-address-drug-use-problems-and-the-opioid-crisis-230762,3019792,"Drug use, Overdose, War on Drugs, Psychoactive substances, Harm reduction, Opioid crisis, Drug decriminalization, drug poisoning","
Ottawa’s recent rejection of the City of Toronto’s request to decriminalize possession of controlled drugs is the latest shoe to drop in the resurgence of conservative anti-drug sentiment sweeping the country, and backtracking on reforms achieved in other jurisdictions.
The announcement, citing concern for public safety, follows much the same script as that of the British Columbia government, which — after decriminalizing in 2023 — recently retreated to ban use in public places due to complaints of rampant drug use and continuing high rates of overdose.
In early April, the state of Oregon went further, recriminalizing drug possession, replacing small fines with probation and up to six months in prison. The state was forced to backtrack on decriminalization measures that were passed in 2020 due to backlash over spiking overdoses during the COVID-19 lockdown period.
Continued deaths due to drug use is all the evidence required to curb reform, despite the fact that these spikes occurred mostly during the pandemic.





Research shows that the pandemic exacerbated many of the factors underlying the drug crisis. Health disparities and a lack of resources in underserved communities, social isolation, economic burden, stress, a lack of access to treatment and barriers to care all contribute to acute health effects of drug dependence. 
Regardless of these facts, drug policy reform is being blamed for these outcomes. 
It’s still all about the politics, of course

In Ontario, predictably, the Ford government’s position on Toronto’s proposal is staunch opposition. Yet there is a sense of new momentum in the same old rhetoric: because drug users continue to die and use drugs in public places, presumably this means the experts and bleeding-heart liberals who supported reform have been soundly proven wrong. 
Most concerning, whereas conservatives and liberals may differ in their emphasis on punishment or treatment as solutions to drug problems, neither type of government seems prepared to fully implement a public health approach to substance use. That would mean addressing health disparities and deeper causes of substance use disorders, such as social inequality and social dislocation in Canadian society.
No North American jurisdiction has been able to achieve this, despite the depth of knowledge and increasingly articulate demonstration of progressive public servants. Bureaucrats and politicians speak the language used by experts and other knowledgeable observers, who in turn inform the public of the need for harm reduction and more comprehensive, meaningful social policy reform. Logically, this requires commitment to decriminalization to shift the emphasis from punishing addicts to rehabilitating them.
Increasingly, the discourse has gone further in establishing the need for more coherent public health policies addressing the root causes of addiction. To that end, important progress has been squandered by apparent bewilderment that addicts are still dying in large numbers, despite (and now because of) decriminalization measures that were never claimed to solve the problem of addiction, but rather to reduce known harms of criminalizing drugs.
Decriminalizing drugs is not intended to be a solution to drug problems. Rather, it is a critical first step that’s necessary, but not sufficient, for replacing prohibition with a public health approach.
Although Canada has made this work for regulating cannabis, it still has far to go to implement a more progressive public health approach to other drugs. The dangers of drug use stem not so much from psychoactive substances themselves, but from the toxic and unsafe drug supply that is the result of criminalization. But most of these substances continue to be treated as dangerous enough to ban.
Yet there is scant consideration of the societal and legal circumstances and conditions that make drugs dangerous because they happen to be used in harmful ways by certain people. Whereas opiates, like alcohol, may have higher risk of overdose and adverse health effects due to physical dependence, all drugs can be misused with risk to health and public safety.
Addiction and public health

Decriminalizing drugs can make them safer, but not always, and reduce some harms of using drugs. What cannot be resolved entirely by decriminalization are the societal conditions that make substance use attractive enough to override considerations of concern for the self or others.
Addiction thrives on hopelessness and feelings of despair, abandonment and disconnection, which are caused by homelessness, unemployment and discrimination, among other social problems. Despite the range of local addiction support services and treatment options called for in support of decriminalization proposals, so far decriminalization efforts have failed to go beyond half measures to implement a full array of integrated resources.
Further off course yet, there has been little indication of meaningful commitment to addressing deeper structural root causes of addiction in North American society. Canada’s putative commitment to a public health approach has fared no better than in Oregon.
None of these jurisdictions have gone far enough to remedy the real causes of drug problems. The fate of Portugal’s successful run as a global leader in tackling addiction, as opposed to punishing addicts, helps to clarify new lessons being learned in North America. 
Adopted over 20 years ago, decriminalization measures in Portugal have been implemented more successfully because its social safety net is far more comprehensive and better integrated with the criminal justice system. In recent years, as cuts to funding decimated rehabilitation programs, rising rates of overdose soon followed, demonstrating that decriminalization is not a silver bullet; if you do that and nothing else, things will get worse.
Put otherwise, half measures are ineffective. Until we are prepared to go all in to solve the problem, people who use drugs will keep dying unnecessarily because we have not afforded them real hope.
Sadly, this is news to no one. Not just experts. The Liberal government went on the record years ago by recognizing that decriminalizing drug use is not a panacea. Rather than committing to the next step, then and now, the necessary first step has been taken off the table.
How about try giving it more time?
Another lesson learned in Portugal, that evidently has not been resonating here in North American society, is that the kind of change required takes time. Now that decriminalization has been tried (and deemed a failure) in B.C. and Oregon, the reigning logic appears to be that going back to doing nothing makes more sense than doing something.
Despite great patience shown during a century of misery inflicted on drug users in Canadian society, trying something new is scary. Cue the same old moral panic scapegoating addicts as dangerous people who those in charge prefer should not be seen.

Decriminalizing drugs can’t eliminate people’s struggles with addiction. To work well, it requires a considerable level of investment, similar to what has historically been devoted to policing and imprisonment of addicts. Redistributing resources to support the integration of services, housing and employment for more people is not, and has never been, prioritized over punishing drug users.
Until that shift occurs, we will keep falling back on failed policies consistent with a war-on-drugs mentality that has now prevailed for 50 years against all logic. In the meantime, be prepared for a new wave of antiquated arguments proclaiming more liberal policies a failure.
Commitment to half measures creates more problems than it solves.

Can marketing classes teach sustainability? 4 key insights,https://theconversation.com/can-marketing-classes-teach-sustainability-4-key-insights-230085,3019791,"Consumerism, Business schools, Business education, Post-secondary education, Climate crisis, UN sustainable development goals (SDG)","
Young adults have an important role to play in achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Adopted by all UN member nations, the SDGs offer a frame for an ambitious plan to transform our world for the better. 
Engaging young adults in meaningful discussions can lead to transformative learning — and action is key to meeting local and global targets.
Universities across Canada and the world are working towards making institutional commitments towards sustainability and engaging students in this also. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization launched a Reflect-Share-Act framework in 2020 to assist anyone in acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to promote sustainable development in their community. 
Over the past two years, I participated in a sustainability fellowship program at the University of Saskatchewan. As part of this, I redesigned a marketing class using the UNESCO framework to include sustainability learning outcomes, activities and assessments.





I used a survey at the start and end of each term to measure changes in student perceptions around sustainability and students’ own belief in their ability to enact change. The results showed consistent increases in terms of knowledge about what sustainability is and student optimism around how to make change happen. 
Many aspects of sustainability
When most people think about sustainability, their first thought is usually about the environment or climate change. However, the UN global goals also address other aspects of sustainability, including:

elimination of poverty (SDG 1);
responsible consumption and production (SDG 12);
gender equality (SDG 5);
and quality education (SDG 4). 


I focused my efforts on an introductory marketing class that I’d taught several times. I introduced sustainable development and the SDGs at the start of the term with the promise of making specific connections to marketing concepts throughout the class. 
Students’ ideas for sustainable behaviours
The focus of marketing often involves persuasion and considering how to drive sales/purchases. When talking about consumer behaviour and revisiting traditional marketing concepts, I shared examples of overconsumption (for example, purchasing water bottles in every new colour that comes out) and asked students to consider how they might reduce their own consumption. 
I pointed students towards a UN resource, The Lazy Person’s Guide to Saving the World for initial ideas — and then asked students to brainstorm actions they could take as marketers to contribute to SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production and other SDGs in their future workplaces. 




      Read more:
      How marketing classes can rescue 'ugly produce' from becoming food waste




Students shared ideas such as evaluating the materials used in packaging and finding new ways to connect with customers to reduce sales-related travel and their own carbon footprint. 

Students were able to think about the impacts of their decisions and identify tangible ways to contribute to sustainable development. Next year I’m going to take the activity a step further by turning their ideas into an open resource for marketers wanting to prioritize sustainability.
Here are some lessons learned from engaging business students in reflecting, sharing and acting on sustainability.
Lesson #1: Lower your defences
I’ve never been good at showing vulnerability. Dominant academic culture is based on having a strong defence and not showing weakness. I’ve found, however, that sharing my uncertainties in the face of global challenges has led to more conversation and connection with students. 
When I talk about worrying about how the world is running out of water, and discuss political and humanitarian issues around water security, I’ve found that students make great efforts to address these by finding solutions that exist now and might be invented in the future. 
It’s OK not to have all the answers and see what happens.
Lesson #2: Authenticity is king (or queen)
Students can be very perceptive. I’ve learned from feedback in course evaluations and informal chats that students pay attention to what I model, and the importance of being authentic. From my choice of clothing to the water bottle I bring to the classroom, these decisions matter to students.  
I have open conversations where I talk about an issue, such as the horrific environmental impacts of fast fashion in Ghana, as narrated in Aja Barber’s book, Consumed: The Need for Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change and Consumerism. Then I talk about my consumption choices in light of this issue. 
It helps students to see the connections between these issues and the everyday (better) choices we can all make.
Lesson #3: Don’t take it personally
I’ve found that some students are cynical about setting sustainability goals. 
It’s not that surprising — after all, I teach in a business school, and there is long-standing discussion about capitalist-forward business schools focussed on maximizing profits at the expense of everything else.
Others are even suspicious of the United Nations. Some refuse to take any responsibility for sustainable development and put it on corporations to solve the world’s problems. 
It’s important not to take criticism personally. I’ve found that going deeper and examining these opinions can lead to interesting discussions. With regards to cynicism about the SDGs, I usually respond with questions such as: “What makes you think that? What have you read that leads you to those conclusions?” 
I’ve learned educators need to listen and learn non-judgmentally about how young people feel. They have valid reasons to react strongly about generations of business leaders who have recklessly pursued wealth with complete disregard for the impacts.

Lesson #4: It’s not just about ‘what’ but about ‘how’
I’ve realized that how I engage with students on important global topics like sustainability is just as important as the content I share. UNESCO has said sustainability education should emphasize experiential, inquiry-based, problem-solving, interdisciplinary systems approaches and critical thinking. 
Approaches need to enable student action and not leave them feeling like the world’s issues are too large for them to tackle. Using this definition along with the Reflect-Share-Act framework, I was able to help students move beyond considering large, often daunting global issues to a place where they can take tangible actions and affect change.

Why are grocery bills so high? A new study looks at the science behind food price reporting,https://theconversation.com/why-are-grocery-bills-so-high-a-new-study-looks-at-the-science-behind-food-price-reporting-230086,3019790,"Food, Food prices, Cost of living, Food industry, Groceries, Food costs, Grocery prices","
Rising food costs are squeezing Canadians around the country. Nearly everyone is feeling the pinch, and it’s not just an inconvenience — high food prices are a major threat to food security for many Canadians. Understanding why food prices are so high and why they are changing is critical to the well-being of our society.
Unfortunately, consensus on why food price are so high is in short supply. Explanations given in reports like Canada’s Food Price Report and the news media range widely, from the war in Ukraine to supply chain issues to the carbon tax. 
Each year it seems the key drivers change, and if the growing consumer boycott of Loblaw’s is any indication, consumers want better answers.
So, we completed a rigorous analysis of the most prominent reports that shape the narratives around food prices in Canada, including twelve years of Canada’s Food Price Reports and 39 reports from Statistics Canada. Our findings, which are peer reviewed and soon to be published in Canadian Food Studies, were both insightful and concerning.





Lacking scientific rigour
Our analysis found that most claims about food prices in these reports lack scientific rigour. Nearly two-thirds of the explanations for price changes given are not backed by evidence. Arguments about the causes of food inflation are frequently incomplete, neglecting to connect the dots between cause and effect. 
For instance, reports may identify the influence of unfavourable weather, climate change or changing retail demand, but fail to elaborate how these translate into actual price increases at the till.

British philosopher Stephen E. Toulmin published a simple approach for evaluating the quality of scientific arguments in 1958. In a nutshell, for a scientific argument to be complete, it needs to have three components: a claim, verifiable observations or data that provide grounds for that claim, and an explicit theory or assumption that links the data logically to the claim.
For scientific arguments to be rigorous, they should also back up the strength of their assumptions and qualify their claims by exploring reasonable counterarguments. However, most of the arguments in these reports fall short of this, failing even to provide basic evidence in support of their claims. 
These reports are not scientific publications, but rather qualify as “grey literature” — information produced outside traditional academic publishing channels. 
Nevertheless, they are published under the logos of academic institutions and government agencies. Given their prominence in Canadian media and policy, we believe it is important for the public to know that the arguments presented in these reports do not live up to scientific standards.
Overlooking key issues
While the reports do identify potential drivers of food prices, they have some noteworthy gaps. 
While extreme weather events and climate change are sometimes offered as abstract reasons for food price increases, some major environmental issues, like biodiversity loss and collapsing fish stocks, do not appear in reports, despite a widespread understanding that they will impact food price and availability. 

These reports also rarely consider the decisions that grocers and other private sector entities have on food prices. Increased consolidation and concentration in the grocery sector is a structural issue that deserves scrutiny. 
The bread price-fixing scandal a few years ago showed how a lack of competition enables price manipulation and hurts consumers. Canada’s Competition Bureau recently announced they are launching an investigation into the owners of Loblaws and Sobeys for alleged anti-competitive conduct.
In the United States, there is also strong evidence that the private sector has been profiteering on supply chain issues and inflation. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission likewise recently found that big grocers used the pandemic as a smokescreen to pad their profits at the public’s expense.

      Food giants reap enormous profits during times of crisis




With grocer profits expanding in Canada, too, it is fair to ask tough questions about how much grocers’ decisions are contributing to the pain at the till. 
In our analysis, only three per cent of the over 200 explanations for food price changes point to grocer actions or other agency in the private sector as driving price increases. This reflects a tendency to portray food prices as erratic and overwhelmingly opaque. 
Other issues — such as the over-reliance on fossil fuels across the supply chain — also go unmentioned.
A new approach is needed
Without rigorous and transparent analysis, we’re left with an incomplete picture of why food is so expensive and what we can do about it. 
What we need is a new approach. Food is a human right, but a unique one in that we rely on the private sector to provision it. We should expect a higher standard than with other consumer goods, and the private sector has arguably not earned the benefit of the doubt given their history of price fixing.
One positive step towards generating trustworthy evidence about food prices  would be to incorporate transparency measures into the code of conduct the Canadian government is developing with grocers. This could include third-party audits, open data-sharing and a clear breakdown of what’s driving price changes — from the farm to the shelf.

      The new Grocery Code of Conduct should benefit both Canadians and the food industry




Peer review of research is a critical aspect of responsible science. In our paper, we highlight the process that the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat provides for federal fisheries science, as one possible model for government-based food price reports.
For something as essential as food, Canadians deserve the full story. For decades, policy and markets have been designed to keep food cheap, but at the expense of workers and the environment. 
If food prices are rising because they are starting to reflect the true social and ecological costs of production, we will need to enter a broader conversation about economic and livelihood reform to ensure that everyone can afford food. But without a clear picture of the actual drivers, we lack the necessary information for developing policies that protect the rights and well-being of Canadians.

Cyberflashing is a form of gendered sexual violence that must be taken seriously,https://theconversation.com/cyberflashing-is-a-form-of-gendered-sexual-violence-that-must-be-taken-seriously-227128,3019789,"Sexting, Rape culture, Consent, Sexual violence, Gender-based violence, Explicit images, Cyberflashing, preventing gender-based violence","
Sexting — sending sexually suggestive or explicit messages and images — is now a widespread practice, and can be a healthy way to express and explore sexuality. However, there is a need to distinguish between consensual sexting and forms of sexual harassment like cyberflashing.
Cyberflashing refers to the act of non-consensually sending sexual imagery (like nudes or “dick pics”) to another person. It is facilitated through communications technologies including text, AirDrop and social media applications like Snapchat and Tinder.
Similar to flashing — when a person unexpectedly and deliberately “flashes” their genitals to others — that occurs in person, cyberflashing involves an intrusive denial of autonomy and control. It can lead to people feeling distressed, objectified and unsafe. 
And like flashing, which involves physical proximity to the person, cyberflashing can occur through location-specific technology like Apple’s AirDrop. A cyberflasher may also access further information about the recipient online, including their name and location.





Cyberflashing is often normalized and perceived as something to laugh off, but it is a form of gender-based sexual violence that must be taken seriously.
My research on technology-facilitated gender-based violence, including non-consensual sexual deepfakes, highlights the need for legal and societal responses to these emerging challenges.
Gendered targets
In 2018, Statistics Canada found that 11 per cent of women and six per cent of men aged 15 or older were sent unwanted sexually suggestive or explicit images or messages. For young people aged 15 to 24, that increased to 25 per cent of women and 10 per cent of men. 
Cyberflashing studies from the United States and the United Kingdom suggest higher rates of cyberflashing, with women still being the most targeted.
While further intersectional data is not available for explicit images, generally women with disabilities, Indigenous women and bisexual women face a high prevalence of online harassment overall.
Cyberflashing can also occur alongside further forms of violence including stalking, sexual harassment and physical threats.

Violating impacts
The impacts of cyberflashing are compounded by contextual factors. In one case, a fire inspector in London, Ont., sent explicit photos to women he worked with. Another factor involves location: for instance, women in Montréal received sexually explicit images while riding the Metro, while British students were cyberflashed during university lectures. 
A study of 2,045 women and 298 gay or bisexual men in the United States found that women reported cyberflashing as a predominantly negative experience that left them feeling grossed out, disrespected and violated.
The same study found that, although gay and bisexual men received high rates of cyberflashing, they reported more positive reactions, showing how gender and sexual orientation may impact experiences of violence. It is important to situate this finding in terms of unequal gender dynamics, social expectations that men should appreciate sexual advances and a broader culture wherein incidents of sexual violence against men who have sex with men are minimized.
The result of cyberflashing is women engaging in “safety work,” including restricting or changing their movements and communication. Such emotional and physical labour is time-consuming and can limit women’s participation in everyday life.
Rape culture
Cyberflashing reflects and reinforces rape culture wherein sexual violence is normalized and consent is viewed as unnecessary. There is an assumption in cyberflashing that the unsolicited sexual content will be positively received despite the lack of consent. 

When heterosexual men were asked what reaction they hoped for from the recipient when cyberflashing, the majority of them said that they were after a positive reactions like sexual excitement and attraction. A significant minority of men, however, sought negative reactions like shock, disgust and fear.
This frequent, mistaken belief from heterosexual men that there will be a positive reaction to cyberflashing may be because they are socialized to be sexually aggressive.
Beyond individual cyberflashing, rape culture in society more broadly results in belittling sexual violence and victim-blaming. This is reflected in advising women to simply ignore unwanted images and in the wrongful assumption that the person must have “asked” to be flashed.
Moving towards consent
Canada can address cyberflashing by exploring criminalization, a method already present in England, Wales, Scotland and Singapore.
Criminalization of cyberflashing serves as a deterrent by making it an illegal act with potential consequences. Currently in Canada, only individuals sending sexual content to youth under 18 may face criminal charges under child luring laws if done with the intent to commit an offence such as sexual exploitation, trafficking and indecent exposure.
However, criminalization is limited, given the lack of cyberflashing reporting. Survivors of sexual violence may also distrust the criminal justice system due to its harmful treatment of survivors, especially survivors who face structural oppressions including anti-Black racism and ableism. 
A promising alternative to criminalization is transformative justice, an approach to addressing harm that focuses on healing, community accountability and societal change.
Another aspect of ending cyberflashing requires the participation of social media platforms, which can use technology, including artificial intelligence, to detect sexual content and block it unless the user decides to accept. This approach is used by Bumble’s Private Detector and Instagram’s Nudity Protection.
Finally, there is a need for sex-positive sex and tech safety education that differentiates sexting from sexual harassment like cyberflashing. Rather than stigmatizing sexting overall, age-appropriate practices should be promoted on how to meaningfully and consensually communicate about sex.

British Columbia needs a unified response to respond to the biodiversity crisis,https://theconversation.com/british-columbia-needs-a-unified-response-to-respond-to-the-biodiversity-crisis-225767,3019788,"Climate change, Conservation, Biodiversity, Canada, Global warming, B.C.","
From massive kelp forests to monumental old-growth on land, British Columbia’s biodiversity — which is unrivalled in Canada — provides an array of cultural, economic, social and other benefits. B.C.’s wide-ranging ecological zones are home to over 70 per cent of Canada’s mammal, bird and non-vascular plant species.
The province is ostensibly proud of having a healthy environment, with its mottos “Splendour without Diminishment” and “Beautiful British Columbia” promoting its natural beauty. Yet despite this awareness, the province is hindered by a fragmented approach to biodiversity management. 
B.C. possesses considerable knowledge resources with a wealth of top biodiversity scientists, biodiversity-based industries and leading conservation organizations. It is also home to over 200 First Nations with traditional knowledge systems closely tied with nature. However, current conservation initiatives lack co-ordination and there is no independent organization or provincial governing body overseeing the many actions underway. This must change.
Unco-ordinated approach
The lack of co-ordination in B.C. makes it difficult to obtain a clear picture of ecosystem health across the province. This murky picture has negative implications for efforts to quantify, forecast and adjust to biodiversity changes — with further knock-on repercussions for efforts to hold people and organizations accountable for infractions.





For example, when a species is listed on Canada’s Species at Risk Act, the first step for legislated action by the province is to map locations of habitats that are necessary for the species’ recovery. But, in part due to poor biodiversity inventories and low engagement across sectors, this information has been regularly delayed, by an average of 9.8 years. This is a costly time frame for an endangered species.
We cannot manage what we do not monitor and this challenge will only get worse as climate change shifts the range of many species.

Biodiversity work in B.C. is currently being performed by a passionate and engaged group of stakeholders, including non-governmental organizations, academics, First Nations, local interest groups, federal and provincial agents as well as private consultancies. 
The breadth of work is vast and, despite having so many different groups involved, the goals are often aligned. Yet despite having similar goals, shared methods and the potential for combining knowledge across projects, fragmentation across individuals and groups persists. 
The fragmented nature of B.C. biodiversity work is a missed opportunity that can lead to gaps and blind spots that ultimately undermine action. Potential interconnected threats like diseases, invasive species, ecological impacts of new developments and a range of other issues may be missed. 
Biodiversity loss is too important to be detected by chance; it should be monitored in a systematic, open and inclusive way. 
New data
New technologies are vastly increasing our capacity to monitor biodiversity. 
Advances in environmental genomics and the discovery that organisms leave traces of their DNA in the environment means biodiversity now can be assessed from samples of water, soil and even the air. NGOs, Indigenous stewards and conservation groups in B.C. are already using environmental DNA (fragments of DNA floating freely in the environment) to track biodiversity change.
Remote automatic cameras deployed in a network can quickly and continuously record the distribution of certain species. What’s more, the data from these cameras can be processed quickly using community science web-based platforms quickly using crowd-sourced knowledge and artificial intelligence. Satellite data can reveal the status of forests across the province. 
We are on the cusp of a deluge in biodiversity data, but data on its own is not knowledge. 

To translate this data into actionable insights, collaboration and co-ordination is key. We need to work together to share knowledge and capacity for understanding change. User-friendly platforms are needed to make the data accessible, but it is equally important to integrate it with existing knowledge held by local communities and Indigenous groups.

Establishing a system of natural capital accounts would provide a clear picture of the value our ecosystems provide empowering decision-makers to understand the economic and social consequences of their choices.  
Meeting our commitments
In December 2022, Canada hosted the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity in Montréal. In response to the Kunming-Montréal Global Biodiversity Framework, Canada committed to protecting 30 per cent of biodiversity by 2030. Canada also committed to developing a plan in response to the framework’s four goals and 23 targets. Yet co-ordinated action is needed at the provincial level to achieve this. 
B.C.’s draft framework for biodiversity and ecosystem health is a positive step with its emphasis on “connecting initiatives,” “providing accessible and credible data” and “fostering innovation, skills, and training” — but much more work is still needed.

We need a body that draws together independent expertise in biodiversity and social sciences with policymakers and interest groups. Importantly, this body would need to be transparent, track progress and provide research and synthesized information to support informed decisions.
Crucially, any effort to co-ordinate biodiversity work in B.C. must inclusively engage with the many ongoing initiatives in the province to ensure it is adding value. 
We may not have to look far for an effective model. Québec recently launched Biodiversité Québec — a partnership across government, scientific and Indigenous partners — to create an integrated monitoring system for nature.
Drawing inspiration from such initiatives and its own capacity, B.C. can rise to the challenge of biodiversity loss. With co-ordination and sustained support of expertise, B.C. can set clear goals, leverage existing initiatives, ensure efforts are aligned and results are communicated and ultimately, ensure that B.C.’s natural splendour remains undiminished.

Banning offenders from changing their names doesnât make us safer,https://theconversation.com/banning-offenders-from-changing-their-names-doesnt-make-us-safer-230283,3019787,"Crime, Rehabilitation, British Columbia, Convicts, Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, Reintegration, Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, name change","
The government of British Columbia recently introduced a bill to ban people convicted of serious offences from legally changing their name. The proposed amendment to the province’s Name Act would also prohibit those found not criminally responsible due to mental disorder from changing their name. 
The government announced the move after media reports that Allan Schoenborn legally changed his name to Ken Johnson. Schoenborn was found not criminally responsible for the deaths of his children in 2010 because of a delusional disorder, and was placed at a psychiatric hospital.
The amendment bill states that a person is not allowed to change their name if:

They have been convicted of a prescribed offence;
They’ve been found to be not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder;
Or if they’ve been found to be a dangerous or long-term offender.

The ban will also apply to children under 18 who have been convicted of a perscribed offence and are sentenced as adults. This proposed ban is unconstitutional. It diverges from the justice system’s mandate of rehabilitation and does not make us safer.






Name change bans
Saskatchewan, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador have banned people convicted of certain sex crimes from changing their names. Ontario has a bill in the standing committee phase and Manitoba has a proposed bill. Alberta extended the ban to dangerous and long-term offenders in 2021.
Under section 15(1) of Canada’s Charter of Rights and Freedoms,

“every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.”

B.C.’s proposed ban has a host of implications for the Charter rights of a wide range of people. This includes people not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder, meaning they were not found guilty. It impacts convicted or not criminally responsible people who are trans seeking a name change to reflect their gender identity. It impacts Indigenous peoples, who are hyper-imprisoned in Canada, who want to reclaim Indigenous names. Facilitating Indigenous name reclamation is listed under the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Call to Action 17. 
Children sentenced as adults have much potential to live long, meaningful lives post-release, but would also be unable to change their name. Children are more likely to engage in risky and impulsive behaviours due to human brain development. It also has implications for convicted gang members trying to break ties or prevent retribution, and people seeking to change their last name after getting married or as part of other religious or spiritual commitment ceremonies.
Undermining reintegration
Changing identity is part of reintegration for many. Desistance means developing a crime-free identity to live a meaningful life as a contributing member of society. It entails recovering one’s “core good self” and constructing a positive narrative about the future. It also means “generativity”; this is, giving back to society. 
Desistance has important connections to preventing recidivism. Barriers to desistance include the difficulty of gaining education, employment, housing and social acceptance. Banning name changes may further isolate convicted people or people found not criminally responsible, making it more difficult or impossible to reintegrate into society.

Canada’s justice system is mandated to support rehabilitation and reintegration. The vast majority of people in prison have a release date and will return to the community after serving time. B.C.’s proposed bill extends punishment beyond the formal sentence, and works against purported goals of rehabilitation and reintegration.
Banning legal name changes will not make us safer. Canada’s criminal legal system has checks in place to assess the potential risk an individual could pose to the public upon and after release, including the parole system. Name changes also do not impact a person’s criminal record, which allows employers, schools and other organizations to learn about someone’s criminal history.
Supporting desistance
Rather than banning name changes in an effort to seek public safety, the focus should be on supporting desistance. To do so means helping people to rejoin society, including wrap-around supports for people who have been convicted or not criminally responsible. 
For example, the non-profit Circles of Support and Accountability is focused on providing social support to help people rejoin communities, but only exists in 15 locations throughout Canada. The program has contributed to a 71 per cent reduction in all forms of recidivism, showing that guided community support greatly improves outcomes for former prisoners. 
Rather than ban name changes in an effort to seek accountability, governments must invest in restorative and transformative justice. Restorative justice focuses on rehabilitation of the person who did harm and reconciliation for their victims. It centres on repairing harm, the potential for healing, meaningful accountability and preventing further offending. 
What meaningful accountability looks like is determined with victims, and the person who did harm is required to acknowledge or accept responsibility for their actions in order to access these programs. 
Overall, name change bans are a step in the wrong direction. To support public safety and accountability, greater investment should be placed in community supported reintegration and restorative and transformative justice options.

Men still dominate Ugandaâs party politics â womenâs participation is mostly cosmetic,https://theconversation.com/men-still-dominate-ugandas-party-politics-womens-participation-is-mostly-cosmetic-230144,3019786,"Parliament, Democracy, Uganda, Patriarchy, Yoweri Museveni, Peace and Security, political parties in Africa, National Resistance Movement, Bobi Wine, National Unity Platform (NUP)","
Electoral gender quotas in Uganda – first introduced in 1989 – have increased women’s numbers in Uganda’s parliament to 34%. Today there are 189 women out of 557 members of parliament. 
But women politicians in Uganda continue to be restricted to minority representation. They are constantly battling stereotypes that seek to maintain the status quo of male dominance in political spaces. The electorate has additionally grown accustomed to believing that since women have seats reserved for them, they should stay out of the race for open seats.
One of the reasons for this continued marginalisation is that the country’s political parties have done little to empower women. Yet they are the first hurdle that women politicians have to clear, not only to get into parliament but to become effective.
The reality is that political party affiliation provides one of the most viable avenues for women’s entry into politics – the alternative would be to vie as an independent candidates with no affiliation to a political party. Party support provides the much-needed financial resources for successful campaigning that women are normally unable to access. Political parties therefore act as gatekeepers by determining who gets into political office. 





Therefore, women – like men – will tend to gravitate towards a party that can provide the financial resources needed to campaign and get into office. In Uganda, this tends to be the National Resistance Movement. The ruling party has been in power for over 30 years, and because of its popularity and apparent control of state resources, it presents the most viable path to parliament. 
I am a scholar of parliamentary politics in Uganda, with a focus on women’s participation. In a recent paper, I set out to study the country’s political parties to identify women’s place in them. I examined the power structures of six of the 26 registered political parties using their documents, such as constitutions, that showed the party structures. I studied the National Resistance Movement, Democratic Party, Forum for Democratic Change, Alliance for National Transformation, Uganda People’s Congress and the National Unity Platform.

      Tanzania’s political parties have few women in leadership and candidate lists: some solutions




My findings show that political parties have a long way to go to improve the position of women in their ranks. While most political party constitutions have a 40% minimum quota for women’s representation in their formal structure, none has  made good on this commitment in the nearly two decades that Uganda has been a multiparty state. My study found that women’s representation averaged 30% and below. 
I also found that Uganda’s multiparty arrangement has tokenised women in the political system. Women’s presence in political parties is meant to depict a semblance of gender equality. However, there is limited commitment to ensuring that barriers against women’s effective political participation are addressed. This significantly “others” women, rather than granting them active participation.
For instance, in Uganda’s 2006 election – the first under the country’s new multiparty dispensation – the National Resistance Movement, the ruling party, politicised the quota system on the campaign trail. Its leaders emphasised that women owed the party gratitude for helping to increase their involvement in parliamentary politics. 
In my view this propagated women’s dependency on the regime and painted them as victims of patronage.
Inbuilt inequality
In political parties, unequal gender relations are visible in their structures and processes. The tasks and positions meant for men and women are different. There is a division of labour, with the position of party president, for instance, often the preserve of men, while women deputise them.
In the National Resistance Movement, the second vice-chairperson has always been a woman. The party’s overall structure, however, largely remains gendered and focused on men. In its central executive committee, for instance, there is only one woman out of nine members.  




      Read more:
      Burundi’s quota for women in politics has had mixed results, but that’s no reason to scrap it




Party structures also reinforce traditional belief systems when it comes to the acceptable behaviour of a politician. Women’s leagues or wings that are meant to advance women’s political participation and advocate for women’s issues within the party are often used for care or social issues. 
The Ugandan case exemplifies the secondary status of women in political parties. 
Across my survey, while women’s leagues were provided for in the party structures, their duties and rights were not elaborated on. In most cases, their activities were managed and approved by the party executive. They were mainly used for logistical support and to mobilise the women constituency during campaigns. And in cases where party leaders meet only quarterly or twice a year, it’s unlikely they would have the time to thoroughly interrogate, or even include, women’s issues on the agenda.

Horn of Africa droughts: how a network of groundwater bores could help ,https://theconversation.com/horn-of-africa-droughts-how-a-network-of-groundwater-bores-could-help-study-230216,3019785,"Climate finance, aquifer, World Environment Day, solutions, Climate solutions","
The Horn of Africa recently suffered its worst drought in almost half a century, and its sixth failed rainfall season in a row. 
Fifty million people were directly affected and 100 million more were indirectly affected. About 20 million people risked acute food insecurity and potential famine, 4.4 million required humanitarian aid, and refugees fleeing drought and floods numbered in the hundreds of thousands. 
To help solve these problems, the governments of Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, South Sudan and Uganda, and three United Nations agencies, launched the Groundwater Access Facility  on 7 May. It aims to develop a plan to extract millions of cubic kilometres of deep groundwater. 




      Read more:
      Is eastern Africa's drought the worst in recent history? And are worse yet to come?









I research sustainable development, poverty alleviation and ways to adapt to climate change. This new initiative will focus critical attention and resources on water scarcity in the region. Together with better drought forecasting, this can help the Horn of Africa build resilience against future droughts and promote sustainable development opportunities.
Based on my co-authored research on groundwater in the region, I propose that a strategic network of deep groundwater bores (boreholes) be considered at regional scale to support both acute humanitarian relief efforts and longer term drought resilience building.
The problem
Beyond the humanitarian crises, the recurring droughts in the Horn of Africa cause spikes in food prices, reduce gross domestic product across the region, and intensify insecurity and conflict risk. Recent prolonged droughts have been followed by flooding, which can displace entire communities. 
The world’s largest population of nomadic herders lives in the Horn of Africa. They make up half the population in some countries. The herders are increasingly chasing rains that never come, or come all at once. Smallholder farmers are also affected and crops fail. Over 40 million people in regional border areas have little or no water infrastructure.
Studies by institutions such as the British Geological Survey, United States Geological Survey  and  World Bank Group have confirmed voluminous resources across sub-Saharan Africa. Based on our review of this information, we believe a network of deep groundwater bores can work in the Horn of Africa.
Groundwater to the rescue
Groundwater supplies half of all drinking water and approximately one-third of irrigation and industry water in the world. Unlike surface water (rivers, streams and lakes) and shallower aquifers, deeper groundwater resources may present climate resilient, unpolluted and plentiful supplies of water in times of drought.




      Read more:
      Groundwater can prevent drought emergencies in the Horn of Africa. Here's how




In the Horn of Africa, studies confirm that deep groundwater is often available in drought hotspots. Recurrent drought hotspots are well-known. Droughts can be increasingly predicted and groundwater infrastructure prepared in advance. Where it is refilled from time to time, using groundwater can be sustainable.
Recent reinterpretations of old well data indicates that about 400,000 Olympic-size swimming pools of rechargeable fresh groundwater exist in Somalia. Nearby Tanzania has a deep aquifer, estimated to have enough water for two million people.
Groundwater can also support emergency drought relief operations as it can be up to 50 times cheaper to supply to communities than water delivered by trucks.

The network of deep bores could be a mixture of supply to communities with the water they need every day or for drought emergencies when other water supplies run out, dependent on factors such as resource sustainability and local preferences. 
The communities who are most affected by drought in the Horn of Africa, and their seasonal movements, are also well known. This means they can be more effectively supported by networked groundwater supplies.
Working together across borders
Drilling down to this water and extracting it is not easy. It requires detailed knowledge of the local hydrogeology, and specialised drilling and pumping equipment. So it makes sense for the five affected countries to share knowledge and resources.

The Groundwater Access Facility will bring countries together to collaborate on groundwater mapping and data sharing. It could also look at ways to use new and advanced renewable energy and water treatment technologies and how to secure climate finance to invest in the project.
It is vital that local communities be included in the planning, design, running and maintenance of the boreholes. Working with hydro-geologists and other experts, communities can help decide the best locations for the boreholes.
Deep borehole development should form part of managing water resources more holistically. For example, in places where flood follows drought, plans may be made to capture and store floodwater.
Deep boreholes could be connected to smallholder farming projects to support emergency food and feed production. The boreholes could also become assets around which to coordinate emergency drought relief efforts and future resilience building programmes.
Precedents for accessing deep groundwater exist globally and lessons on collaborative governance may be gained from existing regional initiatives on management of major rivers.
The way forward
Many questions remain. For example, how would deep boreholes affect the movement and decisions of nomadic herders or displaced communities? Could boreholes cause conflict in already fragile settings? Should fossil (non-renewable) aquifers be accessed? Will the borehole water need to be purified? How can overpumping and other problems be prevented?
Because drought knows no boundaries, Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, South Sudan and Uganda must work together to answer these questions and to create drought resilience and sustainable development opportunities across the whole region. The Groundwater Access Facility is a platform for them to plan how to 
manage groundwater in the region sustainably. A strategic network of deep groundwater bores may support such potentially transformative regional ambitions.

Clothed pig carcasses are revealing the secrets of mummification â South African study provides insights for forensic scientists,https://theconversation.com/clothed-pig-carcasses-are-revealing-the-secrets-of-mummification-south-african-study-provides-insights-for-forensic-scientists-229396,3019686,"Forensic science, Mongooses, Mummification, Pigs, Decomposition, Dead bodies, Corpses, criminal investigation","
It was the kind of task any competent seamstress has completed hundreds of times before: altering denim jeans and jerseys. But there was something different about this piece of work. Though our team of scientists were paying for it, we weren’t her ultimate customers – the clothes were to be worn by dead pigs. 
The pigs and their specially tailored outfits were central to research conducted by ourselves, Devin Finaughty and our colleagues from South Africa’s University of Cape Town (UCT), a group of forensic scientists known as taphonomists. We study the environmental forces that drive changes to a body after death. A key aspect is estimating time-since-death, the length of time between death and a body being recovered. Ascertaining this detail can help to identify the person and reconstruct the circumstances around their death.
Legal and ethical challenges prohibit taphonomic research using donated human remains in most countries. Currently, human taphonomic facilities only exist in  the US, the Netherlands, Australia and Canada. These facilities have been proposed in other countries, including the UK and India, but have not overcome legal and public resistance. 
These human facilities are not legal in South Africa, and as a result pigs are used. Pigs, specifically those weighing around 60kg, are useful for human decomposition studies because they have anatomical similarities to humans. They have been used in taphonomic research since the 1980s.





But it’s not just the human body that decomposes after death. Clothing degrades too and, to obtain forensically realistic information, clothing tailored to the body is required. That’s why a seamstress was so central to this study. Once the alterations were done, we dressed six pig carcasses and left them to decompose in two forensically significant Cape Town habitats, one in Delft at the South African Medical Research Council’s research facility and one in a secure area in the suburb of Rosebank. 
We found, overall, that winter-season clothing delayed decomposition. Summer-season clothing accelerated the process. Carcass weight loss was directly affected by the scavenging of the Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta), which accelerated the decomposition rate. And single carcasses within the same habitat decomposed faster than when two or more carcasses are dumped together.
These findings have helped deepen our understanding of how soft tissue desiccates (dries out or mummifies), which is central to improving the accuracy of time-since-death estimations and can assist in criminal investigations.
A unique experiment
This study, which was part of Dr Adams’ PhD, is the latest conducted by our research team, which has been collecting data since 2014. The team has years of local data; for instance, we were the first to show that mongoose scavenge from bodies.

      How scavengers can help forensic scientists identify human corpses




In this experiment we focused on mummification. This isn’t the process you might associate with ancient Egyptian practices. Cape Town summers are hot with dry winds; this can produce a rare natural phenomenon known as precocious mummification. This occurs when the body desiccates in less than 30 days through the gradual removal of moisture from tissues. It is usually the result of climatic extremes, such as in an arid desert, and hot, dry micro-environments, such as in a sealed house. 
The phenomenon was first documented in Cape Town only in 2019 by members of our team. Our new experiment sought to build on those findings by analysing the specific environmental driving forces of desiccation in Cape Town. Courts of law prefer quantifiable data with low levels of subjectivity, so this is critical for justice.   
Clothing was a key part of this experiment. That’s because most of the dead bodies found outdoors in the Cape Town area are dressed in seasonally appropriate clothing. 

The majority of these cases involve a single deceased person. We chose clothing for the pig carcasses based on a previous survey of the most common items found in actual local forensic cases.
Sensors gather rich data
An electrical engineer at UCT, Justin Pead, helped us design and develop sensors that were inserted into the pig bodies (one in the head, one in the neck and one in the lower body). These devices measure tissue resistivity at various depths within decomposing bodies, which is related to the drying out of the tissue.

The sensors were tested across two summer seasons and one winter. The data they collected illustrate the complex interplay between environmental conditions and mummification processes.
In the high heat of summer, the body rapidly desiccated, with tissues gradually losing moisture until reaching a state of mummification in under 30 days. In the coolness of winter, the bodies reached a stage of advanced decomposition and lost about 20kg of their initial weight but never lost any more weight and never reached the skeleton stage. The colder temperatures and higher humidity levels prevented them from drying out. Cape Town has rainy, stormy conditions in winter.

A global first
Measuring desiccation for estimating time-since-death opens new avenues for research. It has implications for several disciplines. Forensic anthropologists, forensic taphonomists, electrical engineers and statisticians all have a role to play. 
Our approach also offers the court system some more objective data.  
The integration of innovative methodologies and technologies, such as the use of sensors on custom-designed printed circuit boards inserted in decomposing tissue, is especially exciting. It promises to change forensic taphonomy practices and  enhance understanding of postmortem processes everywhere.

Top economists give budget modest rating and doubt inflation will fall as planned,https://theconversation.com/top-economists-give-budget-modest-rating-and-doubt-inflation-will-fall-as-planned-230670,3019427,"Reserve Bank of Australia, Inflation, RBA, Consumer price index (CPI), Commonwealth Rent Assistance, ESA-Conversation National Economic Poll, Federal budget 2024, future made in australia","
Asked to grade Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ third budget on his own criteria of delivering on “inflation in the near term and then growth in the medium term”, most of the 49 leading economists surveyed by the Economic Society of Australia and The Conversation have failed to give it top marks.
On a grading scale of A to F, 17 of the 49 economists – about one-third – give the budget an A or a B. Two have declined to offer a grade.
The result is a sharp comedown from Chalmers’ second budget in 2023. Two-thirds of the economists surveyed conferred an A or a B on that budget.
The economists chosen to take part in the post-budget Economic Society surveys are recognised by their peers as leaders in fields including macroeconomics, economic modelling, housing and budget policy.
Among them are a former head of the Department of Finance, a former Reserve Bank board member and former Treasury, International Monetary Fund and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development officials.
Thirteen of those surveyed – more than a quarter – give the budget a low mark of D or an E. None have given it the lowest possible mark of F.



Asked whether the budget was likely to achieve its aim of getting inflation back within the Reserve Bank’s 2-3% target band by the end of this year, and back to 2.75% by mid next year, 17 thought it would not. Only ten thought it would.
A greater number – 21 – were not sure.



In his budget speech, Chalmers predicted inflation would come back to the Reserve Bank’s target band sooner than the 2025 expected by the Reserve Bank itself, “perhaps even by the end of this year”.
The budget papers forecast an inflation rate of 2.75% by mid-2025, well within the target band and a half a percentage point lower than the bank’s forecast. 
The papers say two measures in the budget, not known to the Reserve Bank when it produced its forecasts in early May, explain why the budget forecast is half a percentage point lower.
They are an extra year of energy bill relief of $300 per household and $325 for eligible small businesses and a further 10% increase in the maximum rate of Commonwealth Rent Assistance.



If the lower budget forecast is correct, and if the Reserve Bank sticks to the letter of its agreement with the treasurer that requires it to aim for consumer price inflation between 2% and 3%, the bank is likely to cut interest rates late this year or early next year as inflation approaches its target zone.
But economists including Flavio Menezes from The University of Queensland say while the budget measures might “mechanically” suppress measured inflation, they are:

unlikely to alleviate underlying inflationary pressures and may even exacerbate them; for households not experiencing financial strain, lower energy bills could simply lead to increased spending in other areas.

Former Reserve Bank board member Warwick Mckibbin says the bank is likely to “see through” (ignore) the largely temporary mechanical price reductions and “raise interest rates to where they should be”.
Others surveyed, a minority, argue the economy is too weak for the extra spending in the budget to boost inflation through consumer spending. Former Finance Department Secretary Michael Keating says any stimulus is “likely to be swamped by the economic slowing well under way”.
Independent economist Saul Eslake said the subsidies for energy and rent would inject only $3 billion into the economy in 2024-25. This meant any boost they would give to underlying inflation would be hardly “material”.
Tax cuts matter more than energy rebates
More important for boosting the economy would be previously budgeted Stage 3 tax cuts. These are set to inject $23.3 billion per year from June, climbing to $107.2 billion over four years.
Eslake said the decision to reskew the tax cuts toward middle and lower earners had saved the government from the need to direct extra specific support to these people. Politically, the government could not have got away with doing nothing.
But Eslake was appalled to discover that the cost of the single biggest spending item in the budget, the untied grants to the states, had blown out even more than expected. The special top-up for Western Australia is now set to cost $53 billion over 11 years instead of the $8.9 billion over eight years expected in 2018.
How the national government could justify gifting $53 billion to the government of Australia’s richest state was beyond his comprehension.
Big issues unaddressed
A repeated theme among the economists was that the budget did very little to boost productivity or address persistent problems.
Several described it as an election budget, others a budget driven by polling.
Macquarie University’s Lisa Magnani said the lack of attention to home prices, the funding of public schools and the poor performance of Australian firms was concerning, given Chalmers’ claim it was a budget for “decades to come”.
Former Department of Foreign Affairs chief economist Jenny Gordon said the budget had failed to tackle the distortions in the housing market and the financial sustainability of needed services including health care, aged care and childcare. 

Independent economist Nicki Hutley said crunch time for tax reform was coming, given the large baked-in increases in spending on defence, health and disability insurance and Australia’s over-reliance on income tax and company tax. 
Warwick McKibbin said Australia’s main economic problems were its lack of productivity growth, the big changes needed to bring about the energy transition, the surge in artificial intelligence, the risk of much lower export prices and geopolitical uncertainty.
The government should have tried to build a bipartisan consensus about how to fix these.
Private investors were hanging back knowing that whatever the government did could be reversed at the next election.
Although many of those surveyed welcomed the Future Made in Australia Act, some criticised its approach of “picking winners” and “wasting precious resources” by putting money into activities such as the manufacture of solar panels, which could be done more cheaply elsewhere.
Bigger government
Former Industry Department chief economist Mark Cully said it was in some ways one of the most consequential budgets in years.
It locked in a clear shift towards higher spending and revenue, which, at around 26% of GDP, was higher than any other time Australia had been near full employment.
Future Made in Australia was the most marked intervention by a government in shaping the future direction of the economy for decades.

"A century ago, the women of Wales made an audacious appeal for world peace â this is their story",https://theconversation.com/a-century-ago-the-women-of-wales-made-an-audacious-appeal-for-world-peace-this-is-their-story-229540,3017761,"White House, United States, Women, World War I, Wales, Peacemaking, Peace, Welsh, League of Nations, Welsh culture, Welsh history, Calvin Coolidge, 1920s, Insights series","

February 11 1924, on board the RMS Cedric: Saw Statue of Liberty glowing in the sunlight. Bitterly cold wind, bright sunshine. At lunch, a press man came to me and said: ‘Mrs Griffiths, I am from the press.’ ‘I have nothing to say,’ I said. ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘we know your story of the Women of Wales movement, we want only your photos – will you come to the top deck when you have finished?’ So [we] trotted up to the top deck first class, where we found four burly photographers awaiting us.
March 12 1924, Los Angeles: A letter was handed to me as I left the station – an anonymous letter, telling us to get out of the United States.

One hundred years ago, Annie Hughes Griffiths travelled from her native Wales to the US, visiting everywhere from New York and Washington DC to San Francisco and Los Angeles. But while the diary of her trip describes some typical tourist must-sees – Niagara Falls, Grand Canyon, Golden Gate Bridge and Lincoln Memorial – this was no ordinary vacation, and Hughes Griffiths no ordinary tourist.

She was part of a delegation of four Welsh women tasked with delivering what the  South Wales Gazette described as a “monster petition” – one which reputedly would have stretched for seven miles if its pages of signatures had been placed end to end. The petition was an appeal for global peace, from the women of Wales to the women of America.
This whirlwind US visit was the culmination of a six-month campaign that had seen more than 400 local organisers go door-to-door collecting signatures in towns and villages throughout Wales. In all, they gathered 390,296 signatures – which would be an impressive achievement even today, when the internet and social media connect us instantly with people around the world. But this was 100 years ago, at a time when cars and landline telephones were still objects of curiosity.

Hughes Griffiths and her fellow peace missionaries (all of whom paid for the trip themselves) presented their petition to America’s leading women’s organisations and later met the US president, Calvin Coolidge, inside the White House. But while many welcomed these pioneering women from across the Atlantic, others – including the anonymous letter writer Hughes Griffiths describes in her diary – were deeply opposed to the idea of the US taking a lead role in international initiatives, even those aimed at preventing war.
Despite the publicity the petition achieved on both sides of the Atlantic at the time – and the creation of lasting institutional and personal networks between Welsh and American peace campaigners – the story of this extraordinary effort has long since faded from our collective memory. It does not appear in history books even in Wales, and nor is it taught in schools.

We are the editors of a new book, Yr Apêl-The Appeal, which tells this forgotten history, thanks to painstaking research by the book’s contributors who combed through the diaries and letters of those women (and some men) who were the driving force behind the peace petition, as well as newspaper accounts and public records from the 1920s.
There were differences between the many thousands of Welsh women who signed the petition: language, religion, political affiliations, and socio-economic circumstances. But these differences were unimportant in comparison to what united them: the dream of a world without war.
Planning the petition
The association of women with the cause of peace was nothing new. It had been the cornerstone of the pre-first world war international women’s peace movement that explicitly linked peace with the expansion of civic rights to women – especially, but not exclusively, the right to vote. The logic was that if women were able to play a larger role in public life and in political decisions, there might be more attention devoted to peaceful means of resolving disputes.
Some 40,000 soldiers from Wales had died in the first world war, while many of their 230,000 compatriots who also fought had returned with life-changing physical injuries and “shell shock” (post-traumatic stress disorder). The war’s devastating effects on Welsh families and communities instilled a widespread determination that such a conflict should never again be permitted.
For some, the answer lay in a personal commitment to pacifism. Others looked to political parties: the Labour party in Wales experienced a surge of support that nearly doubled the number of MPs it sent to Parliament between 1918 and 1922, including several anti-war activists.
At the same time, there was recognition of the pressing need for some kind of institutional means of resolving international disputes – where nations could be brought together to settle their differences by discussions held around a negotiating table, rather than battles in the trenches. The newly established League of Nations held out the hope of providing the necessary furniture for peace.

Created by the Treaty of Versailles that formally brought an end to the first world war, the League of Nations (1920-1946) was envisioned as a practical means of preventing future war. It was greeted with great enthusiasm in Wales, including by David, Gwendoline and Margaret Davies, three siblings with personal experience of the horrors of war – David as an officer, Gwendoline and Margaret as volunteer nurses in a French field hospital.
All believed in the league’s potential to transform global politics. And, thanks to the enormous wealth they had inherited from their industrialist grandfather, David Davies of Llandinam, they could provide practical support for efforts to realise that potential. In 1919, they sponsored the world’s first chair in International Politics at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth. Three years later, another donation by David Davies (the younger) secured the long-term future of the Welsh branch of the League of Nations Union – then Britain’s largest and most influential civil society organisation dedicated to peace during the interwar period.
But while this raised awareness and support for the aims of the league within Wales, its global mission needed the active participation of all nations of the world – or it would never advance beyond dreamy rhetoric to give real hope for a more peaceful future. And from the beginning, the governments of some nations were unwilling to join the league – including the most powerful nation of all, the United States.
Collecting signatures

In some instances, three and four visits had been made to the same houses before all the signatures were secured. With very few exceptions, the lady canvassers were very well received. (Local newspaper report, Maesteg – December 1923)

Gwilym Davies, a retired Baptist minister and honorary director of the Welsh League of Nations Union, was a visionary – a man not only committed to the cause of peace, but with a talent for creating novel and engaging ways of bringing the issue to the attention of the wider public.
In 1922, he had suggested that young people in Wales might compose a message of “peace and goodwill”, and use the new technology of radio to broadcast it to their youthful peers around the world. His suggestion was taken up and began an annual practice that continues to this day, now led by the Urdd Gobaith Cymru (Welsh League of Youth).
The following year, on March 7 1923, Davies wrote to Mary Ellis, a fellow peace activist and only the second woman to be appointed as an inspector of schools by the Department of Education for Wales. Davies’ letter contained this deceptively simple-sounding proposal:

Would it be possible for the Women of Wales to approach the Women of America, and tell them frankly of their concern for the future of civilisation?

By May 1923, Davies’ proposal had been formally adopted by the Welsh League of Nations Union, and an executive committee formed immediately. While the goal of achieving world peace could not have been more ambitious, their plan was pragmatic: they would call on women in the US to persuade their leaders to join the League of Nations.

Every woman in Wales over the age of 18 was to be approached, to have the aims of the appeal explained and to be given the opportunity to support it by adding their signature. As many supporters and advocates as possible would be enlisted to achieve this enormous task – in the many remote, rural areas of Wales as well as its towns and villages.
Yet just two paid organisers, Mary Ellen Pritchard and Ethel Elizabeth Poole, oversaw the entire project throughout the north and south of Wales respectively. Pritchard, widow of the former mayor of Pwllheli, regarded the work as “a calling from God”. Poole, the daughter of a soldier, had a more personal motivation to work for international peace: her brother had been killed in France in 1916 at the age of 26.
Public meetings were held to spread word of the campaign in advance of the door-to-door canvassing. Pritchard and Poole spoke at many of these events, along with Gwilym Davies and Ellis. While the impression given by both journalistic and personal accounts of these meetings suggests they engendered a great deal of enthusiasm, the following local newspaper report of a meeting in Holywell indicates there may have been some lingering animosity towards the campaigning women, as a result of the fight for women’s suffrage:

Mr H.T. Roberts said that at one time he had been much opposed to women’s suffrage, but now he saw how wrong he had been. Here was a question in which the women of Wales had more right to say anything than anyone else.

Each of the thousands of sheets of paper the organisers used to collect individual signatures was printed with the words of the appeal in Welsh or English, so women could read it for themselves before deciding whether to add their signatures – or have it read to them in the case of those who were illiterate. These words included the following plea:

We speak simply as the women of Wales – the daughters of a nation whose glory it has been to cherish no hatred towards any land or people, and whose desire is for the coming on Earth of the reign of fellowship and goodwill. We long for the day when the affairs of nations shall be subject no longer to the verdict of the sword. And we feel that the dawn of the Peace which shall endure would be hastened were it possible for America to take her place in the Council of the League of Nations.


The petition’s organisers sometimes walked for miles in the wind and rain to ensure no houses in their area were overlooked. The weather in November 1923, when many of these signatures were collected, was apparently very stormy, and some of the petition sheets show signs of having been wet, in addition to the ink stains and finger marks. As Annie Hughes Griffiths would later explain to her American audience:

There are forms smudged with ink because they were taken from house to house in the rain. There are forms which are not so clear as we should like them to be, but they were handled from door to door, and there are signature forms which the canvassers took out to lonely places, where the signatures were obtained after a walk of a dozen miles.

There is a touching story about two neighbours, both living in considerable poverty, who pooled their limited resources to buy a shared pen and pot of ink, so they would be ready when the petition came to their doors.

Many of the women who signed had lost loved ones in the first world war. The son of Julia Ann Heywood of Trearddur Bay, Anglesey, had been killed on the Western Front in 1916. The brother of Jennett Bragg of Porthcawl was among 570 men who drowned when the British battleship HMS Goliath sank in the Dardanelles in 1915. Both the sons of Lucy Dickenson of Aberyskir Court, Brecon, were killed within a few weeks of each other in 1918.
By the end of January 1924, the process of canvassing for support was finished: 390,296 signatures had been collected. The thousands of petition sheets carrying all these signatures were carefully placed in an oak chest designed specifically for the purpose. Two copies of the appeal text were written in beautiful calligraphy and placed in binders made of gilded Moroccan leather. One copy was to travel to the US to be presented with the petition sheets, while the other would remain in Wales.
Taking the petition to America
Planning and preparation for the US trip had begun even before the appeal was adopted – led by Mary Ellis, who spent months exchanging letters with leaders of the American women’s peace movement. In December 1923, she set off for New York City as the vanguard for the other members of the Welsh women’s delegation, who were to follow in February.

In New York, Ellis met some of the most famous women in America campaigning for social and political change: Harriet Burton Laidlaw, Ruth Morgan, Carrie Chapman Catt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Each had honed their advocacy skills during the long fight for women’s suffrage, which was (partially) won in 1920 by the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution. By 1924, they were directing their efforts to the cause of international peace.
Thanks to the correspondence that Ellis conducted with Gwilym Davies, her impressions of these leading American figures have been preserved. Of her meeting with Catt, she wrote:

It would have done you good to see the wonderful light on Mrs Catt’s face as I told her simply what our little message meant … She was absolutely thrilled with the story of our memorial [petition].

But it was Laidlaw, a formidable organiser with extensive contacts in the American women’s movement, who proved a particularly valuable contact for Ellis. She ensured that dozens of women’s organisations lent their support to the Welsh women’s appeal. It was also Laidlaw who arranged for the Welsh delegation to be received by the US president at the White House – Ellis would later describe Laidlaw as the “fairy godmother” of the appeal.
On February 2, the rest of the Welsh delegation boarded a train at London’s Euston station bound for Liverpool, with well-wishers crowding the platform and congratulatory telegrams arriving from the former prime minister David Lloyd George, among others.
Chosen to lead this delegation was Annie Hughes Griffiths (then typically referred to as Mrs Peter Hughes Griffiths), a charismatic figure and a gifted public speaker who was at ease communicating in both English and Welsh. The chair of the Welsh League of Nations Union and president of its women’s committee, Hughes Griffiths was already well-known in Wales for supporting many aspects of Welsh cultural life, including her work documenting traditional folk songs. She was also well connected in Welsh political circles, thanks in part to her first husband, Thomas Edward Ellis, who had been a Liberal member of parliament.

The youngest member of the delegation was university-educated Elined Prys, who had done extensive work with refugees in Romania on behalf of the Young Woman’s Christian Association (YWCA) after the war. Also part of this travelling group was Gladys Melhuish Thomas from London –while not part of the official delegation, she joined the trip as a travelling companion for her friend Hughes Griffiths.
Just before leaving for the US, Hughes Griffiths gave an interview to Welsh daily newspaper The Western Mail, describing the Welsh women’s appeal as being one of “great moral force when it is remembered that it is the result of a nation’s voluntary effort”. The petition, she said, represented a new chapter in a long tradition of peace-making history in Wales.
How the women were received

When we reached land, several leaders of American women’s organisations met us carrying bunches of daffodils, whose patches of bright yellow first caught our eyes among the throng on the landing stage. Our hostesses’ amazement was great when they saw Mrs Peter Hughes Griffiths also holding a bunch of daffodils, which had successfully traversed the Atlantic in the cold storage chamber!

After a week crossing the Atlantic, the RMS Cedric – once the world’s biggest ocean liner – docked in New York. Ellis had written to warn Hughes Griffiths and Prys that they would be the focus of attention when they arrived, and that they should expect to be photographed for the American newspapers – “so put on your prettiest and smile when you land!”. In the passages quoted above and below, Prys described the scene at the dock and the welcome that greeted them in a dispatch from America, published in the Western Mail:

The car which met us was ornamented with daffodils. From the moment we entered it, we were whirled away into such a succession of visits and receptions as only American hospitality knows how to shower on its guests.

The Welsh women’s delegation spent a week in New York, networking with American women peace campaigners and attending social events. Hughes Griffiths gave numerous press interviews and speeches – most notably on February 19 1924, when more than 400 women representing over 60 American women’s associations with a combined membership of more than 16 million gathered in the grand ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel in midtown Manhattan, to witness the opening of the wooden chest and the circulation of the petition sheets for the first time. In this speech, she paid tribute to the many ordinary Welsh women who had lent their names and their support to this unique appeal for peace:

There are signatures of women of 90 years of age and over – [including] one of a woman of 101 – who were very anxious that the memorial should not be sent to America without their names. Our young university women of 18 years old have signed, but there is also many a cross signifying the mark of approval of those women who in their youth were denied the blessing of education. And there are the signatures of the mothers who, in signing, remembered their boys who fell in the war and now sleep quietly in the blood-drenched fields of France – with each signature, many a tear.

The success of the Biltmore Hotel event exceeded all hopes and expectations – as Hughes Griffiths reflected in her diary entry. “It was a truly thrilling gathering and one which, in our wildest flights of imagination, we have never thought of on such a comprehensive scale.” The next day, Ellis wrote about it in a letter to Gwilym Davies:

Mrs G [Hughes Griffiths] made a great speech in every sense of the word … When she read the memorial, Miss Prys and I stood up. I felt absolutely pent up with emotion … The reception by the American women was incredible – they listened to every word and their faces were a study to see. The most wonderful thing is the absolute understanding of our own message and mission.


From New York, the delegation went to Washington DC where they were photographed on the steps of the White House and met with President Coolidge. Hughes Griffiths secured from the president a promise that the petition and its specially commissioned oak chest would be given over to the safekeeping of the Smithsonian Institution, America’s national museum, education and research complex. Here it would stay for almost a century, unknown to new generations of Welsh women and men across the Atlantic.
Having accomplished their mission of delivering the appeal to the women of America, the 1924 peace delegation went their separate ways: Ellis to visit American colleges, and Prys to reconnect with friends from her work with the YWCA and the Red Cross in Romania. Hughes Griffiths, accompanied by her friend Gladys Thomas, embarked on a two-month peace tour of the US by train, all the way to California and back – meeting women’s groups, peace campaigners and representatives of Welsh communities, and giving yet more speeches and interviews to the press about the Welsh women’s peace appeal.
It was towards the end of this pan-American tour that Hughes Griffiths was handed an anonymous letter telling her to “get out of the country”. Although she passes over this incident lightly in her diary entry for that day, the episode reveals the strength of American isolationist feeling at the time. While many enthusiastic American supporters of the League of Nations wanted to see the US play a lead role in future efforts to prevent global war, others blamed Europe for dragging their country into war. These feared that US membership of the league would only lead to more costly and deadly international entanglements.
The Welsh delegation and their appeal landed squarely in the middle of these tensions, and the American women who helped Ellis arrange their visit had complicated political waters to navigate. Harriet Laidlaw, for example, was quick to see the publicity value of a direct, women-to-women appeal for peace, yet took care to emphasise the event at the Biltmore Hotel as a general plea for international peace through sisterhood, while playing down the appeal’s association with the League of Nations.
The Welsh women’s voyage to America forged lasting bonds between the Welsh and American women’s peace movements, and inspired the creation of a new US peace organisation, the National Committee for the Cause and Cure of War, which became America’s most influential peace organisation of the 1920s. Carrie Chapman Catt, one of its founders, later described its work as “a way of returning the compliment” to the women of Wales for their efforts towards international peace.

But while many women on both sides of the Atlantic continued to believe in the League of Nations’ potential for peace, the political mood in the US was unfavourable. Progressive causes, including international efforts to promote peace, were increasingly being labelled “subversive” and viewed with suspicion, including by institutions of the US government such as the War Department and the Bureau of Investigation (which later became the FBI).
The US never did join the league, and by the late 1930s the threat to peace posed by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers meant few were sympathetic to the argument that the nations of the world could and would work together to prevent conflict. Although many of the ideas connected with the league were resurrected in the United Nations and associated post-1945 institutions, by then the Welsh women’s appeal had been forgotten by all except those most closely involved in it.
The petition’s rediscovery
One summer day in 2014, a search for examples of Welsh peace activism in the collections of the Welsh Centre for International Affairs (WCIA, formerly the headquarters of the Welsh League of Nations Union) turned up a discovery beyond anyone’s wildest imagination.
In the magnificent library of the Temple of Peace and Health in Cardiff, the WCIA’s then-director, Martin Pollard, withdrew a slender brown spine from between reports of statistical reports about the arms trade in the 1930s. Made of Moroccan leather and apparently never previously recorded as part of the library’s collection, the illuminated gold leaf inscription on the front cover identified it as: “The memorial from Wales signed by 390,296 women in Wales and Monmouthshire, to the women of the United States of America.”
Inside the leather binding was the text of the appeal, written in immaculate calligraphy and expressing the anguish, hopes and dreams of a generation of Welsh women who were uniting in a call for peace. Susie Ventris-Field, who followed Pollard as WCIA director, later recalled:

It was a breathtaking moment – spellbinding, perplexing. A Welsh peacebuilding movement of a scale beyond any in living memory. How could such a story be hidden to history? How was such a record ‘lost’ right here in plain sight? What of the signatures – did they still exist? If so, where? So many questions … how could we discover the story behind it?


Finding the text of the appeal was only the first step in a long and complex journey of rediscovery that remains ongoing. A cascade of crucial discoveries has kept this research moving forwards, including the realisation that an old photograph showing four women standing on the exterior steps of a building, with one of them holding what appears to be a large, opened book, was in fact the Welsh women’s delegation in Washington DC – the book was the gift copy of the morocco-bound appeal.
After years of collaboration under the guidance of Academi Heddwch Cymru (Wales’s peace institute) between grassroots organisations including Heddwch Nain Mam-gu (Our Grandmothers’ Peace) and national institutions such as the National Library of Wales, the petition is back in Wales. The petition sheets are being catalogued, scanned and uploaded by staff in the National Library of Wales with support from volunteers, and we are getting tantalising glimpses of the discoveries that await us when all the signatures are digitised and available to search online. 

Already, the thoroughness of the petition organisers and their determination to reach as many women as possible comes through very clearly. Organisers in Caerphilly, for example, even acquired signatures from women in the local isolation hospital.
Once the signatures are transcribed, it will be much easier to cross-reference individual names with the Welsh census and other public records, opening up new avenues of research into the lives of the 390,296 women who believed, in the words of the appeal, that “the future is big with hope if we, as the women of this generation, do our part”.
Inspiring us 100 years later
A century later, we are building up a more holistic picture of the women who played crucial roles in this story – in particular, how they regarded the cause of ending suffering in war as intrinsically linked to ending other forms of suffering, such as human trafficking, and the way so many of them continued to be involved in the search for international institutions and practices to create the right conditions for forging peace.
But perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements of the Welsh women’s peace petition was that it was able to bypass the formalities of governments and officials, and speak directly as a “nation’s voluntary effort” (to use Hughes Griffiths’ phrase). This was an attempt to create a more peaceful world that was based on one nation’s women reaching out to another’s. In taking this direct approach, it was the first peace-making effort of its kind.

Some might question the value of the Welsh women’s appeal, since the aim of persuading the US to join the League of Nations was never realised. But that, we believe, would be a short-sighted response. Rather, it should surely inspire us to reflect on what we can do to support peacemaking initiatives today.
While packing away the petition in a chest might have inadvertently succeeded in hiding this remarkable testament to peacemaking, the spirit that dared hope for a world without war was not suppressed in Wales. From the peace pilgrimages of the late 1920s to the march on Greenham Common in 1981, to 21st-century initiatives such as the founding of Academi Heddwch and Heddwch ar Waith (Peace Action Wales), the work continues. Retelling this story is part of that work.
A century ago, the appeal called on women “of this generation … to aid in the effort to hand down to the generations which come after us the proud heritage of a warless world”.
That responsibility is now ours.
Jennifer Mathers and Mererid Hopwood will discuss their new book, Yr Apêl-The Appeal, and how the Welsh women’s peace petition can inspire the peacemakers of today at the Hay Festival on Thursday, May 30 2024.

Ganrif yn Ã´l aeth menywod Cymru ati i apelioân daer am heddwch byd ,https://theconversation.com/ganrif-yn-ol-aeth-menywod-cymru-ati-i-apelion-daer-am-heddwch-byd-dyma-eu-stori-230569,3017760,,"

Chwefror 11 1924, ar fwrdd yr RMS Cedric: Saw Statue of Liberty glowing in the sunlight. Bitterly cold wind, bright sunshine. At lunch, a press man came to me and said: ‘Mrs Griffiths, I am from the press.’ ‘I have nothing to say,’ I said. ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘we know your story of the Women of Wales movement, we want only your photos – will you come to the top deck when you have finished?’ So [we] trotted up to the top deck first class, where we found four burly photographers awaiting us.
Mawrth 12 1924, Los Angeles: A letter was handed to me as I left the station – an anonymous letter, telling us to get out of the United States.

Gan mlynedd yn ôl, teithiodd Annie Hughes Griffiths o Gymru i’r Unol Daleithiau gan ymweld â golygfeydd ysblennydd o Efrog Newydd i Washington DC, ac o San Francisco i Los Angeles. Ond er bod dyddiadur ei thaith yn disgrifio rhai atyniadau y byddai rhywun yn disgwyl i’r teithiwr talog ymweld â nhw – Rhaeadrau Niagara, y Grand Canyon, Pont y Glwyd Aur (neu’r Golden Gate Bridge) a Chofeb Lincoln – nid gwyliau cyffredin oedd y siwrnai hon, ac nid teithwraig gyfffredin oedd Annie Hughes Griffiths.

Roedd hi’n rhan o ddirprwyaeth o bedair Cymraes oedd â’r nod o gludo’r hyn a ddisgrifiodd y South Wales Gazette fel “bwystfil o ddeiseb” (“monster petition”) un a fyddai’n ymestyn dros saith milltir pe bai’r llofnodion wedi eu gosod ochr yn ochr. Apêl oddi wrth fenywod Cymru at fenywod America am heddwch byd-eang oedd y ddeiseb hon.
Roedd y siwrnai i’r UDA yn uchafbwynt ymgyrch chwe mis o hyd a oedd wedi gweld mwy na 400 o drefnwyr lleol yn mynd o ddrws i ddrws yn casglu llofnodion mewn trefi a phentrefi ledled Cymru. Rhyngddynt casglwyd 390,296 llofnod – camp a fyddai’n drawiadol hyd yn oed heddiw, mewn oes lle mae’r rhyngrwyd a’r cyfryngau cymdeithasol yn gallu ein cysylltu ni ar amrantiad â phobl o bob cwr o’r byd. Ond digwyddodd hyn gan mlynedd yn ôl, mewn oes lle’r oedd car a llinell ffôn eto’n destun rhyfeddod.

      A century ago, the women of Wales made an audacious appeal for world peace – this is their story




Cyflwynodd Hughes Griffiths a’i chyd-genhadon heddwch (â phawb wedi talu drostyn nhw eu hunain am y daith dros y dŵr) eu deiseb i brif sefydliadau menywod America, ac yn ddiweddarach i arlywydd yr Unol Daleithiau, Calvin Coolidge, yn y Tŷ Gwyn. Ond er bod llawer yn croesawu’r menywod arloesol hyn o ochr draw Môr yr Iwerydd, roedd eraill – gan gynnwys y llythyrwr dienw y mae Hughes Griffiths yn ei ddisgrifio yn ei dyddiadur – yn gwrthwynebu’n chwyrn y syniad bod yr Unol Daleithiau yn cymryd rhan mewn mentrau rhyngwladol, hyd yn oed os oedd y fenter honno’n ceisio atal rhyfel.
Er gwaethaf y sylw a ddenodd y ddeiseb yn ei dydd ar naill ochr i’r cefnfor – a chreu rhwydweithiau sefydliadol a phersonol hirhoedlog rhwng ymgyrchwyr heddwch Cymru ac America – pylodd hanes yr ymdrech anghyffredin hon o’n cof-ar-cyd. Hyd yn oed yng Nghymru, nid yw’n ymddangos yn y llyfrau hanes, ac nid yw chwaith yn cael ei ddysgu yn yr ysgolion.

Rydyn ni’n olygyddion llyfr newydd Yr Apêl-The Appeal, sef cyfrol sy’n adrodd yr hanes coll hwn diolch i ymchwil fanwl gan awduron y penodau a’u gwaith yn cribo drwy adroddiadau mewn papurau newydd a chofnodion cyhoeddus yr 1920au, a darllen drwy ddyddiaduron a llythyron y menywod hynny (a rhai dynion) a ddaeth â maen y ddeiseb i’r wal.
Roedd digon i wahanu’r miloedd o fenywod o Gymru a lofnododd y ddeiseb: iaith, crefydd, cysylltiadau gwleidyddol, ac amgylchiadau cymdeithasol ac economaidd. Ond roedd y gwahaniaethau hyn yn ddibwys o’u cymharu â’r hyn a oedd yn eu huno: breuddwyd am fyd di-ryfel.
Cynllunio’r ddeiseb
Nid oedd y cysylltiad rhwng menywod ac achos heddwch yn beth newydd. Y ddolen hon oedd conglfaen mudiad rhyngwladol heddwch y menywod yn y cyfnod cyn y rhyfel byd cyntaf. Mudiad oedd hwn a gysylltai heddwch â’r ymgais i ymestyn hawliau sifil i fenywod – yn enwedig, ond nid yn unig, yr hawl i bleidleisio. Y rhesymeg y tu ôl i hyn oedd: pe byddai menywod yn gallu chwarae mwy o ran yn y sffêr cyhoeddus ac yn y broses o wneud penderfyniadau gwleidyddol, efallai y byddai dulliau heddychlon o ddatrys anghydfod yn cael mwy o ystyriaeth.
Lladdwyd tua 40,000 o filwyr o Gymru yn y rhyfel byd cyntaf, a dychwelodd nifer o’r 230,000 o’u cyd-wladwyr o faes y gad gyda siel-sioc (PTSD, neu anhwylder straen wedi sioc) ac anafiadau a fyddai’n newid eu bywydau. Yn wyneb effeithiau trychinebus y rhyfel ar deuluoedd a chymunedau Cymru, lledodd penderfyniad di-droi’n-ôl na ddylai’r fath gyflafan gael ei ganiatáu fyth eto.
I rai, yr ateb oedd ymroi i heddychiaeth. Chwiliodd eraill am atebion mewn pleidiau gwleidyddol: profodd y blaid Lafur yng Nghymru gefnogaeth a ddyblodd fwy neu lai y nifer o ASau a anfonwyd i’r Senedd yn Llundain rhwng 1918 ac 1922, gan gynnwys sawl un a oedd yn ymgyrchwyr yn erbyn rhyfel.
Ar yr un pryd, roedd pobl yn cydnabod yr angen dirfawr am ryw fath o ddull sefydliadol a allai ddatrys anghydfod rhyngwladol. Roedd angen sefydliad a allai dynnu cenhedloedd ynghyd er mwyn setlo eu dadleuon o gylch bwrdd negodi yn hytrach nag yn y ffosydd a’r meysydd cad. Roedd sefydliad newydd, Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd, yn cynnig gobaith o’r fath – gobaith o allu rhoi dodrefn heddwch yn eu lle.

Wedi ei chreu gan Gytundeb Versailles a ddaeth â diwedd swyddogol i’r rhyfel byd cyntaf, y weledigaeth y tu ôl i Gynghrair y Cenhedloedd (1920-1946) oedd cynnig ffordd ymarferol o atal rhyfel yn y dyfodol. Derbyniodd groeso brwd yng Nghymru, gan gynnwys gan David, Gwendoline a Margaret Davies, brawd a dwy chwaer â phrofiad personol o erchyllterau rhyfel – David fel swyddog, Gwendoline a Margaret fel nyrsys gwirfoddol mewn ysbyty maes yn Ffrainc.
Credai’r tri ym mhotensial y gynghrair i drawsnewid gwleidyddiaeth fyd-eang. A, diolch i’r cyfoeth enfawr yr oedden nhw wedi ei etifeddu gan eu tad-cu, y diwydiannwr, David Davies, Llandinam, roedden nhw mewn sefyllfa i gynnig cymorth ymarferol i gefnogi’r ymdrechion i wireddu’r potensial hwnnw. Yn 1919, noddon nhw gadair gynta’r byd mewn Gwleidyddiaeth Ryngwladol yng Ngholeg Prifysgol Cymru, Aberystwyth. Dair blynedd wedi hynny, gyda rhodd gan David Davies (y mab) sicrhawyd dyfodol hir-dymor i gangen Cymru o Undeb Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd – o ran ei ymroddiad i heddwch, hwn oedd y corff mwyaf dylanwadol ymhlith cymdeithasau dinesig Prydain yn y cyfnod rhwng y rhyfeloedd
Ond tra bo’r gwaith hwn yn codi ymwybyddiaeth a chefnogaeth i amcanion y gynghrair yng Nghymru, roedd ar yr uchelgais fyd-eang angen ymroddiad gweithredol gan holl genhedloedd y byd – fel arall ni fyddai fyth yn datblygu y tu hwnt i rethreg a breuddwyd am weld dyfodol mwy heddychlon. Ac o’r cychwyn, roedd llywodraethau rhai cenhedloedd yn gyndyn o ymuno – gan gynnwys y genedl fwyaf pwerus ohonyn nhw i gyd, yr Unol Daleithiau.
Casglu’r llofnodion 

In some instances, three and four visits had been made to the same houses before all the signatures were secured. With very few exceptions, the lady canvassers were very well received. (Adroddiad papur newydd lleol, Maesteg – Rhagfyr 1923)

Roedd Gwilym Davies, a oedd wedi ymddeol o fod yn weinidog gyda’r Bedyddwyr ac a oedd yn gyfarwyddwr anrhydeddus Undeb Cymreig Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd, yn ŵr o weledigaeth – dyn a oedd nid yn unig wedi ymrwymo i achos heddwch, ond a oedd â dawn creu dulliau newydd a dengar o ddod â mater heddwch i sylw’r cyhoedd ehangach.
Yn 1922, awgrymodd y dylai pobl ifanc Cymru gyfansoddi neges “heddwch ac ewyllys da” a defnyddio technoleg newydd y radio i’w darlledu i’w cyfoedion ledled y byd. Cydiwyd yn ei awgrym a dyma ddechrau ar draddodiad sy’n parhau hyd heddiw, bellach o dan arweiniad Urdd Gobaith Cymru.
Y flwyddyn ganlynol, Mawrth 7 1923, ysgrifennodd Davies at Mary Ellis, cyd-ymgyrchydd dros heddwch a’r ail wraig erioed i gael ei phenodi’n arolygydd ysgolion gan Adran Addysg Cymru. Yn llythyr Davies roedd awgrym a ymddangosai’n dwyllodrus o syml:

Would it be possible for the Women of Wales to approach the Women of America, and tell them frankly of their concern for the future of civilisation?

Erbyn Mai 1923, roedd cynnig Davies wedi ei fabwysiadu’n ffurfiol gan Undeb Cymreig Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd, a lluniwyd pwyllgor gwaith ar unwaith. Ni allai’r amcan fod wedi bod yn un mwy uchelgeisiol: creu heddwch byd eang; eto i gyd, roedd eu cynllun yn un ymarferol: bydden nhw’n galw ar fenywod yr UD i berswadio eu harweinwyr i ymuno â Chynghrair y Cenhedloedd.

Bydden nhw’n cyrchu pob menyw yng Nghymru dros 18 oed, bydden nhw’n esbonio’r amcanion ac yna’n cynnig cyfle iddyn nhw gefnogi’r ddeiseb drwy dorri eu henwau arni. Bydden nhw’n ennill cefnogaeth cymaint o gefnogwyr a hyrwyddwyr â phosib er mwyn gallu cyflawni’r gorchwyl enfawr hwn – a chyrraedd y llawer ardal wledig a phellennig yn ogystal â’r trefi a’r pentrefi ledled Cymru.
Rhaid cofio mai dim ond dwy drefnyddes gyflogedig, sef Mary Ellen Pritchard ac Ethel Elizabeth Poole, a oruchwyliodd y prosiect cyfan, y naill yng ngogledd Cymru a’r llall yn y de. Gweddw cyn-faer Pwllheli oedd Pritchard, a ystyriai’r gwaith fel “galwad gan Dduw”. Roedd gan Poole, a oedd yn ferch i filwr, ysgogiad mwy personol i weithio dros heddwch rhyngwladol: lladdwyd ei brawd yn Ffrainc yn 1916 ac yntau’n ddim ond 26 mlwydd oed.
Cynhaliwyd cyfarfodydd cyhoeddus i ledaenu’r gair am yr ymgyrch cyn dechrau ar y canfasio o ddrws i ddrws. Siaradodd Pritchard a Poole mewn llawer o’r cyfarfodydd hyn, a hefyd Gwilym Davies ac Ellis. Yr argraff a geir mewn adroddiadau cyhoeddus a phersonol oedd bod llawer o frwdfrydedd yn y cyfarfodydd hyn, eto i gyd mae’r adroddiad papur newydd hwn o gyfarfod yn Nhreffynnon yn awgrymu bod peth drwgdeimlad yn dal i fod tuag at y syniad o fenywod yn ymgyrchu, a hynny’n dilyn y frwydr dros hawl menywod i bleidleisio:

Mr H.T. Roberts said that at one time he had been much opposed to women’s suffrage, but now he saw how wrong he had been. Here was a question in which the women of Wales had more right to say anything than anyone else.

Argraffwyd y miloedd o daflenni papur a ddefnyddiwyd gan y trefnyddion i gasglu’r llofnodion unigol gyda geiriau’r apêl yn Saesneg neu’n Gymraeg, fel bod menywod yn gallu ei darllen drostyn nhw eu hunain cyn penderfynu a oedden nhw am ychwanegu eu llofnodion arni – ac yn achos y menywod anllythrennog, darllenwyd y datganiad iddynt. Roedd y geiriau’n cynnwys yr alwad hon:

Nid amcanion gwleidyddol sydd wrth wraidd ein hymdrech. Siarad yr ydym fel Merched Cymru – plant i genedl na fynn gadw dig tuag at na gwlad na phobl, eithr sydd â’i dyhead am ddyfod dydd cydweithrediad ac ewyllys da. Hiraethwn am y bore pan na throir at y cleddyf am ddedfryd yn helyntion y cenhedloedd; a theimlwn y prysurir gwawr yr Heddwch a bery pe bai’n bosibl i’r America gymeryd ei lle yng Nghyngor Cynhrair y Cenhedloedd.


Byddai’n rhaid i drefnyddion y ddeiseb gerdded am filltiroedd, weithiau drwy’r gwynt a’r glaw, i sicrhau na fyddai unrhyw dŷ yn eu hardal yn cael ei esgeuluso. Roedd y tywydd ym mis Tachwedd 1923, adeg casglu llawer o’r llofnodion, yn arbennig o stormus yn ôl pob sôn, ac mae ôl glaw ar rai o’r taflenni, a hefyd staeniau inc ac olion bysedd. Fel y byddai Annie Hughes Griffiths yn esbonio’n nes ymlaen wrth ei chynulleidfa yn America:

There are forms smudged with ink because they were taken from house to house in the rain. There are forms which are not so clear as we should like them to be, but they were handled from door to door, and there are signature forms which the canvassers took out to lonely places, where the signatures were obtained after a walk of a dozen miles.

Mae un stori ddirdynnol am ddwy gymdoges, y ddwy yn byw mewn cryn dlodi, yn rhoi eu harian prin at ei gilydd i brynu ysgrifbin a photyn inc ar y cyd fel eu bod yn barod pan ddôi’r ddeiseb at eu drws.

Roedd llawer o’r menywod a’i llofnododd wedi colli anwyliaid yn y rhyfel byd cyntaf. Lladdwyd mab Julia Ann Heywood, Sir Fôn, ar y Ffrynt Gorllewinol yn 1916. Roedd brawd Jennett Bragg, Porthcawl, ymhlith y 570 a foddwyd pan suddwyd y llong ryfel Brydeinig HMS Goliath yn y Dardanelles yn 1915. Lladdwyd dau fab Lucy Dickenson, Aberyskir Court, Aberhonddu, o fewn ychydig wythnosau i’w gilydd yn 1918.
Erbyn diwedd Ionawr 1924 roedd y cyfnod canfasio am gefnogaeth wedi dod i ben ac roedd 390,290 o lofnodion wedi eu casglu. Rhoddwyd y miloedd o daflenni â’r llofnodion arnynt yn ofalus mewn cist dderw a luniwyd at y swydd. Rhoddwyd dau gopi o destun yr apêl mewn caligraffeg oreuraid, gain rhwng cloriau o ledr Moroco. Byddai un copi’n mynd i’r Unol Daleithiau ynghyd â thaflenni’r ddeiseb. Byddai’r copi arall yn aros yng Nghymru.
Cludo’r ddeiseb i America
Roedd y cynllunio a’r paratoi ar gyfer y daith i’r UD wedi cychwyn hyd yn oed cyn i’r apêl gael ei mabwysiadu a hynny o dan arweiniad Mary Ellis, a dreuliodd fisoedd yn cyfnewid llythyron ag arweinwyr mudiad heddwch menywod America. Yn Rhagfyr 1923, aeth i Efrog Newydd i fraenaru’r tir ar gyfer aelodau eraill y ddirprwyaeth o Gymru a fyddai’n ei dilyn hi ym mis Chwefror.

Yn Efrog Newydd, cyfarfu Ellis â rhai o fenywod enwocaf ymgyrchoedd y menywod o blaid newid cymdeithasol ac economaidd: Harriet Burton Laidlaw, Ruth Morgan, Carrie Chapman Catt ac Eleanor Roosevelt. Roedd pob un ohonyn nhw wedi hogi ei sgiliau eiriolaeth yn ystod y frwydr hir am etholfraint y menwyod, a enillwyd (yn rhannol) yn 1920 pan gafwyd cadarnhad o’r 19eg Diwygiad i Gyfansoddiad yr UD. Erbyn 1924, roedden nhw’n sianelu eu hymdrechion o blaid heddwch rhyngwladol.
Diolch i’r ohebiaeth rhwng Ellis a Gwilym Davies, mae eu hargraffiadau hi o’r cymeriadau blaenllaw hyn yn hanes America ar gof a chadw. Wedi cyfarfod â Catt, dywedodd:

It would have done you good to see the wonderful light on Mrs Catt’s face as I told her simply what our little message meant … She was absolutely thrilled with the story of our memorial.

Ond Laidlaw, trefnyddes heb ei hail ac un â chysylltiadau pellgyrhaeddol o fewn mudiad menywod America, a brofodd i fod y ddolen fwyaf gwerthfawr i Ellis. Sicrhaodd fod dwsinau o gymdeithasau a sefydliadau menywod yn rhoi eu cefnogaeth i apêl y menywod o Gymru. Laidlaw hefyd oedd yr un a drefnodd i’r ddirprwyaeth o Gymru gael derbyniad gan arlywydd yr UD yn y Tŷ Gwyn – byddai Ellis yn disgrifio Laidlaw maes o law fel “dewines deg” y ddeiseb (neu “fairy godmother” o ddefnyddio’r union eiriau).
Ar Chwefror 2, aeth gweddill y ddirprwyaeth o Gymru ar y trên yng ngorsaf Euston, Llundain, gan anelu at Lerpwl, gyda thyrfa wedi ymgasglu ar y platfform i ddymuno’n dda iddynt, a llond eu côl o delegramau yn cynnwys un gan y cyn brif weinidog, David Lloyd George.
Yr un a ddewiswyd i arwain y ddirprwyaeth oedd Annie Hughes Griffiths (a adwaenid yn ôl yr arfer bryd hynny fel Mrs Peter Hughes Griffiths); roedd hi’n gymeriad carismataidd, gyda dawn siarad cyhoeddus ac yn gallu cyfathrebu’n rhwydd yn y Gymraeg a’r Saesneg. Yn gadeirydd Undeb Cymreig Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd a llywydd pwyllgor menywod yr undeb, roedd Hughes Griffiths eisoes yn adnabyddus yng Nghymru fel un a gefnogai sawl agwedd ar fywyd diwylliannol Cymru, gan gynnwys ei gwaith yn cofnodi alawon gwerin. Roedd hefyd ganddi gysylltiadau da yng nghylchoedd gwleidyddol Cymru, diolch yn rhannol i’w gŵr cyntaf, Thomas Edward Ellis, a fu’n aelod seneddol dros y blaid Ryddfrydol.

Aelod ieuengaf y ddirprwyaeth oedd Elined Prys a oedd wedi derbyn addysg prifysgol ac a oedd wedi gwneud gwaith helaeth gyda ffoaduriaid yn Rwmania ar ran Cymdeithas Gristnogol y Menywod Ifanc (YWCA) yn y cyfnod wedi’r rhyfel. Cydymaith arall oedd Gladys Melhuish Thomas o Lundain – ac er nad oedd hi’n rhan swyddogol o’r ddirprwyaeth, ymunodd â’r daith yn gwmni i’w chyfeilles, Hughes Griffiths.
Yn union cyn gadael am yr UD, rhoddodd Hughes Griffiths gyfweliad i bapur dyddiol y Western Mail gan ddisgrifio apêl menywod Cymru fel un ac iddi “great moral force when it is remembered that it is the result of a nation’s voluntary effort”. Roedd y ddeiseb, meddai, yn agor pennod newydd yn hanes hir y Cymry o weithio dros heddwch
Pa fath o groeso a gafodd y menywod

When we reached land, several leaders of American women’s organisations met us carrying bunches of daffodils, whose patches of bright yellow first caught our eyes among the throng on the landing stage. Our hostesses’ amazement was great when they saw Mrs Peter Hughes Griffiths also holding a bunch of daffodils, which had successfully traversed the Atlantic in the cold storage chamber!

Ar ôl wythnos o groesi’r Iwerydd, wele’r RMS Cedric – a fu unwaith y llong fwyaf o blith llongau mawrion y byd – yn bwrw angor yn Efrog Newydd. Roedd Ellis wedi ysgrifennu i rybuddio Hughes Griffiths a Prys y byddent yn ganolbwynt sylw wrth iddynt gyrraedd, ac y dylent ymbaratoi at gael tynnu eu llun gan ffotograffwyr y wasg Americanaidd, ei chyngor oedd: “so put on your prettiest and smile when you land!”. Yn y darnau a ddyfynnir uchod ac isod, mae Prys yn disgrifio’r olygfa ar y cei a’r croeso a oedd yn disgwyl amdanynt, mewn gohebiaeth a gyhoeddwyd mewn adroddiad yn y Western Mail:

The car which met us was ornamented with daffodils. From the moment we entered it, we were whirled away into such a succession of visits and receptions as only American hospitality knows how to shower on its guests.

Treuliodd dirpwyaeth menywod Cymru wythnos yn Efrog Newydd gan rwydweithio ag ymgyrchwyr heddwch o blith menywod America a mynd i wahanol ddigwyddiadau cymdeithasol. Rhoddodd Hughes Griffiths nifer o gyfweliadau i’r wasg ac anerchiadau – yn fwyaf nodedig Chwefror 19 1924, pan ymgasglodd mwy na 400 o fenywod yn cynrychioli mwy na 60 o fudiadau menywod America a chanddynt aelodaeth o fwy nag 16 miliwn yn ystafell ddawns fawreddog y Biltmore Hotel yng nghanol ardal Manhattan, i dystio gweld agor y gist bren a rhannu taflenni’r ddeiseb am y tro cyntaf. Yn yr araith hon, talodd hi deyrnged i’r menywod cyffredin o Gymru a oedd wedi torri eu henwau ar y ddeiseb a chefnogi’r ymgais unigryw hon i greu byd o heddwch:

There are signatures of women of 90 years of age and over – [including] one of a woman of 101 – who were very anxious that the memorial should not be sent to America without their names. Our young university women of 18 years old have signed, but there is also many a cross signifying the mark of approval of those women who in their youth were denied the blessing of education. And there are the signatures of the mothers who, in signing, remembered their boys who fell in the war and now sleep quietly in the blood-drenched fields of France – with each signature, many a tear.

Aeth llwyddiant y digwyddiad yn y Biltmore Hotel ymhell y tu hwnt i bob gobaith a disgwyl – yng ngeiriau dyddiadur Hughes Griffiths: “It was a truly thrilling gathering and one which, in our wildest flights of imagination, we have never thought of on such a comprehensive scale.” Drannoeth, ysgrifennodd Ellis lythyr at Gwilym Davies yn sôn am yr hanes:

Mrs G [Hughes Griffiths] made a great speech in every sense of the word … When she read the memorial, Miss Prys and I stood up. I felt absolutely pent up with emotion … The reception by the American women was incredible – they listened to every word and their faces were a study to see. The most wonderful thing is the absolute understanding of our own message and mission.


O Efrog Newydd aeth y ddirprwyaeth i Washington DC lle tynnwyd eu llun ar risiau’r Tŷ Gwyn a chyfarfod â’r Arlywydd Coolidge. Cafodd Hughes Griffiths addewid gan yr arlywydd y byddai’r ddeiseb a’i chist dderw arbennig yn cael eu trosglwyddo i’w cadw’n ddiogel yn sefydliad y Smithsonian, safle amgueddfa, addysg ac ymchwil genedlaethol America. Byddai’n aros yma am ganrif namyn blwyddyn heb yn wybod i genedlaethau newydd o Gymry, yn fenywod a dynion, draw dros Fôr yr Iwerydd.
Wedi cwblhau eu nod o drosglwyddo’r apêl i fenywod America, gwahanodd aelodau dirprwyaeth heddwch 1924 ac aeth pawb ei ffordd ei hun: aeth Ellis i ymweld â rhai o golegau America, aeth Prys i gysylltu yn ôl â ffrindiau o’i chyfnod yn gweithio i’r YWCA a’r Groes Goch yn Rwmania. Aeth Hughes Griffiths, yng ngwmni ei chyfeilles, Gladys Thomas, ar daith heddwch ddeufis o hyd drwy’r UD ar drên bob cam i California ac yn ôl – gan gyfarfod â grwpiau menwyod, ymgyrchwyr heddwch a chynrychiolwyr cymdeithasau Cymraeg, a rhoi mwy eto o anerchiadau a chyfweliadau i’r wasg am hanes apêl heddwch menywod Cymru.
Tua diwedd y siwrnai hon drwy America, rhoddwyd llythyr dienw i Hughes Griffiths yn dweud wrthi am “adael y wlad”. Er nad yw hi’n gwneud môr a mynydd o hyn yng nghofnod y diwrnod hwnnw yn ei dyddiadur, mae’r digwyddiad yn datgelu tipyn am gryfder y syniad o blaid America ymynysol yn y cyfnod hwn. Tra bo llawer yn America yn cefnogi’n frwd y syniad o ymuno â Chynghrair y Cenhedloedd ac yn awyddus i weld yr UDA yn chwarae rhan flaenllaw yn ymdrechion y dyfodol i atal rhyfel byd-eang, roedd eraill yn beio Ewrop am lusgo eu gwlad i ryfel. Roedd y rhain yn ofni y byddai aelodaeth yr UD yn y gynghrair yn gwneud dim byd mwy nag arwain y wlad i ymryson rhyngwladol a fyddai’n gynyddol gostus a marwol.
Glaniodd y ddirprwyaeth o Gymru yng nghanol y tyndra hwn, ac roedd gan yr Americanesau a oedd wedi cynorthwyo Ellis i drefnu’r daith lawer o waith llywio’n ofalus drwy ddyfroedd cymhleth a gwleidyddol. Gwelodd Harriet Laidlaw, er enghraifft, werth cyhoeddusrwydd y syniad hwn o apêl heddwch a ddôi’n uniongyrchol o fenyw i fenyw, a bu’n ofalus iawn wrth ddisgrifio’r cyfarfod yn y Biltmore Hotel fel galwad gyffredinol am heddwch rhyngwladol drwy chwaeroliaeth, gan osgoi rhoi unrhyw bwyslais ar gysylltiad yr apêl â Chynghrair y Cenhedloedd.
Saernïodd taith menywod Cymru i America gysylltiadau hirhoedlog rhwng mudiadau heddwch menywod Cymru ac America, gan ysbrydoli creu mudiad heddwch newydd yn yr UD, sef y National Committee for the Cause and Cure of War. Hwn, yn ei dro, oedd mudiad heddwch mwyaf dylanwadol America’r 1920au. Dywedodd Carrie Chapman Catt, un o’i sefydlwyr, fod y datblygiad yn fodd o dalu’r gymwynas yn ôl, “a way of returning the compliment” i fenywod Cymru am eu hymdrechion tuag at heddwch rhyngwladol.

Ond tra bo llawer o fenwyod ar ddwy ochr Môr yr Iwerydd yn parhau i gredu ym mhotensial Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd i greu heddwch, roedd y cyd-destun gwleidyddol yn yr UD yn anffafriol. Roedd achosion blaengar, gan gynnwys ymdrechion rhyngwladol i hyrwyddo heddwch, yn cael eu gweld fwyfwy fel gwaith tanseiliwyr a chwyldroadwyr, ac fe’u hystyriwyd yn ddrwgdybus gan gyrff oddi mewn i lywodraeth yr UD fel yr Adran Ryfel a’r  Bureau of Investigation (sef yr FBI ymhen amser).
Nid ymaelododd yr UD â’r gynghrair, ac erbyn yr 1930au hwyr golygai’r bygythiad i heddwch o du’r Almaen Natsiaidd a phwerau eraill mai prin iawn oedd y rhai a oedd yn cydymdeimlo â’r ddadl y gallai ac y byddai cenhedloedd y byd yn gweithio gyda’i gilydd i atal gwrthdaro. Er bod llawer o’r syniadau a fu’n graidd i’r gynghrair wedi cael eu hatgyfodi yn y Cenhedloedd Unedig a chyrff a sefydliadau cysylltiedig wedi 1945, erbyn hynny roedd apêl menywod Cymru wedi mynd yn angof gan bawb ac eithrio’r rhai a fu’n ganolog i’r ymgyrch.
Ailddarganfod y ddeiseb
Un diwrnod o haf yn 2014, wrth chwilio drwy gasgliadau Canolfan Materion Rhyngwladol Cymru (CMRhC, sef cyn bencadlys Undeb Cymreig Cynghrair y Cenhedloedd) am enghreifftiau o weithio dros heddwch yng Nghymru, daethpwyd o hyd i rywbeth a oedd y tu hwnt i ddychymyg neb.
Yn llyfrgell hardd y Deml Heddwch ac Iechyd yng Nghaerdydd, tynnodd Martin Pollard, a oedd yn brif weithredwr CMRhC ar y pryd, feingefn tennau brown a lechai rhwng adroddiadau am ystadegau’r fasnach arfau yn y 1930au. O wneuthuriad lledr Moroco ac, yn ôl pob sôn, heb gael ei gofnodi fel rhan o gasgliad y llyfrgell, nodai’r geiriau a oedd wedi eu goreuro mewn aur ar y clawr blaen mai dyma ydoedd: “Yr Apêl oddiwrth ferched Cymru a Mynwy at Ferched Unol Daleithiau yr America … The memorial from Wales signed by 390,296 women in Wales and Monmouthshire, to the women of the United States of America.”
Y tu mewn i’r rhwymiad lledr roedd testun yr apêl, wedi ei ysgrifennu mewn caligraffeg berffaith lân yn mynegi pryder, gobaith a breuddwyd cenhedlaeth gyfan o fenywod o Gymru a oedd yn un yn eu galwad am heddwch. Yn ddiweddarach, fel hyn y cofiwyd yr eiliad gan Susie Ventris-Field, a olynodd Martin Pollard fel prif weithredwr CMRhC:

It was a breathtaking moment – spellbinding, perplexing. A Welsh peacebuilding movement of a scale beyond any in living memory. How could such a story be hidden to history? How was such a record ‘lost’ right here in plain sight? What of the signatures – did they still exist? If so, where? So many questions … how could we discover the story behind it?


Dod o hyd i destun yr apêl oedd y cam cyntaf ar daith yr ailddarganfod, taith sy’n parhau hyd heddiw. Mae sgwd o ddarganfyddiadau allweddol wedi cadw’r ymchwil i fynd rhagddi, gan gynnwys sylweddoli mai hen lun yn dangos pedair menyw ar risiau allanol adeilad, ag un ohonyn nhw’n dal yr hyn sy’n ymddangos fel llyfr mawr agored, oedd mewn gwirionedd llun y ddirprwyaeth o Gymru i Washington DC – a’r llyfr oedd copi cyfarch yr apêl yn ei rwymiad o ledr Moroco.
Wedi blynyddoedd o gydweithio o dan adain Academi Heddwch Cymru rhwng mudiadau llawr gwlad fel Heddwch Nain Mam-gu (Our Grandmothers’ Peace) a sefydliadau cenedlaethol fel Llyfrgell Genedlaethol Cymru, mae’r ddeiseb bellach yn ôl yng Nghymru. Mae’r taflenni wrthi’n cael eu catalogio, eu sganio a’u huwchlwytho gan staff y Llyfrgell Genedlaethol gyda chymorth gan wirfoddolwyr, ac rydyn ni eisoes yn cael cip ar rai o’r darganfyddiadau cyffrous sy’n disgwyl amdanon ni pan fydd yr holl lofnodion wedi eu digido ac ar gael ar-lein.

Eisoes mae dycnwch gwaith trylwyr y trefnwyr a natur benderfynol eu hymgais i gyrraedd cymaint o fenywod â phosib yn amlwg iawn. Roedd trefnwyr Caerffili, er enghraifft, wedi llwyddo i gael llofnodion hyd yn oed y menywod yn yr ysbyty neilltuo lleol.
Pan fydd y llofnodion wedi eu trawsgrifio, bydd hi’n llawer haws i groes-gyfeirio enwau unigol gyda’r cyfrifiad Cymraeg a chofnodion cyhoeddus eraill, gan agor sawl trywydd ymchwil newydd i fywydau’r 390,296 o fenwyod a gredai, yng ngeiriau’r apêl, fod y “dyfodol yn llawn gobaith os y gwnawn ni, ferched y genhedlaeth hon, ein rhan.”
Ysbrydoli heddiw, ganrif yn ddiweddarach
Ganrif yn ddiweddarach, rydyn ni’n dechrau gweld darlun eglurach o’r menywod a fu’n chwarae rhan greiddiol yn y stori hon – yn arbennig y modd yr oedden nhw’n gweld dolen dynn rhwng rhoi diwedd ar y dioddef sy’n dod yn sgil rhyfel a ffurfiau eraill ar ddioddefaint, fel marchnata mewn pobl, wrth i gymaint ohonyn nhw barhau i ymwneud â’r ymgais i weld sefydliadau rhyngwladol a dulliau gweithredu rhyngwladol yn dod i fod, pethau a allai feithrin yr amgylchiadau addas i greu heddwch.
Ond efallai mai un o lwyddiannau mawr deiseb heddwch menywod Cymru oedd ei bod wedi llwyddo i fynd heibio i ffurfioldeb llywodraeth a’i swyddogion a siarad yn uniongyrchol fel ‘ymgais wirfoddol cenedl’ (“nation’s voluntary effort” a defnyddio geiriau gwreiddiol Hughes Griffiths). Roedd hon yn ymgais i greu byd mwy heddychlon yn seiliedig ar fenywod un genedl yn ymestyn at fenywod cenedl arall. Yn y weithred uniongyrchol hon, gwelwyd ymgyrch heddwch gyntaf o’i bath.

Bydd rhai, efallai, yn cwestiynu gwerth apêl menywod Cymru, gan na wireddwyd y nod o berswadio’r UD i ymuno â Chynghrair y Cenhedloedd. Byddai hynny, fodd bynnag, yn ein barn ni yn ymateb cibddall. Yn hytrach, oni ddylai ein hysbrydoli ni i ystyried o’r newydd beth allwn ni ei wneud i gefnogi mentrau heddwch heddiw?
Os, wrth bacio’r ddeiseb mewn cist, y llwyddwyd yn anfwriadol i guddio’r testament rhyfeddol hwn o waith tangnefeddwyr, ni lwyddwyd i ddiffodd yng Nghymru’r fflam a fentrai oleuo’r gobaith o weld byd di-ryfel. O bererindodau heddwch yr 1920au hwyr i’r orymdaith i Gomin Greenham yn 1981, i fentrau yn yr 21ain ganrif fel sefydlu Academi Heddwch Cymru a Heddwch ar Waith, mae’r ymgyrch yn parhau. Mae dweud y stori hon o’r newydd yn rhan o’r gwaith hwnnw.
Ganrif yn ôl galwodd yr apêl ar i fenywod y genhedlaeth hon gynorthwyo yn yr ymdrech “i drosglwyddo i’r oesau a ddêl fyd di-ryfel yn dreftadaeth dragywydd”.
Ein cyfrifoldeb ninnau yw hynny nawr.
Bydd Jennifer Mathers a Mererid Hopwood yn trafod eu llyfr newydd, Yr Apêl-The Appeal, a sut y gall deiseb heddwch menywod Cymru ysbrydoli ymgyrchwyr heddwch heddiw yng Ngŵyl y Gelli, dydd Iau, Mai 30, 2024

Politics with Michelle Grattan: Andrew Bragg flags a coalition would use âcoercionâ of the states to get more new houses built,https://theconversation.com/politics-with-michelle-grattan-andrew-bragg-flags-a-coalition-would-use-coercion-of-the-states-to-get-more-new-houses-built-230675,3017589,"Mitigation, Liberal Party, Politics with Michelle Grattan, Housing supply, Budget 2024","
Housing remains one of Australia’s most pressing issues in both state and federal politics. The RBA keeping rates up and high mortgage repayments have left many Australians struggling. For those Australians who don’t own a home, it’s becoming increasingly hard to get into the housing market. 
The opposition has blamed the high levels of migration for why Australians feel so much housing pain. Peter Dutton has promised to reduce the permanent migration program (which brings in many skilled workers) as part of getting net overseas migration down. He says more than 100,000 homes could be freed up over five years. 
To discuss the oppositions plan, we’re joined by Shadow Assistant Minister for Home Ownership Senator Andrew Bragg. 
Andrew Bragg explains why the coalition sees migration as a critical issue when it comes to housing supply. 






Ultimately, you need to get the ratios back into whack. Now, just five years ago, you had a situation where you were bringing 260,000 people in and building over 200,000 houses. In the last year you’re having 600,000 people come in the country, but you’re only building 170,000 houses. So, you have to calibrate the ratios. 

When it comes to the actual building of new homes Bragg sees problems at state level, and he has a drastic solution.

The [federal] government’s policy has been to pay the states to build houses. That has not worked, and I think we need to go one step further and look at coercion. We can’t fund the local governments directly because there’s a constitutional issue, but we do need to look at how we can fund states or not fund states.
There are councils like Camden, Liverpool, Campbelltown. They all want to build houses, they want the density. But in some cases it takes them two years to get the water turned on. So while the state premier might be supporting development, the agencies are dragging the chain. So I think coercion is probably the most likely step. 

Finally, on Women in the Liberal party, Bragg lays out the direction he sees for the party: 

In terms of the selection of women, it is true that we have far too few in the House of Representatives, and that is something that the members ultimately need to fix. We’re not a command and control party. Now, the members will make their own judgements about who they want, and we need to encourage the members to consider these factors because we need to be a party that looks like modern Australia.

What the economic data told Rishi Sunak about the best date for a general election,https://theconversation.com/what-the-economic-data-told-rishi-sunak-about-the-best-date-for-a-general-election-230811,3017112,"Labour, UK economy, Conservatives, UK elections, UK GDP, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK inflation","
The announcement of July 4 for the UK general election took many by surprise. A key question is why it was called then when it did not have to be? The decision to call an election is always a gamble – there is perhaps no right time – and many factors feed into that call.
Legally, a general election had to be called in 2024. Behind the scenes, those in Number 10 will have been modelling when the vote should be held with the help of key economic indicators such as inflation and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as analysing the polls and speaking to focus groups. 
In the UK, the power to request a dissolution of parliament and call an election lies with the prime minister. The party in power uses a process known as “evidence-based diagnostics”, in which evidence is collected regarding the state of the UK and analysed alongside voter perceptions, in an attempt to identify the best time – for them – to call an election. 
This is complex, as it includes an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of rival parties, and of independent analyses published by organisations such as the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Increasingly, artificial intelligence is applied to sift through these vast amounts of data to spot patterns and make predictions.

Sign up for our new, weekly UK politics newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.

Recently, there has been some very good economic news highlighting that Britain is not as broken as politicians or some journalists might like us to believe. The UK inflation rate in April dropped to 2.3%, and GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.6% in the three months to March 2024.
The quest for economic stability
These two indicators played an important role in the decision to call a general election for July 4. It may be that, in terms of the economy, this is the best time for the Conservatives to take the fight to the Labour party, especially as Labour’s offer hinges around the promise of economic stability. 
The UK economy has experienced an early recovery from the technical recession it experienced in the second half of 2023. Household incomes have improved and this is bolstering consumer spending. Some of this reflects alterations that were made in the 2023 Autumn Statement, including the four percentage point reduction in National Insurance contributions paid by employees. 
In addition, financial markets now assume the Bank of England will begin cutting interest rates in August or September 2024, rather than in June. The anticipated timing of these cuts suggests the government had little to gain by waiting until the autumn to hold this election, because of the lag time between an interest rate cut and its impact.  
As such, the Conservative party can claim there is evidence the UK has already reached a time of economic stability that provides a platform for growth. Vote for us, they say, and we’ll build on this work.
Meanwhile, Labour has unveiled its pledge card with six key policies, including economic stability. These are the six initiatives that its analysis will have identified as being most attractive to voters and party members. 

Above all, Labour is arguing that now is the time for change. But to argue for change by itself is insufficient. Not all change is desirable and change also tends to disrupt, resulting in uncertainty and instability. 
My experience in evidence-based diagnostics leads me to believe that neither party has made best use of this process in identifying the key challenges the UK faces.
In many respects, it is good for countries to experience regular changes in their leadership. Diagnostics to identify the most important challenges to tackle should be central to this, but politics – that is, the effort to please voters – will dominate this and many more general elections. There is a tension in all countries between the interests and needs of citizens as identified by the evidence, compared with the desires of politicians to form the next government.
Voters will hope the next UK government can rise to the challenge and ensure both economic growth and national security. But they might feel more confident if UK political parties looked at policy identification and prioritisation through the same evidence-based lens that informed Rishi Sunak’s choice of July 4 for the election date.

"Louisiana set to reclassify abortion pills as controlled, dangerous substances â hereâs what that means",https://theconversation.com/louisiana-set-to-reclassify-abortion-pills-as-controlled-dangerous-substances-heres-what-that-means-230848,3017111,"Pregnancy, Abortion, Medical abortion, Abortion pills, Mifepristone, Abortion ban, Misoprostol, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Dobbs v Jackson Women's Health Organization","
Louisiana’s governor signed a bill on May 24, 2024, that reclassifies two abortion pills, mifepristone and misoprostol, as “controlled, dangerous substances.” Both pills have a long history of safe and effective use in medication abortions as well as for treatment of miscarriages and other conditions. The law makes it illegal to possess either of the pills without a prescription. Surgical and medication abortions are already banned in Louisiana, with few exceptions. 
The Conversation U.S. asked twin sisters Jamie Rowen, a legal scholar, and Tami Rowen, an obstetrician and gynecologist, to explain the new law’s implications – both for patients and providers.
What does Louisiana’s law mean for these abortion pills?
Mifepristone and misoprostol have long been classified as noncontrolled substances. Though a prescription is required in order to obtain them, there have been no criminal consequences for possessing these medications.
Louisiana’s new law reclassifies the pills as Schedule 4 drugs, which includes medications such as diazepam, more commonly known as valium, and tramadol, a commonly used opioid. 





In the U.S., prescription medications are divided into two categories: not controlled and controlled. These are based on the drug’s likelihood for mental and physical addiction. Louisiana just moved the two medications from not controlled to controlled.
Access to medication abortion already requires a prescription everywhere in the U.S. So people seeking abortions will still need to get a prescription to obtain the pills under Louisiana’s new law, just as before. 
What this law primarily does is make it a crime for people who are not seeking abortions to possess the pills. In Louisiana, it is against the law to provide a medical or surgical abortion absent the threat of a woman’s death or “substantial and irreversible bodily impairment.” Louisiana residents seeking medication abortion must get the pills from out of state. Under this new law, if someone without a valid prescription transports or stores mifepristone or misoprostol in Louisiana, they may face a penalty of between one and five years in prison and up to US$5,000 in fines. 
Controlled substances are further categorized by schedules. Under federal law, schedule designations are determined by a drug’s potential for abuse, its risk to public health and a few other factors.
Under Louisiana state law, there are five schedules that follow similar categorizations as federal law. A Schedule 4 classification means that the drug or other substance has a low potential for abuse, has a currently accepted medical use, and that abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence.
By classifying mifepristone and misoprostol as a controlled Schedule 4 drug, the legislature is asserting without evidence that there are dependence and abuse risks associated with taking the medication.

What science, if any, did the Legislature rely on?
This is the first time that a state has classified abortion medication as a controlled substance, but it is not an unprecedented classification of abortion medication as a Schedule 4 drug. 
Taiwan similarly classifies mifepristone this way.
The classification has no science behind it, however, as no studies suggest that the drug poses any risk of dependence or abuse. Mifepristone can be used for elective abortion, miscarriage management and even for labor induction, being more effective than traditional treatments with misoprostol alone.
In terms of safety, it is useful to compare the risks of mifepristone with another commonly used drug, Viagra. Though requiring a prescription, Viagra is not classified as a controlled substance. For mifepristone, there are rare reported cases of nonspecific fatal sepsis that could be related to women undergoing medical abortion in the U.S.
In contrast, Viagra was linked to 1,473 major adverse outcomes and 522 reported deaths in the U.S. during a 13-month period. The legislative history in Louisiana does not explain the science behind its classification scheme. 
It should be noted that there is no risk of dependence from either misoprostol or mifepristone. Misoprostol was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for its ability to lessen the symptoms of gastric ulcers but is widely used throughout obstetrics and gynecology for inducing labor and stopping postpartum hemorrhage. Side effects for those using misoprostol for ulcers or gynecological care are rare, particularly compared with other Schedule 4 drugs.

How could the new law affect access for nonabortion procedures?
According to the new law, the criminal penalties of up to five years in prison can be imposed regardless of whether the pills are designated for a person electing abortion or trying to complete a miscarriage. In addition, the law does not distinguish between the possession of misoprostol for the treatment of gastric ulcers or gynecological care.
By punishing people who are transporting or storing the medications for others, the law may create new barriers to access for a variety of people, even if it doesn’t criminalize pregnant people who consume the pills. 
What are the implications of the laws for other states?
The Supreme Court has interpreted the Constitution as allowing both the federal government and the states to regulate controlled substances. This means there can be variations in access to medications state to state. 
However, states typically follow federal scheduling guidelines and practices when making their own drug classifications. A well-known but rare exception to this common practice is cannabis, which many states have decriminalized or legalized contrary to federal law.
The immediate impacts will be on clinical studies on the two drugs in other states that have patients in Louisiana. Clinical trials with medications that are not controlled substances may be conducted in any state with little or no added state regulation. Clinical trials of controlled substances have additional regulatory requirements that can add costs and delay development.
The most likely long-term outcome is that other states may make similar legislative attempts to curb access to medication abortion, particularly in states that have unsuccessfully tried to stop access to medical abortion in other ways. 
This article was updated to reflect the bill was signed into law.

The surge in hydroelectric dams is driving massive biodiversity loss,https://theconversation.com/the-surge-in-hydroelectric-dams-is-driving-massive-biodiversity-loss-230895,3017017,"Fish, Rivers, Dams, Freshwater biology, Hydroelectric dam, Give me perspective","
Around the world, free-flowing natural rivers are being fragmented by dams, weirs and other barriers. It’s one of the biggest, yet least acknowledged, causes of biodiversity loss worldwide.
River fragmentation is a key reason migratory fish populations have declined by 81% since 1970, according to a new report by the Living Planet Index – a rate of wildlife loss six times that of animals that live on land or in the sea. 
These migratory fish need to move between different parts of rivers, estuaries and oceans at different stages in their lives. For instance salmon go from the sea to rivers or lakes to reproduce, while eels do the opposite. 
Some species migrate within large river systems, like the Clanwilliam sandfish which moves from lowland rivers into small headwaters of South Africa’s Cederberg Mountains to spawn. The dorado or Goliath catfish migrates more than 11,000 km from spawning habitats in the high Andes to nursery areas in the Amazon River mouth. 
An 80% decline in five decades:

That’s why it’s crucial to maintain as many free-flowing rivers as possible to allow species and nutrients to pass from upstream headwaters to the floodplains, deltas and estuaries downstream. Yet growing demand for renewable energy means there are at least 3,500 hydropower dams under different stages of development around the world, which, when complete, will nearly double the number of large dams on Earth. 
There are already over a million river barriers in Europe alone, and at least 16 million worldwide. Only around a third of the world’s longest rivers remain free flowing and less than a quarter flow uninterrupted into the open ocean. Once the new hydroelectric dams are all completed, 93% of the rivers on Earth are expected to be classified as moderately to severely fragmented.
Unintended consequences
With barriers now blocking their natural routes, no wonder there has been a catastrophic decrease in these migratory freshwater fish. According to the new report, the most alarming losses are in Latin America and the Caribbean, where populations are less than a tenth of what they were in 1970. 
This region has a high reliance on hydropower electricity and is threatened by increasing drought risk, but millions of people directly rely on these fish for food, livelihoods and traditional culture. The global thirst for renewable, “clean” electricity might therefore lead to unintended consequences.
While a single dam can cause serious disruptions, barriers act in tandem with other major stressors to cause even more devastating effects. Barriers increase water temperatures, compounding trends driven by climate warming. Warmer water holds less oxygen and puts fish under stress. And then those same barriers make it harder for fish to leave uninhabitable areas for cooler water upstream. 
Species which are adapted to fast-flowing, highly oxygenated cool water are overwhelmingly adversely affected and rapidly disappear from rivers impacted by barriers. Dams also trap sediments, which then alters habitats used by fish, as well as making it easier for non-native invasive species to establish. 
Down with dams
One river in the US is showing a possible way forward. In an unprecedented operation to rectify the ecological damage caused by damming, six dams along 400 miles of the Klamath River in Oregon are being removed. 
The Klamath River will run free, with sections having water flow after being dry for almost 100 years. Migratory salmon and steelhead trout will once again swim freely throughout the river basin, Indigenous communities will have access to traditional fisheries, and water quality will be restored. 
There are options short of full dam-removal. In many parts of the world, dam operations are also being modified in attempts to make the water flow more naturally. 
It may be possible to remediate some of the catastrophic impact river fragmentation has had on migratory fish species. However, this will depend on major and urgent engineering interventions, that effectively balance the need for water storage in reservoirs with human needs for freshwater biodiversity.

"What to watch for in Trump trialâs closing arguments, from a law school professor who teaches and studies them",https://theconversation.com/what-to-watch-for-in-trump-trials-closing-arguments-from-a-law-school-professor-who-teaches-and-studies-them-230747,3016810,"Donald Trump, Stormy Daniels, Michael Cohen, Election fraud, Alvin Bragg, Business fraud, Hush money, 2024 election","
After more than four weeks of often sordid testimony, accusations of lying and even a warning from Judge Juan M. Merchan to a witness to stop giving him the side-eye, lawyers in the hush-money case involving former President Donald Trump began to make their closing arguments on Tuesday May 28, 2024. 
In a jury trial, opening statements are meant to provide jurors a narrative framework to organize all the bits and pieces of evidence and testimony.  
Closing arguments are not meant to simply regurgitate the testimonies of all 22 witnesses or review the roughly 200 exhibits. For both prosecutors and defense attorneys, the closing arguments serve to tell the jury why the evidence is believable or not, why and how the facts are linked or not and, most importantly, why their decision to either acquit or convict is moral and just. 
Keep it simple
As a I teach law school students and practitioners, that moral message in closing arguments should link back to themes already woven into the trial. 





In this criminal case, one of four filed against Trump, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged the former president with
34 counts of falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels as part of an effort to influence voters’ knowledge about him before the 2016 presidential election. 
Trump entered a plea of not guilty and did not testify. 
For the prosecution, that moral message, as prosecutor Matthew Colangelo said earlier in the trial, is this: “It was election fraud, pure and simple.” 
For the defense, its closing argument should include an equally direct statement, much like what Trump defense attorney Todd Blanche has said: “President Trump is innocent. President Trump did not commit any crimes. The Manhattan district attorney’s office should never have brought this case.” 
There is at least one more purpose in closing arguments. It is to arm jurors with the arguments they need – either to shut down naysayers or gently persuade those in doubt – for when the real battle occurs, inside the jury room during deliberations. One way to do that is to find language from the instructions the judge will give to the jury, restate them in plain English and, in effect, make it look as if they are aligned with the judge and the law.
Less is more
A major goal of both prosecutors and defense attorneys is to untangle all of the evidence and testimony. They must cut through the distracting details and tell jurors, in effect, “Now you know why this witness was important” or “the document doesn’t lie – it shows you …” 
Prosecutors in this case must focus on why Trump was involved in the alleged conspiracy and what he knew about the alleged payments.

In my experience over 45 years, the wise path is to start the closing argument with the big picture of “What did we have to prove?” and then answering in a series of bullet points that explain how they proved their case beyond a reasonable doubt.
To this end, a limited and focused use of exhibits is best – not each and every bit of evidence. Less is more also regarding salacious details, the adultery and Trump’s own vulgar words. The jury just needs the reminder – they’ll recall the details.
With star witness Michael Cohen, an attorney and Trump’s former fixer, it may be different. The prosecution can’t hide from his lies and flaws, which Trump’s defense attorneys hammered home to the jury, so it’s up to the prosecution to embrace Cohen’s failures.  
Put simply, prosecutors must show that it doesn’t matter how big a liar Cohen has been in his past if, in this case, he has the receipts to back up his testimony. 
A reasonable doubt?
For defense attorneys, their goal is to reassert Trump’s innocence and argue that there is plenty of reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case.
That means pounding away at Cohen’s lack of credibility  and denying that any crime was committed. If anything, they may argue, these alleged crimes were no more than bookkeeping errors that Trump didn’t know about. 

But if the defense portrays everything as lies, as Trump has claimed,  they may paint themselves into a corner. If the jury believes, for example, that Stormy Daniels was telling the truth when she said she had sex with Trump, then Trump’s denials may work against his lawyer’s defense strategy.
The defense has one more daunting task: to strike the balance between attacking Cohen and explaining why the lawyer Trump hired is not corroborated by the reams of evidence – and Trump’s own words.
And the defense must decide what its goal is. Is it an outright acquittal, or a hung jury in which a unanimous decision was unable to be reached?
If it is the latter, expect to have a major push on Cohen’s failings and a lack of corroboration in the hope that at least one juror will stand firm and say, “That’s just not enough.”
But the last word in these final arguments goes to the prosecutors. Because they must prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt, they will give their closing argument last and know what they have to respond to.

With the UK heading for an election on July 4, it can feel like the result is pre-ordained. Labour has maintained a decisive poll lead for over a year and nothing Rishi Sunak does appears to shift the dial. 
But below the surface, much remains at stake in this six-week campaign. 
For a start, there is no possible result in this contest that couldn’t be described as monumental. Should Keir Starmer win, he would have pulled off the most astonishing electoral turnaround in living memory and return Labour to power for the first time in 14 years. Should Rishi Sunak win, he’d practically be defying gravity.
In Scotland, the SNP’s dominance could be about to be turned into total wipeout. In Wales, boundary changes have dramatically redrawn the electoral map. In Northern Ireland, the DUP is entering its first truly post-Brexit election in a state of crisis following the arrest of its now-former leader – just as Sinn Féin is surging. 





So, Labour’s huge poll lead is really just one part of the story. 
Here at The Conversation, a charity, we are dedicated to providing readers with trustworthy, evidence-based journalism. Over the coming weeks, we’ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we’ll fact check the claims being made.

Little evidence suggests Rishi Sunak will benefit from a football feelgood factor by holding a July election â it may even be an own goal,https://theconversation.com/little-evidence-suggests-rishi-sunak-will-benefit-from-a-football-feelgood-factor-by-holding-a-july-election-it-may-even-be-an-own-goal-230842,3016752,"Sport, Football, England, UK politics, Scotland, UEFA Euro tournament, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
Amid the shock of prime minister Rishi Sunak’s unexpected election announcement, it has not gone unnoticed that the July 4 date coincides with this summer’s European Championships in Germany. England and Scotland are competing in the tournament – though UK football fans will be relieved to know that the election won’t interfere too much with their viewing plans. July 4 is a rest day for the tournament, with no matches taking place. 
Is this timing purely coincidental or has prime minister Rishi Sunak hoping that a general air of national pride and jubilation around the football will help his chances? If it’s the latter, he may be sorely disappointed. 
International sport – especially where the national team is perceived to be successful – is thought to have wider effects on people beyond the game itself. This is often called sport’s “feelgood factor”.

This sense that the national mood might lift while the football is on is obviously appealing to someone in Sunak’s position. He had to call an election at some point and polls point to the public being heavily against him. He needs all the help he can get. And with the tournament running parallel to the election campaign for nearly three weeks, Sunak may also hope the “bread and circuses” of the Euros will provide a positive media backdrop.  
Nevertheless, the notion that sport brings a feelgood factor doesn’t actually stand up to much scrutiny. If Sunak is hoping to capitalise on the football, it’s a decision based on intuition more than evidence. 

Undoubtedly, governments never want to forgo an opportunity to wrap themselves in the flag and bask in the afterglow of a sporting triumph. But while the reflective glory may provide some short-term symbolic value and prestige to national governments, this tends to be overstated and mythologised. Harold Wilson’s 1966 general election victory is invariably discussed in the same breath as England’s World Cup victory in the same year – despite the election preceding the Wembley final by over three months. After Bobby Moore had lifted the Jules Rimet trophy, Wilson is reported to have quipped that, “England only win the World Cup when Labour are in power.”
There are, in theory, some political benefits from sports events. As moments of (relative) national unity, they can provide a rally-round-the-flag effect that is hard to match during peacetime. Yet, there is very little evidence that sporting events have a positive impact on the popularity of the government, much less provide direct electoral payoffs. What’s more, nearly all of this research is focused on the political effects of hosting a sporting event. If an effect can’t be found under these circumstances, it’s probably less likely that one would exist when a team is merely participating in a tournament.
And Wilson certainly feared the opposite when he stood for re-election and lost in 1970. While he publicly took a very different tone to 1966 that year, decrying the insinuation that his defeat was related to England’s loss to West Germany just four days before the election, he had, during the campaign feared “the government would suffer if the England footballers were defeated on the eve of polling day”. Amid a downbeat and despondent English electorate, Wilson’s Labour had lost 60 seats, having led in the polls just a few weeks before, handing a surprise victory to Edward Heath’s Conservatives. 
In his published diaries, Anthony Crosland, then local government minister and later foreign secretary, went further, blaming the defeat on “a mix of party complacency and the disgruntled Match of the Day millions”.

This legendary incident perhaps helps explain why the idea persists that a large sports events affect politics – and why Sunak hopes for a poll boost off the back of England successes. He may even secretly hope that if Scotland does well, it will boost support for the struggling Scottish National Party, which would come at Labour’s expense. 
However, Sunak had already misstepped on this front on day one of the campaign. Asking a group of Welsh voters (whose national team did not qualify for this summer’s championships): “So are you looking forward to all the football?”. This perhaps tells us all we need to know about the prime minister’s attempts to hitch his wagon to the vagaries of the national sport.

Does âwhiningâ really make you happier? A therapist gives his verdict,https://theconversation.com/does-whining-really-make-you-happier-a-therapist-gives-his-verdict-229961,3016751,"Psychology, Friendship, Psychotherapy, Give me perspective","
A problem shared is a problem halved. Research by Age UK shows that only 29% of adults share their worries, but of these 36% feel brighter as a result; 26% feel relief having confided in someone, and 8% feel that the problem recedes once shared.
Both the Sun and Daily Mail newspapers recently highlighted research by Southwest University in Chongqing, China, which asked a similar question in relation to teenagers: are they happier the more they “co-ruminate”.
The Sun interpreted this as: “Whining can actually make us happier – but only in a key setting”. And the Daily Mail as: “Ranting with your friends can actually make you happier, study finds”. But does misery really like company so much that we might enjoy being miserable? Let’s take a closer look at the study.
The researchers defined co-rumination as communication where people overthink and repeatedly discuss personal issues and negative emotions within a group for social support. They are conversations defined not only by the pessimistic personal topics discussed, but the group support in discussing such topics together. 





This process of collective rumination is key to psychotherapy, where it is not only the telling of negative experiences to another, but the experience of having your experiences validated, that has the potential to enable you to feel better – or, at least, less bad.
Co-rumination is more effective if the speaking involves what the Southwest University researchers call an “intimate, honest self-disclosure” to people within a relationship that is supportive and encouraging (co-reflection), rather than a set of talks within an empty, inauthentic relationship that merely “reinforces negative experiences, increasing the risk of depression and anxiety” (co-brooding).
Psychotherapy encourages prioritising a recognition of problems in order to address them (co-reflection), over worrying talk we often have with ourselves or others that only emphasise and keep us stuck in worries (co-brooding). Misery does indeed like company, but we can still choose what company our misery can keep.
‘Obsessive whining’
The new study significantly recognises positives in the bitching, griping, miserable company, termed by the researchers “obsessive whining”. Although this whining may focus on negative content, it creates a group identity that allows the participants to feel less alone.
We see this in schoolyards, workplaces and online platforms where the negativity and bitchiness allows us be part of a group. And belonging to a group often offsets the negativity carried in that group’s anger, frustrations and even hatred. 

From disenfranchised, misunderstood teens to radicalised group hatred, the company of moaning misery extends friendships and fellowship, albeit at the price of reinforcing the negativity. But this price of staying in a pessimistic contrary space is one many are happy to pay – though one might ask about the long-term cost of “friends like these”.
The research distinguished a different type of co-rumination called “supportive discussion”, which involves open or vulnerable sharing or self-disclosure. These discussions aim at a self-empowerment that is not at the expense of others. This group’s recognition of, and support for, self-humility is in marked contrast to the obsessive negativity projected onto other people we resent.
The whiners find pleasure in bonding over resentments and refusing the “other” people. The supporters find a happiness in sharing personal worries in order to accept. Online griping only conflates negativity. In contrast, the co-rumination of supportive discussions, like psychotherapy, gives negativity a space – but it contains and holds it.
The researchers recognise that in relationships, the groups themselves are the key. It is our life’s journey to learn that friendships may not always endure. As we grow older, hopefully our needs in a relationship and friendship develop and evolve. We can discard the negativity trap of being stuck in the company of misery and perpetual complaint. 
There are some relationships that only feed and perpetuate the negativity within us, and other relationships that help us address the negative things in our lives. The latter are richer and thus more enriching because our humanity is met, and not just our moaning. But it is challenging to own and share our own hurt or anger vulnerably with another person. It is so much easier to project our moaning anger and hurt outwards and belong to the angry group – or indeed mob.

Haiti: first Kenyan police arrive to help tackle gang violence â but the prospects for success are slim,https://theconversation.com/haiti-first-kenyan-police-arrive-to-help-tackle-gang-violence-but-the-prospects-for-success-are-slim-230741,3016750,"Caribbean, Military intervention, Haiti, Gang violence, Peacekeeping, UN peacekeeping, Haitian Revolution, French Caribbean, Haitians, Haitian politics, Give me perspective, Haiti gangs, Haiti armed gangs","
An advance team of Kenyan special forces police have arrived in the troubled Caribbean nation of Haiti. They are part of a larger UN-backed “support” mission tasked with establishing order, pushing back the advances of criminal gangs and allowing the freshly appointed interim government to function effectively.
In total, around 2,500 officers are expected to join the mission from a host of nations, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh, Benin and Chad. This multinational police force will do the heavy lifting on the ground. But the bulk of the money to see the mission through will come from the US.
It is a noble initiative aimed at rescuing what many regard a failed state. However, there is plenty of scepticism surrounding the efficacy of this mission, not least from many Kenyans and Haitians who are not particularly enthusiastic about it.

      How Haiti became a failed state









External intervention has become a recurring event in contemporary international society. It has been undertaken in several contexts under the guise of “humanitarianism” for the purpose of protecting lives, establishing order in a conflict-ridden society and giving a new lease of life to a state that is failing in its primary functions.
However, intervention in another country’s affairs is a double-edged sword. There exists an established body of literature that argues foreign military interventions have not always been helpful or advantageous for the country on whose behalf it is undertaken. In fact, in some situations, it can do more harm than good. 
There are two reasons for this. First, any form of intervention, military or otherwise, undermines a nation’s sovereignty. And second, if the core objective of the intervention is not fulfilled by the intervener, it may compound the anger of those on whose behalf it was undertaken.
Yet another foreign intervention
This Kenyan-led mission will not be the first to intervene in Haiti’s internal affairs. Haitians have experienced two other external military interventions in the last 30 years. But each intervention has done precious little.
In 1994, the US sent 20,000 troops to join a UN peacekeeping force in Haiti in an operation to return Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power after a coup. Then, after Aristide was again forced from power in 2004, troops from the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti served in the country until 2017.
As part of a nation that was borne out of a slave revolt in 1791, Haitians of all walks of life have always reviled external interventions in their country. However, that sentiment has hardened in recent years following horrifying experiences with external forces trying to be “do-gooders”.
In 2005, Brazilian troops conducted a “pacification” operation in Cité Soleil, the largest slum of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. The troops in question were responding to reports of a disturbance in the slum when they were confronted by irate residents. 
They responded with violence. According to witnesses, the troops murdered 63 people and wounded another 30. That grief is still raw in Haitian memory. 
This grief was compounded in 2010 when a contingent of UN peacekeepers accidentally released contaminated water from their camp into local waterways. A cholera outbreak followed, leading to the deaths of up to 30,000 people.
During that same period, a number of UN blue berets from Brazil and Nepal were found to have raped women and girls, or sexually exploited them in exchange for food or support. 
A report produced by the Associated Press in 2017 revealed that, despite repeated denials by the UN, 114 of its peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti over a ten-year period and were never punished for their sordid sexual violence.

Given the enormity of these abuses in the hands of those who were meant to keep them from harm’s way, many in the country feel that past external interventions made life worse. Little wonder some in the country consider any talk of outsiders addressing the plight of Haitians as patently hypocritical.

The reason why many outside of Haiti are hopeful that Kenyan intervention can succeed where others have failed is based on an unspoken racial assumption. Given the scandalous UN peacekeeping operations and tainted military US interventions in the past, it is assumed that the current mission will have a natural legitimacy, be less contentious and enjoy a bigger chance of success, if there is a racial similarity.
The racial aspect of “humanitarian intervention” has perhaps been best highlighted by former Kenyan foreign minister, Alfred Mutua. When asked in August 2023 about the reason behind possible Kenyan intervention in Haiti, he said: “Kenya stands with persons of African descent across the world.”
Putting aside the racial dimension, the chances of the latest mission’s success is far from assured. There are currently an estimated 200 gangs operating across Haiti, and membership of gangs runs into the tens of thousands. They have a stranglehold on the country’s infrastructure, and they have driven hundreds of thousands of people from Port-au-Prince. 
Haiti’s armed gangs are the country’s real power brokers, with partners in politics and the private sector. Making them give up their lucrative operations in this broken country by way of a token 2,500 foreign police officers will probably be asking too much.

"Depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder linked with ancient viral DNA in our genome ",https://theconversation.com/depression-schizophrenia-and-bipolar-disorder-linked-with-ancient-viral-dna-in-our-genome-new-research-230490,3016749,"DNA, Schizophrenia, Depression, Bipolar disorder, Retroviruses, Psychiatric disorders, Educate me","
Around 8% of human DNA is made up of genetic sequences acquired from ancient viruses. These sequences, known as human endogenous retroviruses (or Hervs), date back hundreds of thousands to millions of years – with some even predating the emergence of Homo sapiens. 
Our latest research suggests that some ancient viral DNA sequences in the human genome play a role in susceptibility to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.
Hervs represent the remnants of these infections with ancient retroviruses. Retroviruses are viruses that insert a copy of their genetic material into the DNA of the cells they infect. Retroviruses probably infected us on multiple occasions during our evolutionary past. When these infections occurred in sperm or egg cells that generated offspring, the genetic material from these retroviruses was passed on to subsequent generations, becoming a permanent part of our lineage. 
Initially, scientists considered Hervs to be “junk DNA” – parts of our genome with no discernible function. But as our understanding of the human genome has advanced, it’s become evident that this so-called junk DNA is responsible for more functions than originally hypothesised.





First, researchers found that Hervs can regulate the expression of other human genes. A genetic feature is said to be “expressed” if its DNA segment is used to produce RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. These RNA molecules can then serve as intermediaries leading to the production of specific proteins, or help to regulate other parts of the genome. 
Initial research suggested that Hervs regulate the expression of neighbouring genes with important biological functions. One example of this is a Herv that regulates the expression of a gene involved in modifying connections between brain cells. 
Hervs have also been found to produce RNAs and even proteins in blood and brain samples. These molecules have the potential to exert a wide range of functions, as they can travel across cellular compartments to execute different roles. 
Scientists have also found evidence suggesting certain human genes are derived from Hervs. This indicates there were instances during evolution where Hervs were co-opted for specialised biological functions. For example, the human genes syncytins 1 and 2, which are derived from Hervs, play pivotal roles in placental development.
HERVs in psychiatric disorders
Considering the abundance of Hervs in the genome and their potentially numerous functions, we wanted to better understand whether genetic susceptibility to certain psychiatric disorders was associated with differences in Herv expression.

In our study, we profiled Herv expression in nearly 800 autopsy brain samples. This helped us identify DNA variations that influenced Herv expression in the brain. 
We then cross-referenced this information with findings from large genetic studies which had compared genetic differences between tens of thousands of people – both with and without mental health conditions. These studies identified variations in DNA associated with different psychiatric conditions. 
We found that that the expression of four Hervs was linked with genetic susceptibility to major psychiatric disorders. The expression of two of these Hervs was associated with schizophrenia, one Herv with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and one with depression. These results suggest that Hervs may be playing a more important role in the brain than initially thought.

      Discovering how genetic 'dark matter' plays a role in mental illness is just the tip of the iceberg for human health




There are many genes involved in psychiatric disorders – and Hervs are only a part of this puzzle. Although the precise impact of these Hervs on brain cells and on a person’s susceptibility to certain psychiatric disorders requires further research, our study is the first to show that genetic susceptibility for a psychiatric disorder also acts through these ancient viral DNA sequences.  
It’s still too early to determine the practical applications of our findings – and whether they might be used to develop new treatments. But we’re optimistic about this line of research. By linking Herv expression in the brain with psychiatric disorders, our research recognises the importance of these mysterious sequences in the human genome, which have been ignored for years.

Discovering Degas: new exhibition in Glasgow reveals boldness and foresight of early British collectors,https://theconversation.com/discovering-degas-new-exhibition-in-glasgow-reveals-boldness-and-foresight-of-early-british-collectors-230760,3016748,"Painting, Sculpture, Ballet, Art collectors, Impressionism, Degas, Give me perspective","
In 1891, an exhibition titled A Small Collection of Works by Degas and Others opened in London, before travelling up to Glasgow. It was organised by the Scottish art dealer Alexander Reid, who had recently returned from Paris.
During the entire run of the exhibition, only one work by the French impressionist artist Edgar Degas was sold. Impressionism was still considered deeply problematic for most members of the British public, and some of the works on show were criticised for their “distressing ugliness”.
Today, by contrast, the public queues round the block to see the work of Degas and his contemporaries.

This year marks the 150th anniversary of the first impressionist exhibition, and the movement is being celebrated not only in France but major cities across the world – including Glasgow, where Discovering Degas, an exhibition celebrating the taste for Degas’ work in Britain, has just opened.





The venue is the recently refurbished Burrell Collection, which boasts no fewer than 22 works by the artist, all acquired by the Glasgow shipbuilder and art collector Sir William Burrell.
This is the first major show at the Burrell since the gallery was named Art Fund Museum of the Year in 2023. Visitors will be able to admire more than 50 works by Degas in the context of the wider British taste for this artist. 

Paintings, pastels and sculpture
The market for Degas’ art was established in England thanks to the French dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who fled to London in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian war. He rented a gallery in New Bond Street, where he initially showed the work of Claude Monet and Camille Pissarro – also exiles in the capital.
Degas saw the opportunity to establish a new clientèle for his art and was delighted when a retired military tailor, Henry Hill, bought no fewer than seven works. After his death, Hill’s collection was sold at Christie’s; one of the pictures, known today as L’Absinthe (Musée d’Orsay), was hissed at when it appeared on the podium.

Set in the Café de la Nouvelle-Athènes, a favourite meeting place for the mpressionists on rue Pigalle in Paris, the painting shows a woman slumped at a table; in front, a glass of absinthe. This highly addictive drink caused hallucinations and long-term health problems and was considered deeply inappropriate as a subject for art. Despite this, the painting was bought by Reid, who then sold it almost immediately to Glasgow businessman Arthur Kay.
This and many other paintings are included in Discovering Degas. A major theme of the show is the ballet, for Degas had a subscription to the Paris Opera and was permitted to sketch the dancers rehearsing or standing in the wings.
When painting an actual performance, he preferred to view the stage from an unusual or unexpected angle. He adopted the same approach in his paintings, pastels and drawings of racehorses, preferring to show the jockeys warming up before a race rather than the excitement of the finish.

Degas’ portraits, too, challenge tradition. Among the exhibition highlights are his portraits of the art critics Edmond Duranty and Diego Martelli. Duranty’s essay The New Painting (1876) highlighted Degas’s habit of situating his sitters in their environment and adopting a “bird’s eye view”. This is most obvious in the painting of Martelli, who has turned away from the chaotic pile of papers on his desk and is lost in thought. 
This particular work, on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland, was once in the collection of Elizabeth Workman, a champion yachtswoman whose husband, Robert Workman (like Burrell) was a wealthy ship owner. She began collecting the work of Degas before the artist’s death in 1917, after which a large number of pictures were released onto the market.
As the exhibition and accompanying catalogue explain, it was in the 1920s, following the disruption of the first world war, that a taste for Degas’ work was really established in Britain. In 1922 and 1923, the Leicester Galleries in London held two solo shows of Degas’ work, focusing in the later exhibition on the bronze sculptures that were produced retrospectively by the Hébrard foundry.
During his lifetime, Degas exhibited only one sculpture, the Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (Tate). In the main, he used this medium as a means of working out the complex movements of the dancers, racehorses or women washing that would reappear in his paintings.

Although the bronzes were popular with several collectors – among them Welsh sisters Gwendoline and Margaret Davies – Burrell showed no interest, despite his love of the sculptor Auguste Rodin. His taste was primarily for pastels, a medium at which Degas excelled and for which he is admired today.
What this exhibition reveals, then, is not only the innovative and experimental nature of the artist’s work, but the foresight and boldness of these early collectors, including Burrell, in investing in his work.

Gotland has been a popular holiday destination for decades, but recently Swedish commander-in-chief, Mikael Bydén, claimed that Russian president Vladmir Putin “has his eyes” on the island. Concern was further ramped up, showing Gotland was just one part of Russia’s ambitions in the Baltics, in the last few days when Russia published a document suggesting that it needed to reassess the maritime borders in the Gulf of Finland.
That draft decree by the Russian defence ministry, which has since been removed, proposed that Russia wanted to revise its borders with Finland and Kaliningrad (based on a resolution adopted by the Soviet Union’s council of ministers in 1985) and expand its territorial waters.
Gotland holds a strategically important location of being in the middle of the Baltic Sea (halfway between Sweden and Estonia) and only 300km from where Russia’s Baltic fleet is based.  Sweden joining Nato and giving it access to Gotland has significantly increased the alliance’s ability to deploy and sustain its forces in the Baltic Sea region, and this could make a decisive difference in the defence of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland and Poland. 
Because of its strategic importance, for most of the cold war Sweden maintained a large military presence on the island. But Gotland was demilitarised in 2005 in order to promote peace and cooperation in the Baltic region.  





This gesture of goodwill was immediately tested by the Russians as, not long after doing so, Russian men who did not fit the usual Gotland tourist profile, began regularly visiting the island. 
Then, on March 29 2013, two Tupolev Tu-22M3 nuclear bombers came within 24 miles of Gotland on dummy bombing runs. Sweden’s part-time air force had the weekend off on account of the Easter holiday, emphasising both the country’s military weakness and Gotland’s vulnerability to Russia.
After Russia invaded Crimea in 2014, Sweden took significant steps to protect itself, reintroducing 150 permanent troops on the island in 2016. By 2018, Sweden had expanded the number of permanently placed troops to 400, equipping them with CV90 armoured vehicles and Leopard 2 tanks. Air defence systems were also reactivated by 2021.

      Why Vladimir Putin seems stronger now than he was a year ago




Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 led to additional reinforcements, exercises, and investment in Gotland’s defence, totalling US$160 million (£125 million). In April 2023, Sweden held its biggest military exercise in 25 years alongside Polish and British troops on the island.
For Swedish commander-in-chief Bydén, the reasons for increasing its defences in Gotland are clear. Gotland is both a major strategic asset and potential liability, and therefore must be protected in order to prevent greater threats from Russia to Nato countries from the sea.  
The geographical distances in the Baltics are small, and if Russia seized Gotland in a crisis, it could dominate the Baltic Sea region. This would make it very difficult for the west to provide reinforcement to the Baltic states by sea or by air.  
It’s not only Sweden that is concerned. Lithuania borders both the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad (which itself has become increasingly militarised) and Belarus, it is concerned that it could be attacked, and would then be physically isolated from the rest of the Baltics.

In usual Moscow fashion, when the online document about changing Russian maritime borders was spotted in the west, the Kremlin denied that it had any plans to do so. But there was no explanation from Russian officials as to why the ministry proposal was removed from the government’s portal.  
As leaders of the Baltic countries sought clarification, Lithuania warned that this was, at the very least, another Russian intimidation tactic. Estonia’s prime minster, Kaja Kallas, went further, claiming that Russia is engaging in a “shadow war” with the west.
Shadow war in the Baltic
The Baltic Sea has already been an area of heightened tensions this year.  Russian ships have stoked hostilities due to their increasingly brazen and careless behaviour, breaching maritime rules and sailing old and uninsured oil tankers, which could potentially cause an environmental catastrophe.
Russian shadow tankers (which are ships that are used in countries that have been sanctioned) have been present in Sweden’s exclusive economic zone off the eastern coast of Gotland, and have loitered off Gotland’s east coast. Russia’s fleet consists of about 1,400 ships that are not officially part of Russia’s military. 
Many of these shadow tankers refuse pilotage, the practice of directing the movement of a ships by using visual or electronic observations, even when navigating Denmark’s narrow Great Belt. It appears they are engaging in forms of brinkmanship.
These provocations all take place just outside the 12 nautical mile limit (a country’s territorial waters), making it impossible for Sweden to do anything about it, as these commercial tankers are not part of Russia’s official navy. The Swedish navy has warned that Russia is likely to be using these oil tankers to engage in sabotage, reconnaissance and espionage.
Because of these developments, the Swedish prime minister informed citizens in March that they needed to be prepared for war.  
In the past, Gotland was a deterrent against Soviet expansion. But Russia today under Putin seems less easily deterred and more risk-acceptant. What’s not clear is if these provocations are part of a Russian shadow war to psychologically divide and terrorise the west, or if this is a prelude to an actual war, which would certainly begin if Russia attacked Gotland.
As Sweden is now a member of Nato, this means that all members must come to Sweden’s defence should it face an attack. On its own, Sweden has a world-class and modern submarine fleet and air force and a technologically advanced defence industrial base.  
Given Sweden’s military capabilities, it’s hard to predict if this is enough to deter conflict with Russia. For now, it seems, Russia is determined to create suspense around its intentions in the Baltics — a region that holds both Nato’s greatest assets and vulnerabilities.  As a result, the Baltic region has become a playground in Russia’s shadow war.

Why the Conservative MPs standing down at this election are a huge electoral threat to Rishi Sunak,https://theconversation.com/why-the-conservative-mps-standing-down-at-this-election-are-a-huge-electoral-threat-to-rishi-sunak-230381,3016414,"UK politics, Conservative Party, House of Commons, Theresa May, Dominic Raab, MPs, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
At the last count, 118 MPs have announced they will not contest July’s general election. The vast majority – more than 75 – are Conservatives (or former Conservatives who have been suspended from the party). 
They include veterans such as Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, former prime minister Theresa May, and former cabinet ministers Dominic Raab and Ben Wallace. Even some of the 2019 cohort, such as Dehenna Davison, intend to leave after just one term.
Of course some MPs step down at every election. Some decide to pursue other interests, some just want to step away from the national political scene. However, we do tend to see spikes in the numbers of MP stepping down ahead of general elections where a subsequent change of government is likely, particularly from the incumbent party. For example, in 1997 the highest proportion of MPs standing down were Conservative, whereas in 2010, Labour MPs represented the highest proportion of those quitting.

The number of MPs who have already announced they are stepping down ahead of the next general election is as high as in 2010. And the departure of so many Conservatives creates a significant electoral headache for Sunak, who is already facing an uphill struggle. Seats where the sitting MP steps down have a history of underperforming for their party at the subsequent general election, compared to seats where the MP has stayed in place.
So a party which is behind in the polls, and already likely to see widespread falls in its vote share, can expect to see even more substantial falls in seats where one of its MPs retires. For some of these seats in 2024, an MP stepping down could be the difference between the Conservatives winning or losing the seat. Esher and Walton, where Raab is leaving behind a seat with a very small majority (taking into account boundary changes), is just one of the areas of concern.
The vulnerability of these seats can come down to the fact that an MP has represented a constituency for a long time and has built up a personal vote among people who might otherwise be lukewarm on their party. Local voters may feel more attached to an MP who is a familiar face with a track record of delivering for the constituency. A new, unproven candidate may make them think twice in the polling booth.

Those who are cabinet ministers or other senior party figures, also bring to their constituency an element of kudos associated with their positions. At a time when a party is unpopular, voters are again less “sticky” if a replacement candidate is on offer rather than a former minister.
Can anything be done?
Tracking what might happen in 2024 is a little more complex because the boundary lines between constituencies are being redrawn, but these changes are unlikely to change the pattern in Sunak’s favour. With his party so far behind in the polls and with recent by-elections showing that even Conservative seats with very large majorities are at risk of being lost, any MP stepping down adds an extra layer of vulnerability.
Sunak may be able to take some steps to mitigate the loss of personal votes in seats where his MPs are standing down. My research has shown that choosing the right candidate to stand is key. They shouldn’t be someone who has already fought a general election somewhere else in the country. A track record of this kind implies that party HQ is keen to get the candidate into Westminster, regardless of whether they know the local area. Counterintuitively, the evidence suggests they also shouldn’t be someone who went to school locally – but we don’t really know why that is. 
Sunak should instead choose someone who has ties to the seat – such as by living there or working there. It should also ideally be someone who has fought and won other elections locally, such as former local councillors, who come with the added bonus of being used to campaigning in the local area and are well-versed on local issues.
With the election now rapidly approaching, and some Conservative candidates yet to be confirmed where the MP has stepped down, time is running out to choose the best candidates possible to try and offset this unwelcome extra vulnerability.

"Scrapping FA Cup replays has upset smaller clubs, but they could still win from being matched against the top sides",https://theconversation.com/scrapping-fa-cup-replays-has-upset-smaller-clubs-but-they-could-still-win-from-being-matched-against-the-top-sides-229875,3016413,"Sport, FA Cup, English football, Give me perspective","
Football fans delight in historic moments enjoyed by their club. Exeter City supporters for example, will have fond memories of the FA Cup third round match their team played on the wintry afternoon of January 8 2005. 
Jubilant scenes greeted the final whistle after the side fought valiantly to secure a 0-0 draw, which gave Exeter City two things worth celebrating. First, as a non-league side in the fifth tier of English football, they had gone toe to toe with Alex Ferguson’s hugely successful Manchester United at Old Trafford. And second, they secured themselves a lucrative replay to decide which team would progress to the fourth round. 
Manchester United won the replay 0-2 (and went on to reach the FA Cup final, which they lost to Arsenal). But the two matches earned Exeter City a significant windfall of £1 million (closer to £2 million in today’s money) from ticket sales. This eliminated the club’s debt and set them on course to be a sustainable fan-owned club for the next 20 years and counting. 
Exeter’s current chairman recently said of the Manchester United fixture: “We would have been in a very different place today had it not been for that game.”





The tradition of FA Cup replays has become something of a cultural institution, adding to English football’s vital role in local communities. The system, which means that for the first four rounds, matches ending in draws are replayed (rather than going to extra time and then penalties) has created cherished sporting moments of individual brilliance, big club upsets and memorable scorelines. 
But they also provide an opportunity for smaller clubs to earn a big payday as gate revenues and TV incomes are split evenly between the two competing teams. In the face of an increasingly risky financial environment for football at all levels, this can be a lifeline to clubs, as it was for Exeter City in 2005.
So the FA’s decision to eliminate cup replays from next season has caused some upset – mostly due to the possible knock-on effect for smaller clubs. The new rules seem designed to reduce the fixture congestion of the elite English clubs that play in European competitions. 
Seeming to favour wealthy clubs in this way will only add to the continuing debate about the commodification of football versus longstanding cultural traditions.
Meanwhile, the Football Supporters Association and campaign group Fair Game (both of whom I have worked with previously on football accounting and governance matters), have called for replays to be reinstated on the basis of heritage and tradition, as well as the economic value to smaller clubs. 
Clubs including Tranmere Rovers, Stevenage and and Grimsby Town have also condemned the changes, claiming it will cause large disadvantages for smaller clubs, and arguing that “the dreams of so many should not be denied by so few”.
However, the FA Cup has a history of change and evolution. 
Lessons from tennis
Before the 1990s, games which ended in a draw would be replayed as many times as necessary until a winner was found (the 1980 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Arsenal took four games until Arsenal finally triumphed 1-0). Replays in all rounds have since been limited to one (with the second match going to extra time and penalties if necessary), and replays of the final were scrapped in 1998.
But replays are also not the only way for clubs to make money in the competition. This year non-league Maidstone United enjoyed a £700,000 windfall after reaching the fifth round, and none of their games were replays. 

Instead, it may be that smaller clubs being drawn against a much bigger club is the most important element. After all, back in 2005, Exeter City made more money from their first game at Old Trafford (with a vastly bigger stadium capacity) than they did from the replay on home turf.
And if the crucial element is the chance for lower league sides to compete with the goliaths of English football, a compromise could be reached. Football finance expert Kieran Maguire has suggested a seeding system, similar to that used in tennis grand slams, whereby the top flight clubs can only be drawn against lower league unseeded teams in the early FA Cup rounds. 
The lower league team would then get to choose whether the fixture was played at home (with perhaps a better chance of winning) or away (for a more lucrative fixture).
This compromise would reduce the congestion of games at the elite end of the game. But it would still give lower league clubs the chance to earn badly needed revenues – which for many would count as a big win, whatever the actual result.

GB Newsâs first election â how the new channel could affect broadcast coverage of the campaigns,https://theconversation.com/gb-newss-first-election-how-the-new-channel-could-affect-broadcast-coverage-of-the-campaigns-229651,3016412,"UK media, Ofcom, GB News, UK election 2024","
The prime minister’s announcement of a snap summer election in the UK caught many people by surprise. But broadcasters and the media regulator have been preparing for some time. Ofcom faces the challenge of monitoring how broadcasters report the campaigns, and whether they are abiding by the UK’s due impartiality laws in doing so.
The broadcast news landscape has changed somewhat since the last general election. This is the first time the highly opinionated GB News will be covering the campaign. Its partisan approach includes prominently right-wing journalists and politicians as presenters. Still, the channel has maintained an Ofcom broadcast licence since its launch in 2021. 
Radio stations such as LBC News have been airing opinionated political programming over the last decade or so. But the arrival of new television news channels (namely GB News, and Talk TV until it became online only in May 2024) have pushed the boundaries of Ofcom’s rules on impartiality.

GB News has repeatedly been found guilty of breaking the broadcast code, most recently with a programme featuring Rishi Sunak answering questions from the public. The broadcaster said that it has begun a formal legal process to challenge recent Ofcom decisions.

      Ofcom has rules on broadcaster impartiality – so why is GB News getting away with breaking them?




Over the last decade, Ofcom has gradually relaxed the rules on reporting impartially. In 2017, the regulator gave broadcasters greater editorial freedom in allocating air time to political parties during elections. More recently, radio stations and television news channels have been allowed to produce more partisan programming, hosted by politicians.
Unlike newspapers, online and social media, broadcasters (television and radio) have to abide by “due impartiality” requirements during an election campaign. This does not mean they have to give equal time to all parties. Ofcom issues specific guidance about ensuring parties and independent candidates receive “due” coverage during the six week campaign based on past and present electoral support. 
The regulator has already threatened to sanction any channels who fall foul of their impartiality requirements during the campaign. 
Politician presenters
Ofcom has faced increasing pressure from audiences about allowing politicians to present prime time television or produce programming from a partisan perspective. It remains to be seen how far the regulator will let this go over the next six weeks of the campaign.
While Ofcom has made it clear politicians cannot anchor “news” programming, such as in news bulletins or when breaking news, they can present current affairs programming. 
The regulator has said senior party political officials can continue to present election programmes as long as they are not candidates in the election. This means that Nigel Farage – honorary president and co-founder of the Reform UK party – can present his prime time programme on GB News right up until election day. Farage has announced he will not run in the general election.
Yet Ofcom-commissioned research has revealed that audiences could not differentiate between news and current affairs. In effect, this means audiences may not know if so-called impartial news is delivered by professional journalists or partisan politicians.
Ofcom would say that both news and current affairs programming must include alternative perspectives. But the degree to which broadcasters have to challenge partisan perspectives remains open to considerable interpretation. Critics have pointed to GB News’ routine nightly programming, which features highly polemical opinions and partisan commentary with few counter-perspectives from its anchors.
How this could affect campaign coverage
The reach or influence of new channels such as GB News should not be overestimated. Many other broadcasters, including the BBC and ITV, attract far bigger audiences and remain trusted impartial information sources. 
But since they may want to maintain their reputation as impartial broadcasters in the wake of new polemical channels, they could take a risk averse approach to campaign coverage. Rather than taking sides during the election, traditional broadcasters may stick to balancing, rather than scrutinising, competing political perspectives. 
Research shows this is what happened during the Brexit referendum campaign. While Remain and Leave campaigners received a broadly balanced amount of air time on the nightly news bulletins, their claims were not routinely scrutinised. In other words, impartiality was interpreted as covering both perspectives without taking sides. 
But, as Ofcom has indicated, impartial reporting entails more than balancing contrasting opinions. It involves journalists acting as referees who question and, when necessary, challenge politicians about any false or misleading claims.

The BBC has announced plans to fact-check the 2024 US presidential election. But research has shown the public service broadcaster appears reluctant to apply the same degree of journalistic scrutiny to domestic politicians. It occasionally uses fact-checking in its foreign affairs coverage, but rarely to counter political disinformation from the UK government or opposition parties. 
How impartiality is policed by Ofcom and interpreted by broadcasters will help voters understand the campaign. Journalism is not just about preventing partisanship, but holding parties to account. Ofcom has recommended that broadcasters more boldly challenge dubious political claims when necessary. And research shows audiences would welcome journalists taking this approach.

Why the US government is trying to break up Live Nation Entertainment â a music industry scholar explains,https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-government-is-trying-to-break-up-live-nation-entertainment-a-music-industry-scholar-explains-230832,3016270,"Music, Taylor Swift, Monopoly, Musicians, US Department of Justice, Music venues, Antitrust regulation, Concerts, Music fans, Musical concerts","
The U.S. Justice Department, along with 29 states and the District of Columbia, have filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster. 
The lawsuit alleges that Live Nation “engaged in a variety of tactics to eliminate competition and monopolize markets,” which, according to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, has allowed the entertainment giant to “suffocate the competition” through its control of ticket prices, venues and concert promotion.
In response, Live Nation said that the antitrust suit “ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.”
The Conversation U.S. asked David Arditi, a University of Texas at Arlington sociologist and former professional drummer who has researched the livelihoods of musicians, to explain what’s behind the government’s decision to intervene in the ticket-selling business.





What is the government accusing the company of doing?
The government alleges that Live Nation Entertainment’s sprawling business model is choking off competition and that the company is punishing venues that rely on other ticketing services.
Live Nation, the country’s largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster, the nation’s biggest ticket seller, had long been major players in the music industry. After the Justice Department approved a merger in 2010 between the two enterprises, the new company, Live Nation Entertainment, became far more powerful.
Live Nation Entertainment now controls many of the functions associated with putting on a concert: It owns venues, promotes concerts, books acts, produces shows, manages artists, sells tickets, and more.
Why is the Biden administration doing this?
After winning the 2020 presidential election, President Joe Biden promised to use the Justice Department’s antitrust division to break up monopolies, and that’s exactly what the government is trying to do with Live Nation Entertainment. 
The government has been investigating Live Nation Entertainment for decades. But after a botched Ticketmaster presale for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in late 2022 – which made it nearly impossible for fans to buy tickets at face value – government scrutiny intensified.
After that fiasco, fans started contacting their lawmakers, and the U.S. Senate even held a hearing on the issue. In May 2024, the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, signed a bill into law that will require all ticket sellers in the state to disclose their fees up front.
How did Ticketmaster change the ticket-buying experience?
For much of the 20th century, buying tickets to a show or sporting event required traveling to the venue’s box office.
In 1976, Albert Leffler, who worked at Arizona State University’s performing arts center, and Peter Gadwa, an IT staffer on the same campus, founded Ticketmaster with businessman Gordon Gunn III. The enterprise began to sell tickets a year later. As the company developed, it incorporated new technology to facilitate ticket sales at a growing list of locations outside of the venue where a show would be performed. 
Ticketmaster ultimately acquired Ticketron, its predecessor and rival.
As a teen in the 1990s, I remember waiting in line at a local grocery store in Williamsburg, Virginia, to buy tickets to a Dave Matthews Band show at the Virginia Beach Amphitheater. I had to be at the grocery store at 9 a.m. to purchase the tickets, but because it was a local Ticketmaster vendor, it saved me an hourlong trip to the venue.
A couple of years later, Ticketmaster introduced the technology required to give concertgoers the opportunity to purchase tickets online. In 2008, the company permitted paperless entry.
However, that convenience comes with hidden fees. Suddenly, the cost of your US$25 ticket can balloon to $40, with that extra $15 relatively opaque until checkout. These fees used to be a matter of convenience; there wasn’t a fee when you went to the venue to buy a ticket. 
Now, the fees are unavoidable and multiplying: There can be a service fee, an order processing charge, a facility charge and a delivery fee.

How has Live Nation affected artists’ ability to make a living?
In my research and my personal experience, I’ve observed a sea change in the roles that live music and recorded music are playing. 
From the 1970s to the 1990s, recording artists with medium-sized and large fan bases toured to promote their albums. During that time, these musicians assumed that they would take a loss on their tours; the payoff would come from their ability to sell more albums. Less prominent musicians, meanwhile, have always relied on playing at small venues to earn any income at all. 
With the advent of file-sharing services, which later gave way to streaming, recording artists began to rely more on touring revenue to supplement their income, as money earned from album sales fell. 
With even the most popular musicians increasingly relying on income from touring, they count more on making sure they earn what is owed to them. Fans feel like they have a close relationship with their favorite musicians and are willing to support them financially. 
But when Live Nation Entertainment adds fees or pressures musicians to take a smaller cut of concert revenue, it becomes apparent to fans that they and their favorite musicians are getting a raw deal.
What will happen moving forward?
The government will seek a jury trial to determine if Live Nation Entertainment is a monopoly. If the company is found to be violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Live Nation Entertainment would be forced to restructure, or even split into two or more separate companies. 
Of course, lawsuits take time to resolve, even if the parties settle before entering a courtroom. And any potential ruling could have to go through an appeals process. I believe it’s likely that this dispute won’t be resolved for several years.
Aside from the lawsuit, the Biden administration is working on banning so-called “junk fees.” Eliminating exorbitant or hidden fees on concert tickets would address some of these problems. 
Unfortunately, no matter what happens to Live Nation Entertainment, the music industry as a whole – whether it’s the record labels, streaming services, music publishers or music venues – is trending toward more consolidation and monopolistic behavior.

6 ways to encourage political discussion on college campuses,https://theconversation.com/6-ways-to-encourage-political-discussion-on-college-campuses-230365,3016269,"Politics, US higher education, College students, Dialogue, Political divide, Higher ed attainment, Political dialogue","
With deep divisions on college campuses – most recently over the conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel – many observers fear that universities are not places where students can discuss divisive issues with people who disagree with them. In my research and teaching, I have seen that students in fact want to have difficult conversations across divides, but they need support from faculty and other facilitators in order for these discussions to go well. 
Since early 2017, I have been observing events on college campuses in which students are brought together with peers with whom they disagree to talk about politics. In these sessions, facilitators provide students with guiding questions that help them to understand their peers’ political views. 
I conducted follow-up interviews with students a few weeks afterward and, when possible, three years later.
My aim is to understand what happens in these conversations. I want to know: Who learns what from whom? Who feels satisfied or frustrated, and why? And what does this all portend for America’s democracy?





The conversations I observed have taught me that six practices help to support a better experience for all students.
1. Set norms and expectations
When people talk about setting norms for conversation, they usually assume it is an effort to mandate speech rules. But norm-setting accomplishes something better than rule-following: It allows students to become sensitive to their own and others’ hopes and fears for the conversation. 
In my experience, opening the session with questions such as “What do you most hope will happen in this conversation?” “What worries you most about the conversation?” “What are you willing to give to it?” and “What do you hope to get from it?” can show students that they already share more than they anticipate. 
Moreover, this discussion leads naturally into the question of “How can we interact in a way that is most likely to realize our aims?” Students typically volunteer their own guidelines, such as assuming good faith, objecting to a person’s idea rather than attacking the person, honestly conveying when and why they feel hurt, and listening generously.
2. Allow students to tell their personal stories
Beginning with students’ personal stories lowers the barriers to entry, so that students who are not experts on politics can contribute. It allows students to feel heard about their direct experience. And it allows for what I have found to be the most profound outcome of dialogue: the shifts in how students feel about each other.  
For example, consider the “Can We Talk” campus dialogue series, which brings together ideologically diverse students for two-hour sessions in which facilitators provide a series of questions for students to ask each other. The sessions began with questions such as, “How were politics discussed in the home in which you were raised?” and “What is your earliest political memory?” before moving on to questions about students’ substantive views on relevant issues.
The focus of these sessions, which I observed in the 2017-2018 academic year at colleges throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is on cultivating students’ understanding of each other’s views and how they came to be.

If the dialogue is intended to focus on a specific issue, such as gun control, abortion or the war in Israel and Gaza, questions can be geared accordingly, such as “When did you first learn about this issue?” “How did it affect you at the time?” or “What about this issue draws you to this conversation?” 
3. Encourage curiosity
Students are often afraid that they will end up validating views they oppose unless they try to discredit those views. But in follow-up interviews I conducted three years after  their participation in a dialogue session,  I found that those students who did eventually change their political views were prompted to do so through sincere and nonthreatening questions. “I remember one girl asked me, ‘If you say you believe this, then why did you vote like that?’ I’ve been asking myself that question ever since,” admitted one student, whose politics changed considerably in the years between our first and second interviews. It mattered most that she felt questioned, not attacked. 
Questions can be encouraged throughout a conversation by reserving specific time for them in each round, as well as through directions such as “Think of one question you have always wanted to ask someone who thinks differently than you about this issue. Ask it now.” 
4. Dig into disagreement
One risk of emphasizing personal experience at the start is that students hesitate to dig into their disagreements. They want to be supportive, and it’s hard to argue with personal experience. In my research, though, I found that students ended up with the deepest respect for each other when they gained understanding of the nature of their disagreements.
Clarifying what is at stake in their differences allowed students to see that their opposition was not caused by ignorance, malice or madness on the other side, but legitimate contrasts in views of what is good and possible. 
After students have shared their views on issues and asked each other curiosity-oriented questions, they can be directed to ask each other questions such as “What is at the root of our disagreement?” and “What really matters to me, and to you, and is it the same thing? To the extent that it is not, why not?” 

5. Collaborate on next steps
Students tend to feel most satisfied when they can work toward a more concrete aim. Most ambitiously, this can involve real cooperative projects.
For example, the Sorenson Institute,  a political leadership institute at the University of Virginia, convenes dialogues that conclude with students putting together a proposal for the Virginia state Legislature on a specific topic such as gun control.
Even one-off conversations can conclude with what students might do differently on social media, on their campuses and in their families. When I followed up with them, I learned that many students had enacted these changes and found that people changed their own behavior in response. One student found that her uncle started reading and thinking about the articles she would send him. Another student discovered that peers in her political science class who had been dismissive of her in the past became respectful when she expressed her views and seemed to attend to them more sincerely.
6. Debrief
Some students will flourish in these conversations, while others will struggle. In my research, I found that students whose rights are threatened by policy proposals of the other side understandably experience the most difficulty. However, these same students’ experiences can be improved by debriefing with a trusted mentor afterward.
For example, one student who identifies as queer felt shaken after a discussion with peers who opposed her marriage rights. But meeting with a professor afterward helped her to feel empowered by the conversation, equipped with new knowledge to help her fight for a more just society. 
Listening to protest
Dialogue can deepen divides when it is presented as the only appropriate form of political communication, thereby silencing people who do not participate in these conversations. Students should be encouraged to also listen to messages conveyed through other means. For example, they can study protest movements – including ongoing, contemporary movements – and read the texts posted by activists who organize them.
It is important to convey to students that dialogue alone cannot solve all of what ails contemporary democracy. Protest, boycott and other forms of collective action matter, too.

What is a secular state? How South Africa has tried to separate religion and politics,https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-secular-state-how-south-africa-has-tried-to-separate-religion-and-politics-229637,3016125,"Secularism, Jacob Zuma, French secularism, Anti-Apartheid Movement, Dutch Reformed Church, South African constitution, Peace and Security, South African Council of Churches, South Africa election 2024","
The shifting relationship between state and religion has historically been a contested space, and the focus of much scholarship. It is important for observers to understand this unstable boundary, so that neither political nor religious actors undermine democratic freedoms. Calvin D. Ullrich, a theologian and philosopher of religion, examines the evolution of the state-religion context in South Africa.
South Africa is often referred to as a ‘secular state’. What’s the background?
The primary feature of a secular state is political secularism, which is the  attempt to draw distinctions between state and religious institutions and their activities. According to this definition, political secularism did not exist in South Africa at the time it was established as a unified country in 1910. In other words, no meaningful differentiation was made between the mechanisms of statecraft and religious institutions. Instead they were conflated as a violent politics of racial rule became sanctioned by these institutions. This crystallised into the system of apartheid.
Religion, thus, played a prominent role in public life in the last century. Christianity in particular was influential in fostering an apartheid philosophy. On the other hand, lone voices within the Dutch Reformed Church (the religious home of apartheid’s engineers) as well as a broad interfaith movement and ecumenical churches became an organisational bulwark in the struggle for political freedom.
The role of religion in the anti-apartheid movement was also a positive force of resistance.





This was the case in the build-up to the negotiated consensus in the early 1990s before the transition of power to black majority rule. For example, the Kairos Document, written by black theologians, articulated a theological statement condemning what it called “state theology”. Crucially, it called for direct Christian participation in the struggle, including acts of civil disobedience.

How has the relationship between state and religion evolved?
By the time negotiations began to roll back apartheid in the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s there was an atmosphere of constitutionalism and human rights which had taken hold. This meant a more moderate and tolerant fashioning of the state’s relation to religion as opposed to a hardline anti-religious stance.
The final outcome of the intense multiparty negotiation processes was a constitutionally enshrined protection of religious freedoms. Under this arrangement the state would be secular. But this political secularism would still carve out a space for religious activity at a distance from the state.
For example, it would allow voluntary religious observances within state institutions, such as prayer in state schools. This is a unique constitutional development. It differs from secular states with established churches, for example in the United Kingdom, Denmark and  Germany. 
It is also a contrast from a Jeffersonian “wall of separation” in the US, which strongly prohibits any mixture of religion and politics. Neither is it akin to French laïcité, which stresses the importance of the non-display of religious symbols. It also bears no similarity with the older Marxist formations aggressively banning religion as such. 
What’s happened since the dawn of democracy?
There are at least two consequences of the country’s formulation of political secularism in South Africa. 
Religious surplus: The first is what I would like to refer to as the phenomenon of “religious surplus”, which is to say that religion is simply on the rise. In South Africa, like many African countries, religious affiliation has increased among the population. 
According to the 2022 Census, the overwhelming majority (85.3%) identify as Christian, followed by African traditional religion (7.8%). These figures demonstrate an increase from the 2015 household survey by 2 percentage points and a 7 percentage point increase from the 2001 Census. Only 2.9% reported no affiliation in 2022.

      Watershed judgment clarifies limits of religion in South Africa's public schools




Moreover, the important role of religion in people’s lives remains high. According to a World Value Survey, the highest levels of trust are accorded to religious organisations. The private sector or state are less trusted. 
This helps us to see that, contrary to widely held opinions, official political secularism has almost no effect in making the public more secular. Or in other words, a progressive constitutional framework for state-religious relations in no way guarantees a more non-religious civil sphere. The significance of this can be seen in a second consequence.
Religious influence on political and public life: Given the vast constituencies that religious organisations command, the ebb and flow of religious influence on political and public life is therefore likely to continue. 
Political leaders continue to openly court religious groups of more Pentecostal and Charismatic orientation to harness support and seek legitimacy. A good example here was former president Jacob Zuma’s relations with the large Rhema Bible Church in the run up to elections. This is now a trend among politicians across the spectrum during election cycles.
Conversely, it is noteworthy that the formerly constructive stance of the South African Council of Churches towards the ANC government has changed. The influential ecumenical body, once resistant to the apartheid regime, has since become one of the staunchest critics of the ruling party.
What does this suggest down the line?
Can politics and religion ever be clearly separated? This is a topic I have addressed in my own work. I have argued that the category of secularism no longer does the conceptual work it supposes. What this means is that to adjudicate the boundaries between what counts as “secular” and “religious” proves impossible when privately held beliefs necessarily inform motivations, values, and judgements. To advocate for political secularism, then, does not always ensure the reduction of religious influence in political life. 
Therefore, secularism in South Africa won’t mean the absence of religion. Rather, political secularism will have to do with a tense negotiation between state and religious actors to control the boundaries of religion and politics. 
Paying attention to these actor’s ambitions and strategies will be necessary to ensure constitutional freedoms remain upheld.

Climate change may be fuelling a resurgence of piracy across Africa,https://theconversation.com/climate-change-may-be-fuelling-a-resurgence-of-piracy-across-africa-228739,3016060,"Climate change, Crime, Policing, Development, Trade, Piracy, Fisheries, Africa, Violence, Nigeria, Somalia, Fishing, Somalia piracy, Puntland, Gulf of Guinea, Give me perspective","
In the churning waters off Nigeria, armed pirates in small skiffs speed towards a cargo ship. They clamber aboard, seizing control of the vessel and its valuable cargo. This isn’t a scene from a swashbuckling film; it’s a stark reality for seafarers in many parts of the world. 
Piracy poses a threat to global shipping, trade and the safety of seafarers. In 2020 alone, there were 135 maritime kidnappings, with the Gulf of Guinea off the west African coast accounting for over 95% of abductions. Pirates often subject hostages to violence, torture and even execution.
What’s more concerning is that climate change seems to be making the problem worse. In regions like east Africa, climate change is devastating the coastal fisheries that people have depended on for generations.
Climate change is causing fish stocks to decline as some species migrate out of the reach of local fishermen. And prolonged drought and extreme weather have exacerbated food insecurity and poverty on land. Some former fishermen, in collaboration with militias and unemployed youth, have turned to piracy as a means of survival. 





Armed security measures in Somali waters over the past decade have successfully reduced the number of piracy incidents in the region. However, recent data suggests that piracy in Somalia is rearing its head again. In the first quarter of 2024, there were 33 incidents reported off the Somali coast, including two hijackings.
A similar story is unfolding thousands of kilometres away in the Gulf of Guinea. Piracy there is linked to oil theft by criminal groups who recruit impoverished youths to hijack tankers and siphon crude. Research has found that warming waters and rampant illegal fishing have decimated local fisheries and have left coastal residents with little to fall back on. 
In the Ivory Coast, the total catch fell by nearly 40% between 2003 and 2020. In Ghana, landings of small fish dropped by 59% between 1993 and 2019. And projections for these two countries and Nigeria suggest that the haul could plunge by another 50% by 2050.

The illicit profits from oil theft are immense. For Nigeria alone, these profits are estimated to be between US$3 billion (£2.35 billion) and US$8 billion each year. This dirty money fuels arms trafficking, corruption and lawlessness – a vicious cycle that undermines development and security efforts. 
As climate change and illegal fishing deepen poverty in the region, more desperate people may turn to maritime crime. This would perpetuate instability and threaten the safety of seafarers and global trade.
Tackling piracy’s roots
Investment in sustainable fishing, alternative livelihoods and economic development in coastal regions made vulnerable by climate change are essential to stem the rising tide of piracy. 
The Puntland Maritime Police Force, a security force based in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland in north-eastern Somalia, curbed piracy in Somali waters effectively after its formation in 2010. Pirate attacks off the Somali coast fell from a peak of 237 in 2011 to just nine in 2017.
By patrolling territorial waters, the force deters pirate activity and intercepts attacks before they happen. It also focuses on training and equipping local authorities, fostering a sense of ownership in maritime security. 
Alongside security measures, the Puntland Maritime Police Force has helped build coastal communities that are more resilient to the effects of climate change. With the support of the United Arab Emirates, it is investing in infrastructure projects like schools, hospitals and roads, while also supporting alternative livelihoods through fishing cooperatives and vocational training programmes.
The success of the Puntland Maritime Police Force showcases the effectiveness of an approach that addresses both the symptoms and the underlying causes of maritime crime.

Climate change is not solely responsible for the resurgence in pirate activity. Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is further depleting fish stocks and damaging marine habitats. This, alongside climate change, limited economic alternatives and weak governance, is creating conditions that are conducive to the rise of piracy. 
Thus, cracking down on illegal fishing and improving maritime surveillance capabilities can also contribute to tackling piracy. In Somalia, the EU’s satellite monitoring systems have helped to track fishing vessel activity in the region and deter the illegal fishing that can fuel piracy.
And information sharing initiatives between countries are fostering greater regional cooperation and enabling a more coordinated response to maritime threats. The so-called Shared Awareness and Deconfliction initiative in the Gulf of Guinea, for example, involves regular meetings between navies, coastguards and industry stakeholders to share intelligence, coordinate patrols and develop best practices for maritime security in the region.
Ultimately, piracy is a symptom of the wider instability caused by climate change in many of the world’s most vulnerable coastal regions. Inaction will put more lives at risk and threaten the maritime trade that powers the global economy.
The surge of piracy in the world’s warming waters is a forewarning. It shows how quickly communities can destabilise when climate change erodes traditional livelihoods. Defusing this threat will require a more sustainable, equitable and climate-resilient future for coastal communities – before more desperate people turn to piracy to survive.

âItâs between us and gangsâ: teachers are on the front line against youth violence,https://theconversation.com/its-between-us-and-gangs-teachers-are-on-the-front-line-against-youth-violence-230610,3016059,"Teachers, London, Gang violence, UK Schools, knife crime, County Lines, Educate me","
Gang violence and knife crime threaten the lives and future of young people. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that in London, knife crime increased by 22% in the year up to September 2023. 
County line gangs have capitalised on reductions in youth services, such as cuts to funding for after school clubs, to recruit an increasing number of vulnerable young people to traffic drugs from cities into smaller towns and rural areas. Knife carrying is seen as a required form of protection against rival gangs.
In 2015, the British school inspectorate Ofsted published guidance for schools, making clear they have a role to play in addressing gang violence. Secondary schools have “a duty and a responsibility to protect their pupils”. 
My recent research in an east London secondary school gives insight into the challenges that teachers are facing in addressing gang violence.





I worked with six teachers, holding individual interviews and a focus group discussion to discuss their experiences of dealing with gang membership. All of the teachers’ names have been anonymised. 




      Read more:
      Rising knife crime in London is linked to austerity cuts to youth services – here’s the evidence




It was clear to the teachers that some of their pupils were involved with gangs. Hamza noted that gangs were attracting children of an increasingly young age:

I’ve been here six years now, and I’ve seen in the last three or four years how it’s getting, you know, worse. At first you think, you know, sixteen, seventeen – seventeen is the peak offending age. And now we have kids who are in year nine, 14 years old, on the fringes or actively getting involved.

The teachers talked about how gangs filled the gaps left when children were by themselves. Rohan explained that many parents had several jobs and worked long hours to make ends meet. In the absence of parents or youth services, gangs could take advantage of vulnerable young people outside school:

So it’s … the concept is they have no parental control as soon as they leave us, and maybe their parents get back at six or seven. So they’ve got like a three-hour gap of where they’re chilling in the park, chilling in the road. And they have that … older boys have the opportunity with the boys. And they just get them in that way, say buy them trainers, buy them a top…

Another teacher, Ana, said that gangs offered vulnerable students a sense of belonging, as well as food or material goods. “It’s definitely a sense of community, and they’re like family, basically,” she said. “And so it’s like if they’re – if that’s the only person who’s kind of offering you that… sanctuary, well, immediately, that’s something desirable.”

Other studies confirm that gangs offer a sense of belonging and act as family systems.
Research shows that inequality, poverty, and lack of social and economic opportunities are risk factors for gang involvement. This challenges racialised depictions of gang violence in the British media, pointing instead to the socioeconomic roots of the issue.
Teachers’ work
The end of the school day was at a different time to other schools in the borough, so that students would not be leaving at the same time as potential rival gang members from different schools. Teachers acted as monitors at the school gates, and were also required to control violence during the school day. Hamza said: 

You know, there was an incident … a child in my year group a few weeks ago. He’s involved in gangs. He had an issue with another boy in the school whose brother is in a rival gang. They had a bit of a fight. We tried to stop him. We restrained him. 

In the focus group, teachers described themselves as “security guards” and “police officers”:

Ana: [We’re] psychologists, parents, police officers, security-
Hamza: Social workers-
Kate: Yeah, security guard … It’s quite suffocating, I find. It’s like, you never feel like you can go home and think, right, we did that, that’s sorted.
Hamza: It’s an unforgiving job.

Hamza felt that teachers were having to take on responsibilities that went far beyond their role as educators – and that they were stepping into a gap left by others. “It’s between us and gangs,” he said, talking of the choices young people were making in their teens.

It’s literally, we’re being told by the government to do all these things that, you know, we’re not trained for, we’re not paid for. And, you know, it’s not our job. But I see the government and the parents, kind of, you know, they take a bit of a backseat. And we’re put on the frontline along with the police…

Schools and teachers cannot address gang violence on their own – and they should not have to. Rather, whole communities should be involved in tackling youth violence, with the government support they need.

Multiple sclerosis: blood test that tracks immune response could be first step in developing better treatments,https://theconversation.com/multiple-sclerosis-blood-test-that-tracks-immune-response-could-be-first-step-in-developing-better-treatments-230270,3016058,"Multiple Sclerosis, Immune system, Viral infections, Immune response, MS, Epstein-Barr virus, Educate me","
An estimated 2.8 million people worldwide have multiple sclerosis (MS). This autoimmune condition is the result of the immune system damaging parts of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to problems with movement, vision, balance and sensation. 
While many MS symptoms can be managed, there’s currently no way to cure or prevent the condition. This is due to the complex immune response that leads to this disease. But a blood test recently developed by me and my colleagues has allowed us to estimate the strength of the immune response in people with MS.
This finding may not only bring us one step closer to understanding the causes of MS, but to developing better treatments for the condition.
Researchers still aren’t entirely sure what exactly causes MS. But a growing body of evidence suggests the main driver of the condition is Epstein-Barr virus (also known as glandular fever or infectious mononucleosis).





Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is spread through saliva and typically infects children at a young age. Symptoms are often mild, resembling the common cold. But for others they may have a sore throat and high levels of fatigue.
However, the body never actually clears the virus. In most people, the immune system renders it harmless. But people with MS have an abnormal immune response to this virus – which may be responsible for the disease. 
The link between Epstein-Barr virus and MS has been considered for over 20 years, with multiple studies highlighting the high prevalence of this virus in people with MS. But in 2022, a large study of more than 10 million young adults finally provided a robust, epidemiological basis for this link. 
The study, which followed participants for 20 years, found that risk of MS increased 32-fold after an EBV infection. No other viral infections were shown to increase MS risk. 
Work has also shown that the proteins which comprise EBNA-1 (a component of Epstein-Barr virus) and myelin (the outside coating of our nerves), share a similar structure. Myelin normally keeps our nerves healthy, but in people with MS the immune system recognises myelin as a foreign invader and attacks it. 
This finding provides an important starting point for research investigating the mechanisms behind the aberrant immune reaction that leads to MS. It may also allow researchers to some day develop better treatments for MS.
MS blood test
MS symptoms are typically managed using immunosuppressive drugs. These suppress the body’s overall immune response, which can reduce the severity of MS symptoms.
But these drugs have many unwanted side-effects, including headaches, stomach pain and gastrointestinal problems. And, because they modify the immune system’s response, this can result in more frequent chest, sinus or bladder infections.
Antiviral drugs could be another possible treatment route. These target a specific virus in the body and prevent it from replicating. Because these only target one specific virus, they don’t dampen the body’s overall immune system.
There have been a series of intriguing case reports of people with MS who also developed HIV and were given antivirals –  a standard part of HIV care, as they stop the virus replicating itself. 
The surprising consequence was that these people’s MS symptoms appeared to resolve. This suggests antivirals could be a useful treatment. By preventing EBV from replicating in the body, it could help put MS into remission.

But in order to develop an antiviral, we need to know just how strong of a response the immune system is mounting against EBV in patients with MS. 
With this in mind me and my colleagues developed a blood test that quantifies the body’s immune response to EBV. 
To test if it worked, we took blood samples from people with MS, epilepsy and those with no existing medical conditions. We looked at 145 people in total and also confirmed with laboratory testing that each person had signs of previous EBV infection. 
Although our main focus was MS, we wanted to compare how these participants’ immune responses differed compared to people with no existing health conditions, and against people with a different neurological condition that isn’t linked to EBV. 
We found that the immune response to EBV was higher in people with MS than it was in people from either of the two other groups. This provides support for the idea that it is the immune response to EBV that is responsible for causing MS.
We also saw that current MS drugs do influence the immune system’s response to EBV. Drugs that deplete circulating immune cells (known as B cells) were shown in MS patients to create an immune response to EBV that was equivalent to the immune response healthy participants had to the virus. 
We were interested in this result as the precise mechanism of action these B cell depleting drugs have in MS has not been understood. One theory has been that these drugs clear EBV from the system by attacking the B cells that the virus hides behind. It has been difficult to prove this, but we believe our study’s finding support this theory.
One of the leading aims of our study has been to develop a potential way to record the effect of drugs that target EBV in MS in clinical trials. We believe that testing for virus levels alone would not suffice, as the disease is caused by an immune response. We believe our new blood test has the potential to be used in future clinical trials using antivirals or vaccines against EBV in MS.

Hit Me Hard And Soft by Billie Eilish review â a flowing queer triumph that celebrates the album as a form,https://theconversation.com/hit-me-hard-and-soft-by-billie-eilish-review-a-flowing-queer-triumph-that-celebrates-the-album-as-a-form-230827,3016057,"Music, Queer culture, Music review, Billie Eilish","
Billie Eilish’s new album Hit Me Hard and Soft is already fast on its way to becoming her third consecutive number one album. This album is reminiscent of her first – where her second album Happier Than Ever looked forwards, “I’m in love with my future, can’t wait to meet her”, this album looks backwards, showing grief and love for her 2019 self. It is, in her own words, “the most ‘me’ thing that [she’s] ever made”.. 
Notably, the album has been released without singles. Eilish explained her logic behind this in Rolling Stone:

Every single time an artist I love puts out a single without the context of the album, I’m just already prone to hating on it. I really don’t like when things are out of context.

For Eilish and her song-writing partner, producer and brother Finneas, this is their response to the removal of songs not only from their album context but from their musical surroundings, with the clipping of songs on TikTok creating viral sounds out of five to ten second bites. In resisting singularity, Eilish follows the likes of Prince, who famously proclaimed at the 2015 Grammys, “albums, like books and black lives, still matter”.
This design of the album as a whole is apparent from the production. Songs flow into each other and often the tune or harmony of the next song occurs before the previous song ends, displacing where the songs start.






We hear this at the end of Skinny, where romantic strings (played by the Attaca Quartet) fade out, before a heavy synthesized beat enters at 3:36, leading into the track Lunch. This encourages us as listeners to listen to the album as a whole, because splitting the songs up would leave a jarring beat floating at the end of one song with no payoff to the other.
Songs across the album will often start one way and end in a very different style. Bittersuite begins with dense synths, fades into sparse, bossa-nova influenced glockenspiel backing and then ends back on droning synths and the tune of the final track, Blue. 
The string motif from Blue is teased in the first track Skinny and can be heard in The Greatest, comes halfway through. The motif flows from the very first to the very last track, cementing the work as an “album-ass album” . Across its 44-minute length, Hit Me Hard and Soft encourages us to play through, to slow down, and float through the album.

This whole album is fluid and watery – and not just the album cover, the shoot for which required Eilish to spend six hours underwater. Water itself is the ultimate hard and soft – it can both flow gently and become a hard immovable force when hit too forcefully. But musically the album also evokes this sense of being underwater, often due to Finneas’s production.
Multiple songs feature heavy filters, which make Eilish sound far away or underwater. For example, the middle of L'Amour De Ma Vie features Eilish’s voice put through multiple filters and possibly pitch-altered up, giving her voice a far away, ethereal quality. 
The end of Wildflower is similar. The song’s separated coda section also features Eilish’s voice heavily filtered, her voice multiplied and split into open octaves, making it sound like an echo. 
The Greatest, arguably the emotional climax of the album, features fluid time-signature changes in the middle, which again signify a kind of watery drift. This is because we cannot predict where the beat will come, as the stresses are uneven, we must simply submit to the song’s ebb and flow.

The lack of singles should not imply that there are no stand-out songs on this album. Lunch is fast becoming a queer summer anthem, cementing Billie’s place as a queer icon and officially adding “to the canon of great songs about eating someone out”. This is currently the only song on the album to have a music video, and it evokes the late 1990s/early 2000s through using digital cameras and retro video effects.
Through references to this era, Eilish makes the song’s explicitly queer nature that much more stark – she retrofits the past with the explicitly queer sexual pop that so many of us craved. As multiple YouTube commenters have noted on the music video, Lunch sees Katy Perry’s 2008 hit I Kissed A Girl, which centres sapphic desire around the male gaze and, in stark contrast, unabashedly shouts about the joys of queer sex:

I could eat that girl for lunch
Yeah, she dances on my tongue
Tastes like she might be the one…
Oh I just wanna get her off

Eilish has described this song as “actually part of what helped me become who I am”. This song is an act of self-actualisation, then, not just for Billie but for the rest of us who grew up queer in the early 2000s. And it’s a banger.

Why itâs not âalrightâ if your dog is friendly,https://theconversation.com/why-its-not-alright-if-your-dog-is-friendly-226648,3016056,"Animal welfare, Animal behaviour, Animals, Dogs, Dangerous dogs, Walking, Dog bites, Educate me","
A series of recent attacks by XL bully type dogs in the UK, and government attempts to both define and control the breed, has refocused attention on how society manages “dangerous dogs”.
Much media coverage focuses on the trauma that pets or humans endure after they’ve been attacked by an XL bully, or protests from XL bully owners that their dogs are being unfairly singled out. 
But my research showed that many owners have to deal with problematic behaviour when walking their dogs. Many of my research participants advocated closer control of all dogs in public, or at least a recognition that some dogs need to be given more space.
From February 2024 it became a criminal offence to own an XL Bully dog in England and Wales unless it has a certificate of exemption, third party insurance, and is leashed and muzzled in public. 





But aggression and other unwanted behaviour are not restricted to certain breeds. Even pets from usually docile breeds can display confrontational behaviour while out for a walk. 

Owners often resort to great lengths to manage these behavioural challenges, demonstrated by the many television programmes on dog training that are a staple of evening schedules (such as Channel 5’s Dogs Behaving Very Badly).
I explored the experiences of caring for dogs that fall short of our expectations. It detailed the social and emotional toll for owners, who reported feelings of exclusion and dislocation. The research also identified the tactics adopted by walkers in an attempt to make walks a more convivial experience. 
Walking that ‘wild dog of yours’
It is long recognised that dog walking has health and social benefits for both the walker and the dog. Dogs can build trust and  strengthen relationships between people and the communities they live in. However, many dogs have behavioural issues that limit these benefits. 




      Read more:
      For better or worse, your dog's behaviours can impact your quality of life




My interest in this topic stemmed from my experience of adopting Tommy – a Jack Russell who lived for around 16 years. On walks, Tommy barked and strained at other dogs. His behaviour became so extreme it prevented any amiable interaction with fellow dog walkers. One family member once referred to him as “that wild dog of yours”. Walks were isolating experiences for my partner and I, rather than a source of social interaction. 

Realising that I was not alone in this experience prompted my research. 
Participants described a catalogue of incidents where their dog’s behaviour created tension with – and detachment from – fellow walkers. One spoke regretfully about how their experience didn’t live up to their romanticised expectations of having a dog. Another described how their dog’s behaviour solicited gazes of disapproval from other dog walkers:
“People look at you, staring. Sometimes they’ll say something too – like tell you what to do. ‘Let him off the lead’, or ask ‘can’t you train him better?’ They probably don’t mean to make you feel bad but you still do.” 
My research also documented how some encounters led to confrontation between owners. 
Several respondents were concerned about the behaviour of other dogs, particularly those unleashed and free to “invade” their dog’s space. One interviewee said:

Dogs that are off the lead are a real pain … They’re not actually being        aggressive – just want a sniff and to say hello. But you know my dog is       aggressive and under control. Your dog might not be aggressive – but is it        under control? I don’t think so!

Negotiating troubled dog walks
Walks sometimes left human companions feeling frustrated with their dogs, isolated from fellow walkers and alienated from their local community. This was not what they believed owning a dog would entail. 
Yet owners retained an acute sense of obligation to walk their dogs, adopting a careful choreography to avoid social contact with fellow walkers. 
This ranged from choosing specific routes to avoiding crowded areas or walking at quieter times of the day. They also made tactical use of features on streets and neighbourhoods. For instance street furniture, vegetation, and parked vehicles were used to disrupt sight lines between dogs. 
Others walked in places where dog access or freedom was restricted in the hope that the animals they encountered would be more predictable:

I love seeing dog walking restrictions, when it’s the lambing season or places where dogs are allowed but only on leads…you’ll come across dogs but they won’t get up close and personal

Ironically, many owners avoided dog-friendly places such as parks, pubs, cafes and events.
There were, however, more positive experiences. Walkers described how their attempts to accommodate problematic behaviour led them to seek new, previously unexplored places where dogs aren’t allowed off the lead. Small networks of walkers with similar experiences formed, forging the solidarity and sociability that many had hoped dog companionship would have brought from the outset. 
Some dogs just need more space
My research provides an insight into the challenges that many face when venturing into the outside world with a dog that is nervous, anxious or that displays aggression. 

Greater awareness of why many dogs must be under close control, education campaigns on leashing and ultimately the encouragement of more responsible dog ownership is required to ensure there is space in society for all our canine companions.

How the 18th-century âprobability revolutionâ fueled the casino gambling craze,https://theconversation.com/how-the-18th-century-probability-revolution-fueled-the-casino-gambling-craze-228347,3016055,"Gambling, Mathematics, History, Britain, Probability, Casinos, Sports betting, betting odds, Chance, Odds, 18th century","
The first commercial gambling operations emerged, coincidentally or not, at the same time as the study of mathematical probability in the mid-1600s. 
By the early 1700s, commercial gambling operations were widespread in European cities such as London and Paris. But in many of the games that were offered, players faced steep odds. 
Then, in 1713, the brothers Johann and Jacob Bernoulli proved their “Golden Theorem,” known now as the law of large numbers or long averages. 
But gambling entrepreneurs were slow to embrace this theorem, which showed how it could actually be an advantage for the house to have a smaller edge over a larger one. 





In my book “The Gambling Century: Commercial Gaming in Britain from Restoration to Regency,” I explain how it took government efforts to ban and regulate betting for gambling operators to finally understand just how much money could be made off a miniscule house edge. 
The illusion of even odds in games that were the ancestors of roulette and blackjack proved immensely profitable, sparking a “probability revolution” that transformed gambling in Britain and beyond.
A new theorem points to sneaky big profits
The law of large numbers refers to events governed by chance. 
When you flip a coin, for example, you have a 50% – or “even money” – chance of getting heads or tails. Were you to flip a coin 10 times, it’s quite possible that heads will turn up seven times and tails three times. But after 100, or 1000, or 10,000 flips, the ratio of “heads” to “tails” will be closer and closer to the mathematical “mean of probability” – that is, half heads and half tails.

This principle was popularized by writers such as Abraham De Moivre, who applied them to games of chance. 
De Moivre explained how, over time, someone with even the smallest statistical “edge” would eventually win almost all of the money that was staked. 
This is what happens in roulette. The game has 36 numbers, 18 of which are red and 18 of which are black. However, there are also two green house numbers – “0” and “00” – which, if the ball lands on them, means that the house can take everyone’s wager. This gives the house a small edge. 
Imagine 10 players with $100 apiece. Half of them bet $10 on red and the other half bet $10 on black. Assuming that the wheel strictly aligns with the mean of probability, the house will break even for 18 of 19 spins. But on the 19th spin, the ball will land on one of the green “house numbers,” allowing the house to collect all the money staked from all bettors. 
After 100 spins, the house will have won half of the players’ money. After 200 spins, they’ll have won all of it.
Even with a single house number – the single 0 on the roulette wheels introduced in Monte Carlo by the casino entrepreneur Louis Blanc – the house would win everything after 400 spins. 
This eventuality, as De Moivre put it, “will seem almost incredible given the smallness of the odds.”
Hesitating to test the math
As De Moivre anticipated, gamblers and gambling operators were slow to adopt these findings. 
De Moivre’s complex mathematical equations were over the heads of gamblers who hadn’t mastered simple arithmetic.
Gambling operators didn’t initially buy into the Golden Theorem, either, seeing it as unproven and therefore risky. 
Instead, they played it safe by promoting games with long odds. 
One was the Royal Oak Lottery, a game played with a polyhedral die with 32 faces, like a soccer ball. Players could bet on individual numbers or combinations of two or four numbers, giving them, at best, 7-to-1 odds of winning. 
Faro was another popular game of chance in which the house, or “bank” as it was then known, gave players the opportunity to defer collecting their winnings for chances at larger payouts at increasingly steep odds. 

These games – and others played against a bank – were highly profitable to gambling entrepreneurs, who operated out of taverns, coffeehouses and other similar venues. “Keeping a common gaming house” was illegal, but with the law riddled with loopholes, enforcement was lax and uneven. 
Public outcry against the Royal Oak Lottery was such that the Lottery Act of 1699 banned it. A series of laws enacted in the 1730s and 1740s classified faro and other games as illegal lotteries, on the grounds that the odds of winning or losing were not readily apparent to players.  
The law of averages put into practice
Early writers on probability had asserted that the “house advantage” did not have to be very large for a gambling operation to profit enormously. The government’s effort to ban games of chance now obliged gaming operators to put the law of long averages into practice.
Further statutes outlawed games of chance played with dice, cards, wheels or any other device featuring “numbers or figures.” 
None of these measures deterred gambling operators from the pursuit of profit.
Since this language did not explicitly include letters, the game of EO, standing for “even odd,” was introduced in the mid 1740s, after the last of these gambling statutes was enacted. It was played on a wheel with 40 slots, all but two of which were marked either “E” or “O.” As in roulette, an ivory ball was rolled along the edge of the wheel as it was spun. If the ball landed in one of the two blank “bar holes,” the house would automatically win, similar to the “0” and “00” in roulette. 
EO’s defenders could argue that it was not an unlawful lottery because the odds of winning or losing were now readily apparent to players and appeared to be virtually equal. The key, of course, is that the bar holes ensured they weren’t truly equal. 
Although this logic might not stand up in court, overburdened law enforcement was happy for a reason to look the other way. EO proliferated; legislation to outlaw it was proposed in 1782 but failed.
The allure of ‘even money’
Gambling operators may have even realized that evening the odds drew more players, who, in turn, staked more. 
After EO appeared in Britain, gambling operations both there and on the continent of Europe introduced “even money” betting options into both new and established games.

For example, the game of biribi, which was popular in France throughout the 18th century, involved players betting on numbers from 1 to 72, which were shown on a betting cloth. Numbered beads would then be drawn from a bag to determine the win. 
In one iteration from around 1720, players could bet on individual numbers, on vertical columns of six numbers, or other options that promised large payouts against steeper odds. 
By the end of the 18th century, however, one biribi cloth featured even money options: Players could bet on any number between 36 and 70 being drawn, or on any number between 1 and 35. Players could also select red or black numbers, making it a likely inspiration for roulette.
In Britain, the Victorian ethos of morality and respectability eventually won out. Parliament outlawed games of chance played for money in public or private in 1845, restrictions that were not lifted until 1960.  
By 1845, however, British gamblers could travel by steamship and train to one of the many European resorts cropping up across the continent, where the probability revolution had transformed casino gambling into the formidable business enterprise it is today.

Why the US government is intervening in the live music business and could break up Live Nation Entertainment â a music industry scholar explains,https://theconversation.com/why-the-us-government-is-intervening-in-the-live-music-business-and-could-break-up-live-nation-entertainment-a-music-industry-scholar-explains-230832,3016054,"Music, Taylor Swift, Monopoly, Musicians, US Department of Justice, Music venues, Antitrust regulation, Concerts, Music fans, Musical concerts","
The U.S. Justice Department, along with 29 states and the District of Columbia, have filed an antitrust lawsuit against Live Nation Entertainment, the parent company of Ticketmaster. 
The lawsuit alleges that Live Nation “engaged in a variety of tactics to eliminate competition and monopolize markets,” which, according to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, has allowed the entertainment giant to “suffocate the competition” through its control of ticket prices, venues and concert promotion.
In response, Live Nation said that the antitrust suit “ignores everything that is actually responsible for higher ticket prices, from increasing production costs to artist popularity, to 24/7 online ticket scalping that reveals the public’s willingness to pay far more than primary tickets cost.”
The Conversation U.S. asked David Arditi, a University of Texas at Arlington sociologist and former professional drummer who has researched the livelihoods of musicians, to explain what’s behind the government’s decision to intervene in the ticket-selling business.





What is the government accusing the company of doing?
The government alleges that Live Nation Entertainment’s sprawling business model is choking off competition and that the company is punishing venues that rely on other ticketing services.
Live Nation, the country’s largest concert promoter, and Ticketmaster, the nation’s biggest ticket seller, had long been major players in the music industry. After the Justice Department approved a merger in 2010 between the two enterprises, the new company, Live Nation Entertainment, became far more powerful.
Live Nation Entertainment now controls many of the functions associated with putting on a concert: It owns venues, promotes concerts, books acts, produces shows, manages artists, sells tickets, and more.
Why is the Biden administration doing this?
After winning the 2020 presidential election, President Joe Biden promised to use the Justice Department’s antitrust division to break up monopolies, and that’s exactly what the government is trying to do with Live Nation Entertainment. 
The government has been investigating Live Nation Entertainment for decades. But after a botched Ticketmaster presale for Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour in late 2022 – which made it nearly impossible for fans to buy tickets at face value – government scrutiny intensified.
After that fiasco, fans started contacting their lawmakers, and the U.S. Senate even held a hearing on the issue. In May 2024, the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, signed a bill into law that will require all ticket sellers in the state to disclose their fees up front.
How did Ticketmaster change the ticket-buying experience?
For much of the 20th century, buying tickets to a show or sporting event required traveling to the venue’s box office.
In 1976, Albert Leffler, who worked at Arizona State University’s performing arts center, and Peter Gadwa, an IT staffer on the same campus, founded Ticketmaster with businessman Gordon Gunn III. The enterprise began to sell tickets a year later. As the company developed, it incorporated new technology to facilitate ticket sales at a growing list of locations outside of the venue where a show would be performed. 
Ticketmaster ultimately acquired Ticketron, its predecessor and rival.
As a teen in the 1990s, I remember waiting in line at a local grocery store in Williamsburg, Virginia, to buy tickets to a Dave Matthews Band show at the Virginia Beach Amphitheater. I had to be at the grocery store at 9 a.m. to purchase the tickets, but because it was a local Ticketmaster vendor, it saved me an hourlong trip to the venue.
A couple of years later, Ticketmaster introduced the technology required to give concertgoers the opportunity to purchase tickets online. In 2008, the company permitted paperless entry.
However, that convenience comes with hidden fees. Suddenly, the cost of your US$25 ticket can balloon to $40, with that extra $15 relatively opaque until checkout. These fees used to be a matter of convenience; there wasn’t a fee when you went to the venue to buy a ticket. 
Now, the fees are unavoidable and multiplying: There can be a service fee, an order processing charge, a facility charge and a delivery fee.

How has Live Nation affected artists’ ability to make a living?
In my research and my personal experience, I’ve observed a sea change in the roles that live music and recorded music are playing. 
From the 1970s to the 1990s, recording artists with medium-sized and large fan bases toured to promote their albums. During that time, these musicians assumed that they would take a loss on their tours; the payoff would come from their ability to sell more albums. Less prominent musicians, meanwhile, have always relied on playing at small venues to earn any income at all. 
With the advent of file-sharing services, which later gave way to streaming, recording artists began to rely more on touring revenue to supplement their income, as money earned from album sales fell. 
With even the most popular musicians increasingly relying on income from touring, they count more on making sure they earn what is owed to them. Fans feel like they have a close relationship with their favorite musicians and are willing to support them financially. 
But when Live Nation Entertainment adds fees or pressures musicians to take a smaller cut of concert revenue, it becomes apparent to fans that they and their favorite musicians are getting a raw deal.
What will happen moving forward?
The government will seek a jury trial to determine if Live Nation Entertainment is a monopoly. If the company is found to be violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, Live Nation Entertainment would be forced to restructure, or even split into two or more separate companies. 
Of course, lawsuits take time to resolve, even if the parties settle before entering a courtroom. And any potential ruling could have to go through an appeals process. I believe it’s likely that this dispute won’t be resolved for several years.
Aside from the lawsuit, the Biden administration is working on banning so-called “junk fees.” Eliminating exorbitant or hidden fees on concert tickets would address some of these problems. 
Unfortunately, no matter what happens to Live Nation Entertainment, the music industry as a whole – whether it’s the record labels, streaming services, music publishers or music venues – is trending toward more consolidation and monopolistic behavior.

Why Polandâs new government is challenged by abortion,https://theconversation.com/why-polands-new-government-is-challenged-by-abortion-228863,3016053,"Abortion, Poland, Reproductive rights, European politics, Donald Tusk, Central Europe, Religion and society","
When Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk formed a coalition government in 2023 committed to making “historic changes,” he promised to improve the country’s track record on women’s rights. Noticeably absent in the coalition’s agreement, however, was any specific wording on access to abortion, one of the most controversial issues under the previous government.
The coalition parties are united in their opposition to the conservative Law and Justice Party, PiS, which led the government for eight years. PiS weakened Poland’s democracy by undermining the independence of the judiciary and placing restrictions on the media, and it strained its relationship with the European Union. PiS also ushered in some of the strictest abortion laws in Europe, with the help of hand-picked judges from Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal.
Poland’s three main coalition partners – the Civic Coalition, the Third Way and The Left – all want to soften Poland’s near-ban on abortion. Yet they disagree on how this should happen and how far the changes should go, meaning the government is struggling to deliver on its campaign promises.
As a scholar of civil society in central Europe, I have followed abortion debates in Poland for years. Poles’ views of abortion are shaped by religious, historical, political and cultural factors that make legislative changes challenging, despite the fact that most Poles favor some change in the current laws.





From strict to stricter
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland’s Constitutional Tribunal made a significant change in Poland’s already strict abortion laws, prompting massive protests. The court removed the right to abortions because of birth defects, which had accounted for more than 90% of all abortions.
Since January 2021, abortion has been allowed only in cases of rape, incest or when a mother’s health is in danger. Under these laws, which also allowed the former government to arrest people for abortion-related activities, about half a dozen women experiencing pregnancy complications have died after being denied abortions.

In January 2024, the new government reversed PiS legislation from 2017 that required women to obtain a doctor’s prescription for over-the-counter emergency contraception, often called the morning-after pill. However, Polish President Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS, vetoed the bill. 
Church and culture
Sixty percent of the Polish population thinks abortion should be legal, according to a 2022 global survey by Ipsos. Less than 25%, however, are in favor of abortion being legal without any restrictions.
Those who oppose abortion are a vocal and well-organized group. On April 14, 2024, tens of thousands of people joined a National March for Life through Warsaw. Organizers estimated that at least 50,000 people participated, claiming that it was the largest Polish anti-abortion gathering in the 21st century.
Abortion opponents are supported by the Catholic Church, which remains a powerful institution in Poland despite declining church attendance. In 1992, weekly church attendance was about 70%; by 2021, it had decreased to 43%. Just a year later, another study found that only 30% of Polish Catholics regularly attend Sunday Mass.

At the same time, almost 70% of Poles say that God plays an important role in their life. Especially in smaller cities and rural areas, social and family activities tend to revolve around the church and religious holidays.  
The Catholic Church’s close relationship with Polish national identity stems from the role it has played in the country’s history. Throughout the 19th century, when Polish lands were divided by its stronger neighbors, the Catholic faith allowed Poles to maintain their language and traditions. When Poland reemerged on the map after World War I, the church was the basis for unity as leaders struggled to create political, economic and social institutions.
During the communist period of 1947 to 1989, the church was a symbol of Polish independence in the face of Soviet attempts to impose atheist beliefs within its sphere of influence. Political analysts such as George Weigel maintain that the Catholic Church and Pope John Paul II, a native of Poland, were important to shaping anti-communist movements throughout the Soviet bloc.

Splintered support
This landscape of views on abortion and faith and Poland’s unique history explains why political support for various proposals is so fragmented.
Two of the government’s coalition parties, the Civic Coalition and the Left, favor abortion without restrictions until 12 weeks. The Third Way, itself a coalition of center-right parties, prefers to simply restore the right to abortion in the case of birth defects.
Third Way politicians claim that this “compromise” legislation has the support of many groups and so is more likely to be approved. The group has also called for a national referendum about whether to further loosen abortion restrictions. This proposal reflects the Third Way’s main political goal: to distinguish itself as an alternative to polarization and deadlock.
Regardless of which proposal the Legislature supports, Duda may veto the legislation. Conservative legislators are also well positioned to delay any reforms. Recently, the leader of PiS indicated that he is now in favor of softening the near-ban on abortion, but only if there is a change in Poland’s constitution – a lengthy process that is unlikely to receive enough support.
Almost all European countries have legalized abortion, although some maintain medical or regulatory procedures such as short wait times or permission from a parent or guardian. If this trend is any indication, Poland will indeed liberalize its abortion laws – and given the country’s national health care system, procedures will likely be paid for by the state. It will take time, however, and the battles will continue to be hard-fought.

Muslim women who are registered to vote are more likely to donate money and volunteer than nonvoters,https://theconversation.com/muslim-women-who-are-registered-to-vote-are-more-likely-to-donate-money-and-volunteer-than-nonvoters-227315,3016052,"Volunteering, Muslims, Muslim women, Giving, Quick reads, Zakat, Philanthropy and nonprofits, Speed reads, Research Brief, Muslim giving","
Civic engagement – including volunteering and registering to vote – rather than religiosity was more correlated with giving by Muslim American women, according to research we conducted with our colleagues at the Muslim Philanthropy Initiative.
All Muslims are supposed to contribute zakat, an obligatory form of giving. To meet this obligation, Muslims are required to give 2.5% of their surplus wealth to charities every year.
We found that 87% of all zakat given by Muslim American women came from registered voters. This is higher than the share of Muslim American women who are even eligible to vote, which a 2017 survey determined was 82%.
We also found that Muslim women who are registered to vote are 15 times more likely to volunteer than other Muslim women. And we determined that about 61% of the Muslim American women who said they volunteered gave nearly 94% of the total zakat contributions the participants in this study said they made in 2022.





The initiative, which is housed at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, also found that the top three motives for U.S.-based Muslim women to give to charity or engage in other forms of generous behavior are having compassion toward people in need, feeling that their gift can make a difference, and believing that it is part of their religious duty.  
The data for this study was collected by Social Science Research Solutions, a private firm that specializes in survey research in the United States. It recruited 3,355 adults to participate in the survey between February and April 2023 that included a representative sample of Muslim American women.
Why it matters
Our findings indicate that nonprofits eligible to receive zakat funds, but do not engage with Muslim American women, are losing out of valuable financial and volunteer resources for their mission.
This study adds to previous findings about how volunteering, giving and civic participation are positively correlated. We believe it is important for nonprofit leaders to cultivate strong relationships with their volunteers as part of their fundraising strategy.
What’s next
The Muslim Philanthropy Initiative is now conducting additional research through surveys and focus groups to get a more complete picture of how Muslim women give to charity and volunteer. In this next stage, we are seeking to identify the causes that Muslim women support the most through their charitable giving and volunteering.
The Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.

6 ways to foster political discourse on college campuses,https://theconversation.com/6-ways-to-foster-political-discourse-on-college-campuses-230365,3016051,"Politics, US higher education, College students, Dialogue, Political divide, Higher ed attainment, Political dialogue","
With deep divisions on college campuses – most recently over the conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel – many observers fear that universities are not places where students can discuss divisive issues with people who disagree with them. In my research and teaching, I have seen that students in fact want to have difficult conversations across divides, but they need support from faculty and other facilitators in order for these discussions to go well. 
Since early 2017, I have been observing events on college campuses in which students are brought together with peers with whom they disagree to talk about politics. In these sessions, facilitators provide students with guiding questions that help them to understand their peers’ political views. 
I conducted follow-up interviews with students a few weeks afterward and, when possible, three years later.
My aim is to understand what happens in these conversations. I want to know: Who learns what from whom? Who feels satisfied or frustrated, and why? And what does this all portend for America’s democracy?





The conversations I observed have taught me that six practices help to support a better experience for all students.
1. Set norms and expectations
When people talk about setting norms for conversation, they usually assume it is an effort to mandate speech rules. But norm-setting accomplishes something better than rule-following: It allows students to become sensitive to their own and others’ hopes and fears for the conversation. 
In my experience, opening the session with questions such as “What do you most hope will happen in this conversation?” “What worries you most about the conversation?” “What are you willing to give to it?” and “What do you hope to get from it?” can show students that they already share more than they anticipate. 
Moreover, this discussion leads naturally into the question of “How can we interact in a way that is most likely to realize our aims?” Students typically volunteer their own guidelines, such as assuming good faith, objecting to a person’s idea rather than attacking the person, honestly conveying when and why they feel hurt, and listening generously.
2. Allow students to tell their personal stories
Beginning with students’ personal stories lowers the barriers to entry, so that students who are not experts on politics can contribute. It allows students to feel heard about their direct experience. And it allows for what I have found to be the most profound outcome of dialogue: the shifts in how students feel about each other.  
For example, consider the “Can We Talk” campus dialogue series, which brings together ideologically diverse students for two-hour sessions in which facilitators provide a series of questions for students to ask each other. The sessions began with questions such as, “How were politics discussed in the home in which you were raised?” and “What is your earliest political memory?” before moving on to questions about students’ substantive views on relevant issues.
The focus of these sessions, which I observed in the 2017-2018 academic year at colleges throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is on cultivating students’ understanding of each other’s views and how they came to be.

If the dialogue is intended to focus on a specific issue, such as gun control, abortion or the war in Israel and Gaza, questions can be geared accordingly, such as “When did you first learn about this issue?” “How did it affect you at the time?” or “What about this issue draws you to this conversation?” 
3. Encourage curiosity
Students are often afraid that they will end up validating views they oppose unless they try to discredit those views. But in follow-up interviews I conducted three years after  their participation in a dialogue session,  I found that those students who did eventually change their political views were prompted to do so through sincere and nonthreatening questions. “I remember one girl asked me, ‘If you say you believe this, then why did you vote like that?’ I’ve been asking myself that question ever since,” admitted one student, whose politics changed considerably in the years between our first and second interviews. It mattered most that she felt questioned, not attacked. 
Questions can be encouraged throughout a conversation by reserving specific time for them in each round, as well as through directions such as “Think of one question you have always wanted to ask someone who thinks differently than you about this issue. Ask it now.” 
4. Dig into disagreement
One risk of emphasizing personal experience at the start is that students hesitate to dig into their disagreements. They want to be supportive, and it’s hard to argue with personal experience. In my research, though, I found that students ended up with the deepest respect for each other when they gained understanding of the nature of their disagreements.
Clarifying what is at stake in their differences allowed students to see that their opposition was not caused by ignorance, malice or madness on the other side, but legitimate contrasts in views of what is good and possible. 
After students have shared their views on issues and asked each other curiosity-oriented questions, they can be directed to ask each other questions such as “What is at the root of our disagreement?” and “What really matters to me, and to you, and is it the same thing? To the extent that it is not, why not?” 

5. Collaborate on next steps
Students tend to feel most satisfied when they can work toward a more concrete aim. Most ambitiously, this can involve real cooperative projects.
For example, the Sorenson Institute,  a political leadership institute at the University of Virginia, convenes dialogues that conclude with students putting together a proposal for the Virginia state Legislature on a specific topic such as gun control.
Even one-off conversations can conclude with what students might do differently on social media, on their campuses and in their families. When I followed up with them, I learned that many students had enacted these changes and found that people changed their own behavior in response. One student found that her uncle started reading and thinking about the articles she would send him. Another student discovered that peers in her political science class who had been dismissive of her in the past became respectful when she expressed her views and seemed to attend to them more sincerely.
6. Debrief
Some students will flourish in these conversations, while others will struggle. In my research, I found that students whose rights are threatened by policy proposals of the other side understandably experience the most difficulty. However, these same students’ experiences can be improved by debriefing with a trusted mentor afterward.
For example, one student who identifies as queer felt shaken after a discussion with peers who opposed her marriage rights. But meeting with a professor afterward helped her to feel empowered by the conversation, equipped with new knowledge to help her fight for a more just society. 
Listening to protest
Dialogue can deepen divides when it is presented as the only appropriate form of political communication, thereby silencing people who do not participate in these conversations. Students should be encouraged to also listen to messages conveyed through other means. For example, they can study protest movements – including ongoing, contemporary movements – and read the texts posted by activists who organize them.
It is important to convey to students that dialogue alone cannot solve all of what ails contemporary democracy. Protest, boycott and other forms of collective action matter, too.

"What Philadelphians need to know about the cityâs 7,000-camera surveillance system",https://theconversation.com/what-philadelphians-need-to-know-about-the-citys-7-000-camera-surveillance-system-230073,3016050,"Privacy, Surveillance, Video, Police, Technology, Facial recognition, Cameras, Philadelphia, Fourth Amendment, Local, CCTV cameras","
The Philadelphia Inquirer recently investigated Philadelphia’s use of what it described as a “little-scrutinized, 7,000-camera system that is exposing residents across the city to heightened surveillance with few rules or safeguards against abuse.” The article detailed how Philadelphia narcotics cops not only allegedly failed to disclose their use of video surveillance in arrest reports or to prosecutors, but also that the video footage at times proved officers were lying when they testified. 
The Conversation U.S. talked to Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and a practitioner-in-residence at NYU School of Law, about what these new video systems can do and the privacy and other issues they raise.
What can these cameras do?
The closed-circuit television, or CCTV, cameras most Americans pass each day may look interchangeable, but a lot has changed behind the lens in recent years. As video surveillance cameras have become cheaper and more ubiquitous, they have also grown more powerful – featuring increasingly high-definition images and the ability to pan, tilt and zoom. But the most significant change to cameras like those used in Philadelphia is the networks that police departments set up to aggregate these countless images of city residents’ daily lives.
A variety of AI tools can also harvest this data in new ways that some may find alarming.





Automated license plate reader software can both track drivers across the city in real time and create a long-term log of their cars’ movements. Want to know where a driver is now or was parked two years ago? Just check the database.
And pedestrians are no less prone to surveillance. Facial recognition software can scan images to automatically identify individuals and track them across the city.
How widespread is this technology?
According to the Inquirer’s investigation, Philadelphia’s camera network grew at an astounding pace. In the past decade, the city has gone from 216 cameras to a network of more than 7,000 cameras operated by police and transportation officials.
But those are just the cameras that city officials directly control and can access in real time.
In addition, police routinely turn to the images captured by private surveillance cameras. This includes everything from multimillion-dollar, internet-enabled camera systems at large stores, offices and universities to the individual cameras that homeowners or small-business owners screw into their door frames or exteriors. The public simply has no idea how many of these private cameras are in operation or how often their data is requested. 
How is this different from traditional police video surveillance?
Traditional cameras offered a narrow, grainy perspective on a single fixed place. These systems not only collected much less data than contemporary cameras, but they also retained far less.
A single CCTV camera at a bank might help police identify a suspect in a robbery, but it poses no privacy threat beyond that. It is confined to a small space where privacy concerns are minimal and security concerns are high. But mass camera deployments create a fundamentally different model, collecting far more information on all of us and creating far greater potential for misuse.
Police have attempted these techniques for decades, but the technology simply wasn’t up to the task. When the City of London Police deployed its so-called “ring of steel” security system in the 1990s, fewer than two dozen cameras tried to track the cars entering a tiny portion of the British capital, surveilling roughly a square kilometer of the city’s financial core. Officers manually jotted down vehicle plate numbers and surveilled drivers’ profile photos. 
The labor-intensive exercise was impossible to scale.
To deploy such a system across an entire city would likely have taken every police officer in the city and then some. Through automation, technology enables this mass surveillance by reducing the marginal cost of tracking, allowing police to expand monitoring far more broadly than would have been financially or pragmatically possible before.

What privacy concerns does it raise?
A single camera can capture our image; a citywide camera system can reconstruct our lives. Networked camera systems like those in Philadelphia, when combined with smartphones and other internet-enabled devices, allow officers to reconstruct an individual’s movements for days or weeks at a time, all without any court oversight. 
While it would take a warrant to install a GPS tracker on a resident’s car, police can recreate GPS-like location tracking without a warrant, all thanks to mass camera systems. And facial recognition in municipal cameras threatens the First Amendment, which protects freedom of speech, religion and peaceful assembly. The police are armed with a way to track nearly every person at a political protest, abortion clinic or house of worship. Such surveillance melts away the anonymity that is indispensable to an open society. 
Are there other risks or unintended consequences?
I believe giving thousands of city employees the keys to a small surveillance state is a recipe for disaster. 
The Philadelphia Inquirer found that the city has policies that forbid zooming in on residents for amusement, spying on someone by zooming in through their window, or blatant racial profiling. But what it didn’t find was evidence that these safeguards were being enforced.
When thousands of employees can spy on their neighbors, romantic partners and business rivals on a whim, it raises the question: Who watches the watchers? 
At least for now, the grim answer appears to be no one.

I want to keep my child safe from abuse â but research tells me Iâm doing it wrong,https://theconversation.com/i-want-to-keep-my-child-safe-from-abuse-but-research-tells-me-im-doing-it-wrong-227562,3016049,"Sexting, Child sexual abuse, Child sexual abuse prevention, Child safety","
Child sexual abuse is uncomfortable to think about, much less talk about. The idea of an adult engaging in sexual behaviors with a child feels sickening. It’s easiest to believe that it rarely happens, and when it does, that it’s only to children whose parents aren’t protecting them.
This belief stayed with me during my early days as a parent. I kept an eye out for creepy men at the playground and was skeptical of men who worked with young children, such as teachers and coaches. When my kids were old enough, I taught them what a “good touch” was, like a hug from a family member, and what a “bad touch” was, like someone touching their private parts.
But after nearly a quarter-century of conducting research – 15 years on family violence, another eight on child abuse prevention, including sexual abuse – I realized that many people, including me, were using antiquated strategies to protect our children. 
As the founder of the Center for Violence Prevention Research, I work with organizations that educate their communities and provide direct services to survivors of child sexual abuse. From them, I have learned much about the everyday actions all of us can take to help keep our children safe. Some of it may surprise you. 





Wrong assumptions
First, my view of what constitutes child sexual abuse was too narrow. Certainly, all sexual activities between adults and children are a form of abuse. 
But child sexual abuse also includes nonconsensual sexual contact between two children. It includes noncontact offenses such as sexual harassment, exhibitionism and using children to produce imagery of sexual abuse. Technology-based child sexual abuse is rising quickly with the rapid evolution of internet-based games, social media, and content generated by artificial intelligence. Reports to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children of online enticements increased 300% from 2021 to 2023.
My assumption that child sexual abuse didn’t happen in my community was wrong too. The latest data shows that at least 1 in 10 children, but likely closer to 1 in 5, experience sexual abuse. Statistically, that’s at least two children in my son’s kindergarten class. 
Child sexual abuse happens across all ethnoracial groups, socioeconomic statuses and all gender identities. Reports of female victims outnumber males, but male victimization is likely underreported because of stigma and cultural norms about masculinity.
I’ve learned that identifying the “creepy man” at the playground is not an effective strategy. At least 90% of child sexual abusers know their victims or the victims’ family prior to offending. Usually, the abuser is a trusted member of the community; sometimes, it’s a family member.
In other words, rather than search for a predator in the park, parents need to look at the circle of people they invite into their home. 
To be clear, abuse by strangers does happen, and teaching our kids to be wary of strangers is necessary. But it’s the exception, not the norm, for child sexual abuse offenses. 
Most of the time, it’s not even adults causing the harm. The latest data shows more than 70% of self-reported child sexual abuse is committed by other juveniles. Nearly 1 in 10 young people say they caused some type of sexual harm to another child. Their average age at the time of causing harm is between 14 and 16. 

Now for a bit of good news: The belief that people who sexually abuse children are innately evil is an oversimplification. In reality, only about 13% of adults and approximately 5% of adolescents who sexually harm children commit another sexual offense after five years. The recidivism rate is even lower for those who receive therapeutic help.
By contrast, approximately 44% of adults who commit a felony of any kind will commit another offense within a year of prison release.
What parents can do
The latest research says uncomfortable conversations are necessary to keep kids safe. Here are some recommended strategies:
Avoid confusing language. “Good touches” and “bad touches” are no longer appropriate descriptors of abuse. Harmful touches can feel physically good, rather than painful or “bad.” Abusers can also manipulate children to believe their touches are acts of love.  
The research shows that it’s better to talk to children about touches that are “OK” or “not OK,” based on who does the touching and where they touch. This dissipates the confusion of something being bad but feeling good. 
These conversations require clear identification of all body parts, from head and shoulders to penis and vagina. Using accurate anatomical labels teaches children that all body parts can be discussed openly with safe adults. Also, when children use accurate labels to disclose abuse, they are more likely to be understood and believed.

Encourage bodily autonomy. Telling my children that hugs from family members were universally good touches was also wrong. If children think they have to give hugs on demand, it conveys the message they do not have authority over their body. 
Instead, I watch when my child is asked for a hug at family gatherings – if he hesitates, I advocate for him. I tell family members that physical touch is not mandatory and explain why – something like: “He prefers a bit more personal space, and we’re working on teaching him that he can decide who touches him and when. He really likes to give high-fives to show affection.” A heads-up: Often, the adults are put off, at least initially. 
In my family, we also don’t allow the use of guilt to encourage affection. That includes phrases like: “You’ll make me sad if you don’t give me a hug.”  
Promote empowerment. Research on adult sexual offenders found the greatest deterrence to completing the act was a vocal child – one who expressed their desire to stop, or said they would tell others. 
Monitor your child’s social media. Multiple studies show that monitoring guards against sexting or viewing of pornography, both of which are risk factors for child sexual abuse. Monitoring can also reveal permissive or dangerous sexual attitudes the child might have.
Talk to the adults in your circle. Ask those watching your child how they plan to keep your child safe when in their care. Admittedly, this can be an awkward conversation. I might say, “Hey, I have a few questions that might sound weird, but I think they’re important for parents to ask. I’m sure my child will be safe with you, but I’m trying to talk about these things regularly, so this is good practice for me.” You may need to educate them on what the research shows.  
Ask your child’s school what they’re doing to educate students and staff about child sexual abuse. Many states require schools to provide prevention education; recent research suggests these programs help children protect themselves from sexual abuse. 
Talk to your child’s sports or activity organization. Ask what procedures are in place to keep children safe. This includes their screening and hiring practices, how they train and educate staff, and their guidelines for reporting abuse. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides a guide for organizations on keeping children safe.  
Rely on updated research. Finally, when searching online for information, look for research that’s relatively recent – dated within the past five years. These studies should be published in peer-reviewed journals. 
And then be prepared for a jolt. You may discover the conventional wisdom you’ve clung to all these years may be based on outdated – and even harmful – information.

Colorado takes a new â and likely more effective â approach to the housing crisis,https://theconversation.com/colorado-takes-a-new-and-likely-more-effective-approach-to-the-housing-crisis-230195,3016048,"Housing, Colorado, Construction, Gentrification, Homelessness, Legislation, Housing crisis, Local, Transit","
In recent years, Colorado has been a poster child for the U.S. housing crisis. Previously a relatively affordable state, it has seen home prices increase nearly sixfold over the past three decades, outstripping even Florida and California.
Once a problem confined to coastal cities, unaffordable housing has increasingly become an issue in the nation’s heartland. 
Like elsewhere, there’s no single reason why real estate has become so expensive in Colorado. Instead, there are several: Demand is rising among millennials, seniors are remaining in their houses longer, investors are buying second homes and short-term rentals, and housing construction has failed to keep up. Then there are supply-chain disruptions and labor shortages.
The result? Colorado has been experiencing declining population growth, increasing homelessness and hiring challenges for employers.





But new legislation may change that.
This year, Colorado’s General Assembly passed several laws that, from my perspective as an expert on real estate and land use, will make Colorado a national leader in expanding housing affordability. 
On May 13, 2024, Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill requiring local governments to plan and zone for more apartments and condominiums near transit stations. On the same day, the governor signed a law allowing accessory dwelling units – small apartments located on the same lot as a single-family house – to be constructed in large cities and towns. These bills followed others that eliminated minimum vehicle parking requirements for apartments and preempted local rules prohibiting people from living with roommates. These changes will make housing more affordable by allowing developers to build more – and more diverse – housing at a lower cost.
Even more legislation, including a bill that would give local governments a right to purchase existing homes in order to preserve affordability, will soon reach the governor’s desk. Each of these actions aims to hold down housing costs for developers and home seekers. 
Restricting new housing causes problems
To end the housing crisis, governments need to get rid of rules that prevent developers from building new homes.
For decades, economists have observed that restrictive zoning laws in some of the nation’s wealthiest cities are a major factor blocking new development.
Under the law of supply and demand, limiting housing supply increases housing prices. 
That doesn’t just mean it’s hard to buy a home in Boulder or Vail. Unaffordable housing in prosperous U.S. cities has far-reaching effects. It increases the household wealth gap between existing, higher-income homeowners and renters. It reduces workforce dynamism, as workers can’t afford to move to places where they might find better-paying, more productive jobs. This, in turn, hurts national economic growth. Unaffordable housing also aggravates racial inequity and accelerates gentrification and displacement in lower-income neighborhoods. 
The housing affordability crisis even makes climate change worse. As people seek cheaper housing farther from employment centers, their commutes produce more greenhouse gas emissions.

Colorado is addressing issues head-on
Colorado’s transit-oriented housing law is intended to address these issues. And, as my forthcoming research suggests, it may prove more effective than other states’ interventions to make housing more affordable.
Beginning with Oregon in 2019, several states attacked single-family zoning by overruling local zoning laws that only allow one detached home per parcel. Many cities have passed similar changes. 
Advocates herald these reforms, but eliminating single-family zoning has produced little new housing. 
Bolstered by my experience as a land-use lawyer, my research demonstrates some of the issues with well-intentioned single-family zoning reforms: It is too expensive and difficult to finance projects that add just one or two additional units to properties sporadically. What’s more, small projects like these don’t attract experienced developers.
Allowing higher-density housing, reducing development fees and speeding up permitting time frames will result in more homes being built more quickly, my research shows.
Colorado’s legislation does a better job of harnessing market forces. The state’s new transit-oriented development law requires 31 cities to plan and zone for housing at an average density of 40 dwelling units per acre within a half-mile of a fixed-rail transit station or high-frequency bus corridor. That’s roughly equivalent to a three- or four-story apartment building. 
It’s impossible to predict exactly how many new housing units this law will create. But the Denver region’s transit agency has 77 light-rail stations, and the law will force local governments to plan and zone for approximately 60,000 housing units around those stations alone. That number of units would help to close Colorado’s 101,000-unit housing shortage. And that’s not counting the units that will be allowed to be built along bus lines. 
The new law builds on experiments in Massachusetts and California, where state governments have begun to require towns to zone for and eliminate red tape on moderate-density housing near transit. However, Colorado’s law goes further by allowing much denser development, mirroring locally adopted and highly effective transit-oriented development laws in Minneapolis and Los Angeles. 
Colorado’s law hits a sweet spot for developers. Mid-rise projects are the most profitable type of new multi-family housing construction, according to the University of California Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation. That’s because they can be built with inexpensive materials such as wood and don’t require specialized building-safety components that go into high-rise construction.
Developers can spread costs in these projects across more units than in, say, a duplex or triplex. Under proper market conditions or with modest incentives, larger projects make it more feasible for developers to set aside affordable units for below-market-rate affordable prices if local governments require it.
By design, residents of these new homes will have easy access to public transit, which should ease Colorado’s air-quality issues and reduce its carbon footprint. As a result, a broad coalition of housing, transportation and environmental advocates supported the bill.
Colorado’s transit-oriented law also addresses a common argument against state intervention in land-use regulation. Opponents argue that state laws governing land use eat away at local communities’ right to govern themselves. 
Local control is political, if not legal, dogma in many states. Honoring Colorado’s strong home rule tradition, the transit-oriented development bill allows cities to determine where in their transit areas to permit multi-family housing. A town could spread the required units throughout its transit areas, for example, or concentrate them in a particular location. But they can’t opt out from building them in the first place.

Animals self-medicate with plants â behavior people have observed and emulated for millennia,https://theconversation.com/animals-self-medicate-with-plants-behavior-people-have-observed-and-emulated-for-millennia-229768,3016047,"Animals, Orangutan, Aristotle, Zoopharmacognosy, Animal behavior, Self-medication, Phytochemicals, Ancient world","
When a wild orangutan in Sumatra recently suffered a facial wound, apparently after fighting with another male, he did something that caught the attention of the scientists observing him.
The animal chewed the leaves of a liana vine – a plant not normally eaten by apes. Over several days, the orangutan carefully applied the juice to its wound, then covered it with a paste of chewed-up liana. The wound healed with only a faint scar. The tropical plant he selected has antibacterial and antioxidant properties and is known to alleviate pain, fever, bleeding and inflammation.
The striking story was picked up by media worldwide. In interviews and in their research paper, the scientists stated that this is “the first systematically documented case of active wound treatment by a wild animal” with a biologically active plant. The discovery will “provide new insights into the origins of human wound care.”

To me, the behavior of the orangutan sounded familiar. As a historian of ancient science who investigates what Greeks and Romans knew about plants and animals, I was reminded of similar cases reported by Aristotle, Pliny the Elder, Aelian and other naturalists from antiquity. A remarkable body of accounts from ancient to medieval times describes self-medication by many different animals. The animals used plants to treat illness, repel parasites, neutralize poisons and heal wounds. 





The term zoopharmacognosy – “animal medicine knowledge” – was invented in 1987. But as the Roman natural historian Pliny pointed out 2,000 years ago, many animals have made medical discoveries useful for humans. Indeed, a large number of medicinal plants used in modern drugs were first discovered by Indigenous peoples and past cultures who observed animals employing plants and emulated them.
What you can learn by watching animals
Some of the earliest written examples of animal self-medication appear in Aristotle’s “History of Animals” from the fourth century BCE, such as the well-known habit of dogs to eat grass when ill, probably for purging and deworming.
Aristotle also noted that after hibernation, bears seek wild garlic as their first food. It is rich in vitamin C, iron and magnesium, healthful nutrients after a long winter’s nap. The Latin name reflects this folk belief: Allium ursinum translates to “bear lily,” and the common name in many other languages refers to bears.

Pliny explained how the use of dittany, also known as wild oregano, to treat arrow wounds arose from watching wounded stags grazing on the herb. Aristotle and Dioscorides credited wild goats with the discovery. Vergil, Cicero, Plutarch, Solinus, Celsus and Galen claimed that dittany has the ability to expel an arrowhead and close the wound. Among dittany’s many known phytochemical properties are antiseptic, anti-inflammatory and coagulating effects.
According to Pliny, deer also knew an antidote for toxic plants: wild artichokes. The leaves relieve nausea and stomach cramps and protect the liver. To cure themselves of spider bites, Pliny wrote, deer ate crabs washed up on the beach, and sick goats did the same. Notably, crab shells contain chitosan, which boosts the immune system. 
When elephants accidentally swallowed chameleons hidden on green foliage, they ate olive leaves, a natural antibiotic to combat salmonella harbored by lizards. Pliny said ravens eat chameleons, but then ingest bay leaves to counter the lizards’ toxicity. Antibacterial bay leaves relieve diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress. Pliny noted that blackbirds, partridges, jays and pigeons also eat bay leaves for digestive problems.

Weasels were said to roll in the evergreen plant rue to counter wounds and snakebites. Fresh rue is toxic. Its medical value is unclear, but the dried plant is included in many traditional folk medicines. Swallows collect another toxic plant, celandine, to make a poultice for their chicks’ eyes. Snakes emerging from hibernation rub their eyes on fennel. Fennel bulbs contain compounds that promote tissue repair and immunity.
According to the naturalist Aelian, who lived in the third century BCE, the Egyptians traced much of their medical knowledge to the wisdom of animals. Aelian described elephants treating spear wounds with olive flowers and oil. He also mentioned storks, partridges and turtledoves crushing oregano leaves and applying the paste to wounds.
The study of animals’ remedies continued in the Middle Ages. An example from the 12th-century English compendium of animal lore, the Aberdeen Bestiary, tells of bears coating sores with mullein. Folk medicine prescribes this flowering plant to soothe pain and heal burns and wounds, thanks to its anti-inflammatory chemicals. 
Ibn al-Durayhim’s 14th-century manuscript “The Usefulness of Animals” reported that swallows healed nestlings’ eyes with turmeric, another anti-inflammatory. He also noted that wild goats chew and apply sphagnum moss to wounds, just as the Sumatran orangutan did with liana. Sphagnum moss dressings neutralize bacteria and combat infection.
Nature’s pharmacopoeia
Of course, these premodern observations were folk knowledge, not formal science. But the stories reveal long-term observation and imitation of diverse animal species self-doctoring with bioactive plants. Just as traditional Indigenous ethnobotany is leading to lifesaving drugs today, scientific testing of the ancient and medieval claims could lead to discoveries of new therapeutic plants. 
Animal self-medication has become a rapidly growing scientific discipline. Observers report observations of animals, from birds and rats to porcupines and chimpanzees, deliberately employing an impressive repertoire of medicinal substances. One surprising observation is that finches and sparrows collect cigarette butts. The nicotine kills mites in bird nests. Some veterinarians even allow ailing dogs, horses and other domestic animals to choose their own prescriptions by sniffing various botanical compounds.
Mysteries remain. No one knows how animals sense which plants cure sickness, heal wounds, repel parasites or otherwise promote health. Are they intentionally responding to particular health crises? And how is their knowledge transmitted? What we do know is that we humans have been learning healing secrets by watching animals self-medicate for millennia.

Eugen Sandow was the posterboy of physical culture: his 1904 visit to South Africa reinforced racist ideas,https://theconversation.com/eugen-sandow-was-the-posterboy-of-physical-culture-his-1904-visit-to-south-africa-reinforced-racist-ideas-230685,3015535,"Eugenics, Bodybuilding, British Empire, African history, South African history, British colonialism, South African War, Colonial Africa, physical culture","
Eugen Sandow was an internationally famous strongman. The German-born British showman (1867-1925) toured the world challenging other strongmen and staging displays of strength. He declared himself to be a physical culturist and became the face of the physical culture movement and a pioneer of bodybuilding. Historically, the term “physical culture” is associated with displays of strength, health and fitness.
On 25 May 1904 – 120 years ago – Sandow began a tour of colonial South Africa. He left in September for Mozambique where he gave two performances and then set sail for India, China and Japan. His South African visit marked a high point of colonial imperial display and was steeped in racism.

      How colonial history shaped bodies and sport at the edges of empire




Scholars have argued that Sandow, born Frederich Mueller, took his English name from the term “eugenics”. Eugenics is the flawed, racist “science” of genetic racial improvement that was also adopted during the Nazi era in Germany, in America and Great Britain. Sandow arrived in South Africa following the international shock of Britain’s difficulties during the long and expensive South African War against the Afrikaners (Boers). He supported British eugenic efforts to “improve” the English race.





Just a year before Sandow arrived in South Africa, the British Lions rugby team had visited the region in what was sometimes billed as a “tour of reconciliation” between England and the defeated Afrikaner nation. 

As he did in other places, Sandow left behind the seeds of a revival of the strongman cult in South Africa through his stage shows and writings. He had become the representation of what was understood to be the ideal, strong, white Englishman and many emulated him. 
But only one academic paper exists about Sandow’s charged visit to South Africa. My study of archival materials shows that the visit marked a (mostly invisible) web between pedagogy (teaching), entertainment and colonial prejudices. I argue that “Sandowism” was an unintended propaganda tool for British imperialism, with Sandow playing a part in laying a foundation for later discrimination in sport in the country. 
Sandow and the colonial project
Sandow’s shows marked a shift in the country’s physical culture entertainment industry. Any future would-be strongmen who depended on brute strength alone fell by the wayside after him. Sandow brought theatricality to these displays, as well as a belief in the health benefits of strongman culture. 
He fostered a new (white) audience for physical culture events. One newspaper
reported that his show was: 

A full house, composed principally of ladies and children. 

His performances were spectacular. Towards the end of his tour, another newspaper reported:

Sandow continues nightly to amaze, delight, and instruct the crowds by his graceful movements, his statuesque poses, and his Samson-like exhibitions of strength.

In South Africa he also wrote opinion pieces, directed at women, on subjects like skincare and corsets. (He believed that women should build their physiques instead of relying on corsets to strengthen their bodies.) In the US, women paid considerable sums for private interviews in his dressing room after his shows. 
Sandow’s South African visit drew attention to a new phenomenon – professional  physical culture entertainment (similar to what we see in staged strength and wrestling events on television today). The support Sandow received from the South African medical, educational and organised sport fraternity also helped popularise his visit.

His tour of South Africa was entwined with capitalism, nationalist politics, Edwardian sexuality, sport coaching and controversy. It was part of his venture to return to England with a troupe of performers from 30 different nations with which he intended to astonish audiences through physical culture displays.
Physical culture
Physical culture originated in the 1800s as a health and strength training movement. The study of physical culture, the foundation of body building and weightlifting, is extremely neglected in the global south. Yet, this field of study reveals much about how human beings use exercise, medicine and sport to shape their lives. 
Sandow’s physical culture programme conformed with beliefs promoted by sport scientists at the time, such as Dudley Sergent from Harvard University. They believed that women were best suited for sports like golf, horse-riding and tennis. 
Sandow’s influence in South Africa
A School of Physical Culture would open in Johannesburg in 1904, claiming to originate from Sandow, though he denied the claim. The same year, a newspaper advertisement offered the “Sandow system: Special classes for ladies only” conducted by a trained pupil of Sandow.
Before Sandow’s arrival, public displays by strongmen were not unknown in South African society. One example is that of Kupido Kok, a cousin of the Griqua leader, Adam Kok. His reported feats included snapping the thigh bone of an eland, lifting a large pot from a fire with his little finger and lifting a 5,000 pound wagon. However, his skills did not interest colonial societies, where whiteness mattered above all. This was reinforced in physical culture by displays like Sandow’s body – its whiteness emphasised on stage with powders and lighting. 

Yet, as my study outlines, Sandow’s influence would play a role in promoting body building and weightlifting among black South Africans. 
An early known account of a connection between Sandow and South Africa was when white South African-born strongman, author and business entrepreneur  Tromp van Diggelen visited his consulting rooms in 1897 in England. He remained inspired by Sandow for the rest of his life. During his lifetime, Van Diggelen was a popular figure in black South African communities and advertised his training programmes in the local black press. 
Van Diggelen also assisted the black South African weightlifter Ron Eland to travel to England to qualify for the Olympic Games in 1948. In turn, Eland was partly responsible for promoting the bodybuilding career of the black South African David Isaacs, who gained an international footprint.
Lost to history
Today, with the rise of scientific sports studies, physical culture has all but disappeared from public consciousness in Africa.  
At the time, though, Sandow claimed that physical culture had developed into an exact science and he even examined potential South African pupils medically. To date however, physical education, sport science and medical exercise historians have ignored Sandow’s influence on their field of study in South Africa.

Sadly, this means a loss of understanding of the historical roots of racism in weightlifting, bodybuilding and exercise medicine in the country.

Heavy water: how melting ice sheets and pumped groundwater can lower local sea levels âÂ and boost them elsewhere,https://theconversation.com/heavy-water-how-melting-ice-sheets-and-pumped-groundwater-can-lower-local-sea-levels-and-boost-them-elsewhere-229503,3015261,"Climate change, Gravity, Global warming, La Nina, Environment, Water cycle, Sea level rise, Ice sheets, Hydrology, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Imagine you’re standing near the edge of the Antarctic Ice Sheet, gazing out over the ocean, when the ice near you starts to melt very rapidly. A surge of meltwater flows into the ocean. Surprisingly, you watch the sea level fall – not rise. 
But why? When we think of sea level rise, we picture oceans rising uniformly. But the sea is not like a bucket of water. It is bumpy and uneven. Gravity plays a vital role. Water is heavy. And unlike rocks, this enormous mass moves easily. Ice melts, snow and rain falls, rivers run, water evaporates and forms clouds. When ice melts, its weight shifts from land to sea and back again. 
Our new research uses gravity-sensing satellites to track how changes in water storage on land can cause unexpected fluctuations in sea levels.
This century, rapid melting of ice sheets and mountain glaciers has raised overall global sea levels by around 1.5 millimetres a year. Melting ice has contributed 75% to the overall increase in ocean mass. The remaining 25% is due to changes in water storage on ice-free land areas. This includes changes in water captured in dams, water used by crops and vegetation as well as extraction of groundwater which then either evaporates or flows down rivers and eventually ends up in the oceans. 
Changes to local sea level aren’t just due to melting glaciers or ice sheets. Any change in water mass on land can do the same thing. During large floods, the land gets heavier, boosting its gravity and triggering temporary local sea level rise. During droughts, the land loses mass, gravity drops and local sea levels fall.
These short-term effects are in addition to the long-term increases in sea level caused by the melting of Greenland and Antarctica and the thermal expansion as the oceans warm due to climate change.

How does water exchange influence sea level?
Why would local sea level fall near the coast of Antarctica if the ice sheet melts? It’s all because of gravity. 
Think about the size of the Antarctic ice sheet, which covers the continent and the seas around it. It’s almost 5 kilometres high at its thickest point, and weighs a staggering 24 million billion tonnes. A mass this size exerts a gravitational pull on the ocean nearby, making sea levels higher than if it wasn’t there. But as the ice sheet melts, it loses mass, weakening the pull. As a result, the mass of the ocean is less attracted to the ice and nearby sea levels actually fall – while more distant sea levels rise. 
Water is constantly being exchanged between land and sea. This exchange – through rainfall, rivers and groundwater – changes sea levels further away, affecting coastlines far beyond the point of entry or extraction. These fluctuations in water levels follow a predictable pattern as Earth rotates.
What this means is that sea level rise is different from place to place and time to time, even as ice steadily melts from global warming.
If there’s a sudden change to water or ice storage, it can profoundly influence water flows in the ocean, determining where sea levels rise or fall. For instance, as the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets melt, the change to gravity actually leads to a fall in sea levels in the polar oceans, while sea level rises rapidly near the Equator. 
Our research has shown the pumping of groundwater in ice-free regions – the continents where most of us live – can, in places such as Kuwait City, nearly mask the anticipated rise in sea levels from ice sheet melting. But in places such as New York, far away from intense groundwater extraction in Asia, sea level rise is accelerated.

Of water and land
In ice-free regions, the local sea level is influenced by what happens to water on land, whether by changes in lakes and rivers, soil moisture during drought and floods, or over-extraction of groundwater. 
When La Niña arrives in eastern Australia or northern South America, this climate cycle often brings torrential rain, which can result in large-scale flooding, billions of dollars of damage, and loss of life. But La Niña can also tilt the gravitational balance towards the land. 
In 2010 and 2011, consecutive La Niña events dropped so much rain on land that global sea level fell about 5mm. In the triple La Niña from 2020 to 2023, the rain dump significantly slowed the rate of global sea level rise.
This reduces, albeit temporarily, the climate-driven rise in global sea level.
What about groundwater? In most of the world, the drive for development and population growth have driven ever greater demands for water. Regions of China and India have been extracting groundwater at a combined rate of around  37 billion tonnes a year, far exceeding natural replenishment rates. 
This over-extraction of groundwater has made a substantial contribution of ~1 mm per decade to overall sea level rise. But paradoxically, it has caused local sea levels to fall, as our industrious activities shift water mass from underground onto farms and then to the sea, via rivers. 
As groundwater is depleted, the land loses mass and its gravitational pull falls. So far, this has had a far more pronounced effect on local sea level than the rise resulting from distant melting ice.
Of course, the water has to go somewhere. Unsustainable groundwater use ends up causing sea levels to rise elsewhere, and adds to the overall increase from ice sheet and mountain glacier melt.

What does the future hold?
Our research points to one reason why some of us have not yet seen the full effects of global warming driving sea level rise – it’s been masked by groundwater extraction or climate cycles such as La Niña. 
Groundwater overuse has slowed in China due to policy changes, leading to roughly 21 billion tonnes of increased water in these regions since the policy changes took effect.
Perversely, this will see local sea level rise accelerate, as groundwater extraction no longer offsets the increase from melting ice sheets. But on distant coastlines, reduced groundwater pumping will cause sea level rise to slow. 
At present, in some places, groundwater use and other changes on land rivals the impact of ice-driven effects. The changes to water on our continents has been significantly affecting local sea levels. 
But these changes are temporary and limited in magnitude relative to the big one: accelerating melting of the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica.

The governmentâs cash splash aims to kickstart Australiaâs battery industry. Has it flipped the right switches?,https://theconversation.com/the-governments-cash-splash-aims-to-kickstart-australias-battery-industry-has-it-flipped-the-right-switches-230856,3015260,"Renewable energy, Energy, Energy storage, Manufacturing, Battery, Battery storage, electricity storage, Net zero emissions by 2050, Future Made in Australia Act, future made in australia","
Australia has a new National Battery Strategy, unveiled this week as a key part of the government’s
Future Made in Australia agenda. The vision is for this country to be making batteries with secure supply chains by 2035.
It makes perfect sense for Australia to pursue domestic battery manufacturing. 
Australia has all the ingredients needed to create a booming battery industry: abundant minerals, a strong resource sector, renewable energy resources, manufacturing know-how, trading partners and a skilled workforce. Now it’s time to get cooking. 
But building a thriving national battery supply chain and local manufacturing industry won’t happen overnight. While new money is important for any new industry, what’s been missing is overarching government co-ordination. Otherwise it could mean spending a lot of money to little effect.






Pouring new money into battery action
Last week’s federal budget contained plenty of new money for batteries:

$523.2 million for a “Battery Breakthrough” to help manufacturers build capability in crucial areas. They will be paid to focus on high-value battery products that align with Australia’s areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. 
$20.3 million for “Building Future Battery Capabilities” to develop skills and expertise through stronger national collaboration. This includes funding to deliver a supply chain navigator tool. There’s also a battery innovation and scale-up program, best practice guidelines and standards, and battery industry skills and training.
$5.6 million to deliver an “Australian Made Battery Precinct” in
partnership with the Queensland government. The plan is ultimately to invest up to $100 million in the precinct.
$1.7 billion for the Future Made in Australia Innovation Fund. It will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage development in priority sectors. This includes manufacturing clean energy technologies such as batteries. 


We need more energy storage
Electricity storage will be crucial for decarbonising the global energy sector. It also underpins emissions reductions across the wider economy by enabling other sectors such as transport and heavy industry to be electrified. 
Batteries cut costs for the dynamic electricity market and support the energy transition. Renewables remain the lowest-cost energy source in Australia.
There’s plenty of demand for batteries. We need more storage in our energy system right now.
Australia currently has 1.7 gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity. Our forecasts suggest we’ll need a whopping 14.9GW of storage by 2030, and 30.5GW by 2040. That’s on the lowest-cost pathway for Australia to play its part in limiting global warming to 1.5°C. 
This means Australia is importing batteries while our emerging battery industry develops.
With government support Australia can develop onshore battery manufacturing at scale. This will give Australia better access to clean technologies while making more use of mineral resources. Such a strategy is key to making best use of opportunities in the transition to a net-zero global economy.
However, the history of the automotive industry in Australia shows domestic industries face substantial global competition. The challenge ahead is developing the skilled battery manufacturing workforce to harness available mineral resources. 
Australia has strong university and private technology industry sectors, so we should be able to pull it all together. Building a skilled workforce creates social and economic benefits, and can be a source of national pride.

Other countries are looking to build their own battery industries too. However, Australia can leverage an enormous advantage in critical minerals and energy resources. By joining with trading partners, Australia can provide “green” minerals and batteries to the world.
There is also an opportunity to align with solar manufacturing and other high-tech industries, which will support Australia’s ambition to become a renewable superpower.
The National Battery Strategy can contribute to decarbonising and building a prosperous nation that offers secure work for Australians. Australia’s deployment of battery storage can help make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime green economy transformation. 
This will require co-ordination across governments and industry. Along with Future Made in Australia, there’s the National Reconstruction Fund and government support through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
The strategy unveiled yesterday is a solid step towards the nation achieving its energy storage goals. Importantly, too, it can help ensure Australia’s industrial and manufacturing heartlands remain competitive in a net-zero world.

Why a new ruling on the law of the sea and climate change matters for Australia and especially our island neighbours,https://theconversation.com/why-a-new-ruling-on-the-law-of-the-sea-and-climate-change-matters-for-australia-and-especially-our-island-neighbours-230682,3015259,"Climate change, International law, Tuvalu, Law of the sea, Marine pollution, convention on law of the sea, Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), small island nations","
The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has found countries are obliged to protect the oceans from climate change impacts under the law of the sea. 
The tribunal’s 21 judges issued a unanimous Advisory Opinion on Climate Change and International Law on May 21. It’s a landmark decision. For the first time an international court or tribunal has laid out the extent of state obligations to mitigate climate change under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 
These findings are significant because ocean and climate are fundamentally linked. The global ocean covers 72% of Earth’s surface and holds 98% of its water. The advisory opinion cited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2019 finding that the ocean had taken up 90% of the excess heat in the climate system.
This ruling is important for Australia, which has sovereign rights over an area of ocean – its maritime jurisdiction – almost 50% larger than its land area (excluding Antarctica). 





The ruling is vitally important for small island (but large ocean) states that are most threatened by climate change impacts on the oceans. 

A matter of survival for some states
Climate change impacts include ocean warming, coral bleaching, acidification and sea-level rise. These are existential threats for some island nations.
For example, Tuvalu in the South Pacific consists of nine low-lying atolls and 101 reef islands. Their combined land area is 26 square kilometres. Crucially, the average height above sea level is less than 3 metres. 
This vulnerability to rising sea levels is only part of the problem for Tuvalu. The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change compounds the threat. 
In 2015 Cyclone Pam created storm waves that displaced 45% of Tuvalu’s people. Loss and damage costs were estimated at US$10 million. That was more than a third of Tuvalu’s GDP at the time.
In response to these grave challenges, Antigua, Barbuda and Tuvalu founded the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS) in October 2021, on the eve of the COP26 UN climate conference. Members now include Palau, Niue, Vanuatu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis, and the Bahamas. 

Tribunal lays out specific obligations
A key finding was the tribunal’s recognition that greenhouse gas emissions constitute pollution of the marine environment under the convention. 
The tribunal also determined that parties to the convention have substantive, specific obligations to mitigate the impacts on the oceans resulting from their greenhouse gas emissions. This  applies to both the high seas and maritime areas under a state’s jurisdiction. These measures include laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution due to emissions from:

land-based sources
vessels flying their flag or under their registry
offshore activities such as oil and gas extraction. 

State parties must also take all measures needed to implement the international standards set by competent international organisations, including the  International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
States are required to act on the basis of best available science and international rules and standards. The tribunal underscored the relevance of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, with its goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, as the main international legal instruments to combat climate change. 
These obligations are recognised as being ones of conduct (to make all necessary efforts) rather than ones of result (ensuring harm does not occur).  The tribunal made it clear that the standard of due diligence  in relation to meeting these obligations is “stringent”.
The advisory opinion noted efforts to fulfil these obligations may vary with the means available to states. It acknowledged the principle of “common but differentiated responsibilities”, which has been developed under the climate regime. 
Law of the sea obligations to assist developing states, especially those vulnerable to climate change, were also highlighted. So too was the requirement to monitor and assess climate impacts and share information.
The tribunal emphasised the specific obligation on states to prevent emissions under their control from causing damage to the marine environment of other states. It pointed to specific convention obligations of co-operation and consultation between states or through international organisations. 
The tribunal recognised the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment was broad in scope. However, it stressed the specific obligations to protect and preserve rare and fragile ecosystem, the habitats of threatened or endangered species, and living marine resources threatened by climate change impacts.

Advisory opinions carry weight
While it’s an advisory opinion, the tribunal’s findings are authoritative. 
Previous advisory opinions have made important contributions to the law.  For example, the tribunal’s decisions on deep-seabed mining and illegal fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of states developed the concept of due diligence as a standard of care under the law of the sea.  
An advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice persuaded the UK to resume negotiations with Mauritius over the future return of the Chagos islands. It also enabled the tribunal to resolve a maritime boundary dispute between the Maldives and Mauritius.
This week’s advisory opinion underpins efforts by vulnerable developing states, including small island states, which have contributed the least to climate change, to hold the developed world to account. 
Under the law of the sea, states bear responsibility for failing to comply with obligations to prevent pollution and protect the marine environment. The tribunal has confirmed these obligations apply to climate change and ocean acidification. 
Its advisory opinion could open the door to future litigation of climate change issues related to the oceans, including through the convention’s compulsory dispute resolution mechanisms.

"As COVID cases rise again, what do I need to know about the new FLiRT variants?",https://theconversation.com/as-covid-cases-rise-again-what-do-i-need-to-know-about-the-new-flirt-variants-230423,3015258,"Public health, Pandemic, Health, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, Health in the news","
We’ve now been living with COVID for well over four years. Although there’s still much to learn about SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID) at least one thing seems clear: it’s here to stay.
From the original Wuhan variant, to Delta, to Omicron, and several others in between, the virus has continued to evolve.
New variants have driven repeated waves of infection and challenged doctors and scientists seeking to understand this changing virus’ behaviour.
Now, we are faced with a new group of variants, the so-called “FLiRT” variants, which appear to be contributing to a rising wave of COVID infections around Australia and elsewhere. So where have they come from, and are they cause for concern?






A descendant of Omicron
The FLiRT variants are a group of subvariants of JN.1 from the Omicron lineage.
JN.1 was detected in August 2023 and declared a variant of interest by the World Health Organization in December 2023. By early 2024, it had become the most dominant variant in Australia and much of the rest of the world, driving large waves of infections. 
As new variants emerge, scientists work hard to try to understand their potential impact. This includes sequencing their genes and assessing their potential to transmit, infect and cause disease. 
In late 2023 scientists detected a range of subvariants of JN.1 in wastewater in the United States. Since then, these JN.1 subvariants, including KP.1.1, KP.2 and KP.3, have popped up and become more common around the world. 
But why the name FLiRT? Sequencing of these subvariants revealed a number of new mutations in the virus’ spike protein, including F456L, V1104L and R346T. The name FLiRT was coined by combining the letters in these mutations.

The spike protein is a crucial protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 that gives the virus its spiky shape and which it uses to attach to our cells. Amino acids are the basic building blocks that combine together to form proteins and the spike protein is 1,273 amino acids long. 
The numbers refer to the location of the mutations in the spike protein, while the letters designate the amino acid mutation. So for example, F456L denotes a change from F (an amino acid called phenylalanine) to L (the amino acid leucine) at position 456. 
What do we know about FLiRT’s characteristics?
The regions of the spike protein where the mutations have been found are important for two main reasons. The first is antibody binding, which influences the degree to which the immune system can recognise and neutralise the virus. The second is virus binding to host cells, which is required to cause infection. 
These factors explain why some experts have suggested the FLiRT subvariants may be more transmissible than earlier COVID variants. 
There are also very early suggestions the FLiRT subvariants could evade immunity from prior infections and vaccination better than the parental JN.1 variant. However, this research is yet to be peer-reviewed (independently verified by other researchers).
In more positive news, there’s no evidence the FLiRT variants cause more severe disease than earlier variants. Still, that doesn’t mean catching a COVID infection driven by FLiRT is risk-free.
Overall though, it’s very early days in terms of published research on these new FLiRT subvariants. We will need peer-reviewed data to understand more about FLiRT’s characteristics.
The rise of FLiRT
In the US, FLiRT has overtaken the original JN.1 variant as the dominant strain. The latest data from the US suggests the original JN.1 is making up less than 16% of cases.
While the FLiRT subvariants were detected in Australia more recently, they appear to be gaining traction. For example, NSW Health data up to mid May showed the proportion of KP.2 and KP.3 samples was continuing to increase.

In other parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, the FLiRT subvariants are similarly on the rise.
In Australia, as temperatures continue to drop, and we head into the winter months, respiratory viruses commonly increase in circulation and case numbers peak. 
So it is anticipated that the number of COVID cases will rise. And with the FLiRT subvariants showing evidence of increased “fitness”, meaning they present a stronger challenge against our body’s immune defences, it’s possible they will soon take over as the dominant subvariants circulating in Australia. 
How can I stay protected?
As the FLiRT variants are descended from Omicron, the current booster on offer in Australia, against Omicron XBB.1.5, is likely to offer substantial protection. Although it’s not guaranteed to stop you becoming infected, COVID vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe disease. So if you’re eligible, consider getting a booster to protect yourself this winter.
SARS-CoV-2 is now an endemic virus meaning it will continue to circulate around the world. To do this, the virus mutates – usually only slightly – to survive.
The new FLiRT subvariants are excellent examples of this, where the virus mutates enough to continue to circulate and cause disease. So far there is no suggestion these subvariants are causing more severe illness. It’s more likely they will cause people to catch COVID yet again.
While the information we have at this stage doesn’t give us significant cause for concern about the FLiRT variants specifically, we are nonetheless facing rising COVID infections once more. And we know people who are older or vulnerable, for example due to medical conditions that compromise their immune system, continue to be at greater risk.

A rush on critical minerals is coming for our most remote and disadvantaged communities,https://theconversation.com/a-rush-on-critical-minerals-is-coming-for-our-most-remote-and-disadvantaged-communities-230768,3014971,"Australia, Mining, Energy, Environment, Remote communities, Indigenous Australians, First Nations people, Critical minerals, Future Made in Australia Act, Federal budget 2024","
The Australian mining industry was promised billions of dollars in last week’s federal budget to boost critical minerals such as lithium, copper and rare earth metals. This includes tax incentives, an innovation fund and money for Geoscience Australia to map these resources.
Local investment in critical minerals mining and processing also feeds into the new National Battery Strategy, announced this week. 
But despite all this funding, virtually nothing has been allocated to help local communities engage with new mining activities. There are social and economic risks and opportunities, all of which need to be considered. 
We mapped Australia’s critical minerals deposits against socio-economic data to identify the communities most at risk. Our study shows some of our most disadvantaged areas have the most abundant critical minerals. This means they are highly likely to come under pressure from mining activities. But they may also have more to gain. 






Why is the government supporting critical minerals?
Critical minerals include aluminium, cobalt, copper, graphite, lithium, nickel and rare earth elements. 
We need much more of these minerals to scale up renewable energy. Critical minerals are also used in defence, space, computing, telecommunications and transport. 
Australia is rich in these resources. Supporting the sector could stabilise global supply and boost the Australian economy.
The A$22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package includes support for “green metals” and $8.8 billion for critical minerals.
Prime Minister Anthony Albanese also promised to fast-track low-risk foreign investment to unlock new projects. 
The Albanese government has already announced support for two major critical minerals projects. This includes $400 million in new loans to Australian company Alpa HPA for a high-purity alumina processing facility in Gladstone, Queensland. It also includes conditional approval of $185 million to Renascor Resources to expedite the development of its Siviour Graphite Project in South Australia. 
Earlier announcements include $840 million in loans and grants for Arafura, a Gina Rinehart-backed rare-earth refinery in Western Australia.
The Minerals Council of Australia has welcomed the government’s strategy.

What’s the problem?
Mining more minerals at a greater rate will put some of Australia’s poorest and most remote communities under enormous pressure. 
Unless we understand how critical minerals mining will affect people in these locations, the strategy could drive social inequality rather than reduce it. Australia already struggles with inequality. We don’t want to make a bad situation worse. 
Our research shows Australia’s most disadvantaged areas have the highest number of critical minerals mines and mineral deposits. 
People in these areas live in smaller communities. They also have poorer school completion rates and lower levels of qualifications than their counterparts in capital cities. These areas are also home to a higher proportion of Indigenous people than elsewhere in the same states. 
We found 57.8% of critical minerals projects in areas where Indigenous peoples have a legally recognised right to negotiate. Including native title claims, these rights are available at 79.2% of these projects. 
Following the Future Made announcement, local communities and Land Councils began telling us all this new activity is adding to the pressure around consultation with mining companies. More applications for minerals exploration and mining projects means more community input is required. This should include careful consideration of potential risks and impacts. These processes are complex and take time to do well.
State and territory governments have promised to partner with local communities and First Nations people and share the benefits of critical minerals mining. But these commitments are not accompanied by any tangible support for research or for communities, or a clear strategy for avoiding negative impacts.

But doesn’t mining bring local benefits to remote areas?
Mining can create local jobs and business opportunities, but it can also cause harm. The downsides include land and water contamination, loss of biodiversity, destruction of cultural heritage and liabilities after mines cease production. Some of these impacts last for generations.
Our data shows that despite the promises made, remote communities and regions don’t always see the benefits from mining. 
Another challenge is many of these new mines are expected to be deeper, with lower cutoff grades, thereby producing more waste at the surface. 
Building complex mines in environmentally fragile or culturally sensitive areas, where people haven’t benefited from mining in previous decades, will be a huge challenge. 
Unless these issues are better acknowledged and addressed, opposition to mining is likely to increase. If critical minerals mining fails to proceed, economic gains will be lost and the transition to renewable energy becomes more difficult.
These issues need to be a central part of Australia’s future critical minerals strategy.

What can be done?
There is an opportunity to map and better understand the distribution of mining’s social and economic risks and potential benefits. Here are three ideas.
First, the federal and state governments could commit to a minimum spend of their critical minerals and energy research budgets for independent social science and public policy research. Given the large overlap with Indigenous peoples lands, this must include First Nations people.
Second, as critical minerals deposits are mapped, governments also need to explore any overlap with local social and economic issues. In our work, we overlaid critical minerals project data with Australian Bureau of Statistics data on social disadvantage, employment, household income and population characteristics, to highlight issues policymakers and industry need to consider. 
This kind of early and pre-emptive analysis, conducted before project approval applications are lodged, would put companies and communities in a better position. Together they can discuss how to protect local people and the environment – and equitably share benefits. 
Third, governments should support researchers to make these studies publicly available and engage local communities, media and civil society groups to discuss the results. Communities may also have questions of their own. This kind of open exchange would help to level the playing field in agreement negotiations and project approval processes – particularly when small communities are faced with multiple projects moving quickly. 
Mining is the backbone of the Australian economy. We can’t overlook social impacts and inequalities in the race to mine more critical minerals.

The British election is Labourâs to lose. What would the UKâAustralia relationship look like under Keir Starmer?,https://theconversation.com/the-british-election-is-labours-to-lose-what-would-the-uk-australia-relationship-look-like-under-keir-starmer-230775,3014915,"UK politics, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, AUKUS, 2024 UK election, World news","
Assuming a Labour win in the UK general election – always a risky assumption given Labour’s proclivity for snatching defeat from the jaws of victory – the “Global Britain” bombast emanating from the United Kingdom will cease. 
Good relations with Australia will continue, however, due to AUKUS, the Australia–UK free trade agreement and the diplomatic groundwork laid by governments of both major parties in Canberra and London.
In truth, the “Global Britain” rhetoric has already been quietly dropped. Developed during the UK’s protracted withdrawal from the European Union, the idea of repositioning the country as a world leader (for example in trade, security, vaccines and just about everything) was always too closely associated with the boosterism of former prime minister Boris Johnson and the record-breakingly brief premiership of Liz Truss to survive a switch to a more “sensible” form of government under Rishi Sunak.
However, the fundamentals of the Australia–UK relationship remain solid. There was a time when British and Australian ministers would meet, say how well the two countries got on, make jokes about cricket and then struggle to find anything meaningful to discuss. But times have changed.





The UK Conservative government actively courted a revived relationship with Australia even before Brexit. The UK’s withdrawal from the EU provided an opportunity for Australia to sign another free trade agreement – widely but quietly assumed to work in Australia’s favour – and do so while asserting what great mates the two countries are. AUKUS then put the relationship on a renewed strategic footing.
Labour’s path to victory
This brings us to the electoral geography of Labour’s chances of gaining the keys to 10 Downing Street. The submarine-building program of AUKUS is good for jobs in the north of England. Winning back working-class votes in the so-called “Red Wall” of northern English constituencies, after Labour’s disastrous showing in 2019, is central to Labour’s hopes of victory. 
Under Sir Keir Starmer, party leader since 2020, Labour has worked hard – too hard, some might say – to win back socially conservative voters who abandoned the party due to its equivocation on Brexit under the unpopular Jeremy Corbyn. 
In contrast to the left-wing Corbyn, Starmer has embraced the Union Jack, broken his silence on Brexit to quash hopes of the UK ever rejoining the EU, and rolled back pledges for green initiatives. 

This will no doubt cost Labour some support from progressive voters. Starmer’s handling of the party’s response to the conflict in Gaza has already lost some support among Muslim voters who typically vote Labour. Nevertheless, the electoral calculation is that progressives cannot bring themselves to vote for the Conservatives, so their vote can be banked. 
But people can choose not to vote at all in the UK, and many may decide to stay away on election day. This could depress the vote for both major parties.
The rise of minor parties
This leaves the door open for minor parties to have an outsized effect on July 4. 
The Conservatives may lose votes to their right and left. Socially conservative right-wing voters, energised by the anti-woke tactics of the evermore right-leaning Tories, can vote for Reform UK. 
This party is the successor to the radical populist UK Independence Party and the Brexit Party, both formerly led by Nigel Farage. At the previous election, Farage did the Tories a huge favour and declined to run candidates against Brexit-supporting Conservatives. With Brexit done, Farage’s successor at the head of Reform, Richard Tice, is unlikely to be so generous. 

On their left, the Conservatives may also lose support from moderate voters (those put off by their anti-woke tactics) in the so-called “Blue Wall” of usually Conservative-voting constituencies in the south of England. These people, if they vote at all, may vote for the centrist Liberal Democrats.
And in Scotland, the pro-independence Scottish National Party is having struggles of its own. It’s been in government since 2007 and is plagued by leadership problems. Its loss may well be Labour’s gain as it seeks to win back votes it lost to the SNP after the independence referendum in 2014.
New soundtrack for an old friendship
So, if Labour does get back into Downing Street there will be a change of mood music in the Australia–UK relationship. 
When the Conservatives were in power in London and the Coalition was in power in Canberra, the two governments saw eye-to-eye ideologically. There was talk in the media of the Anglosphere shaping international relations and even saving the West (from itself).
Assuming the current shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, stays in his post if Labour forms the next government, the UK will be much more focused on repairing relations with the EU in general and France in particular (see AUKUS) than directly focused on the Indo-Pacific. It may be the UK’s capabilities in this region have been overstated by the Conservative government.

Labour is far less enamoured with the supposed benefits of unfettered free trade than the “Global Britain” wing of the Conservative Party. Nonetheless, the UK–Australian free trade agreement is in place and here to stay.
All in all, it would take a lot to push Australia and the UK apart, although it’s happened in the past. The major threat to AUKUS will not be from a change of government in London, but from a different president in Washington. 
If Labour wins government on July 4, some of the inflated hopes for the Australia–UK relationship will recede. But the two countries will still be great mates, and the jokes about cricket will be back for another innings, just with a different captain.

"The Matildas and Socceroos are soaring, while participation is growing â but the A-League is missing its moment to shine",https://theconversation.com/the-matildas-and-socceroos-are-soaring-while-participation-is-growing-but-the-a-league-is-missing-its-moment-to-shine-230407,3014914,"Soccer, Sports, Socceroos, Women's sport, Streaming, sports participation, A-league, Matildas, Sport and Society","
This should be a golden age for Australian soccer. After all, the big picture is good: the Matildas are waltzing, the Socceroos are well supported and Australia was just awarded hosting rights to the 2026 Women’s Asian Cup.
Australia is still buzzing from the success of the amazing FIFA Women’s World Cup last year in Australia and New Zealand. In a phenomenon I dubbed “Matildanomics”, the huge crowds of 80,000 and more for the Matildas in the largest stadiums in the land contrasted with the 15,000 they achieved in a friendly against Brazil in Penrith just seven years ago. 
Football Australia was excited about the economic impact even before the World Cup kick-off. They anticipated at least A$400 million in total benefits, including 3,000 full-time jobs and 60,000 visitors to the country. 
Beyond tourism and broadcast rights, they were expecting a legacy of long-term economic and social impact.





In the men’s game, the Socceroos also performed admirably at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. It was an incredible sight to see masses of fans at Sydney’s Darling Harbour and Melbourne’s Federation Square watching the national team play.

Soccer is no doubt in great shape at the elite level in Australia. Things are also purring at grassroots levels. 
What about soccer participation?
Soccer has long been one of Australia’s dominant codes in terms of participation.



This is particularly so at junior levels, although it drops off as kids enter their teens. 
At the moment, at junior levels, participation levels for girls should receive a boost with 407,000 new participants expected by 2027. This is mainly thanks to “the Matildas effect” and Football Australia’s “Legacy23” strategy, which seeks to boost community infrastructure (such as soccer pitches, training facilities and change rooms) to meet surging demand.



With Australia’s national teams performing well, strong participation at the grassroots levels and individual athletes (such as Sam Kerr) and Spurs manager (Ange Postecoglou) having made a name on the world stage, it should be a sparkling era for soccer in this country. 
However, these achievements mask some problems for the game at home.
Record women’s crowds but the A-League is still struggling
A-League Women (ALW) attendances are still hardly Matildas-sized, averaging a touch more than 2,200 a match this season. But the 2024 campaign attracted 300,000 fans, which the APL says was the most attended season of any women’s sport in Australian history. 
This compares favourably to last year’s Super Netball competition (266,000 fans) and the latest AFL Women’s season (284,000).
But the bigger picture is that the A-League is in financial turmoil. Some of its clubs are in trouble too. 
The league’s governing body, the Australian Professional Leagues (APL), is trying to plug a $100 million funding hole and is planning to cut its funding to A-League clubs by 80%. 
Then there is the perrenial discusion as to why A-League attendances are falling, on average, since the league’s early days but they are still reasonable by world standards. 
Then there are issues with the A-League’s recent broadcast deal with Network 10 and Paramount, with production company Global Advance recently placed into voluntary administration. 
Many fans were also outraged by the A-League’s decision to “sell” the grand final to Sydney, with backlash forcing the league to abandon the deal with the NSW government. 
What to do at the national competition level below the A-League is also causing issues. Football Australia says a national second division competition for men’s clubs is going ahead, but there is a scramble for clubs that want to be included.
To top it all off, three male players have recently been charged in connection with alleged betting corruption. There has also been recent violence involving fans, players and even referees.

These are headlines the domestic game definitely doesn’t need at a time of financial fragility. 
Challenges converting opportunities into wins
Late last year, as the A-League Women’s season was set to kick off, former Socceroos and A-League coach Postecoglou warned Australia still lacked serious financial investment in the sport.

When you look at what the Matildas did at the World Cup: unbelievable. But you still won’t see an influx of resources to the game. You won’t, I guarantee it.

Asked about football in Australia again this week, before Tottenham’s friendly match at the MCG, Postecoglou said “I don’t think too much has changed”.
Another challenge for the A-League is the global nature of the sport. 
More often than not, Australia’s best talent heads offshore. Most of the star Matildas – like Kerr, Mary Fowler, Steph Catley and Ellie Carpenter – play in the United Kingdom or Europe, just as male players like Craig Johnston, Harry Kewell and Mark Viduka did before them. 
The domestic game can’t attract and keep homegrown talent, with notable exceptions like Sydney FC championship player and World Cup penalty hero Cortnee Vine.
And what about the fans? Is the global nature of “the world game” a mixed blessing? After all, some fans are more interested in how Liverpool or Barcelona are going than Western United or Melbourne City. 
Streaming and the digital revolution has changed viewing habits – supporters of overseas teams can watch their games easily, meaning fans in Australia don’t have to engage with the local leagues to get their soccer fix if they don’t want to. 
Some observers who love the game point to the need for domestic soccer to get its own house in order, as well as celebrating the global journey of our Matildas and Socceroos stars abroad. 
They also believe the sport doesn’t need to engage with “code wars” with other Australian sports. 
As leading sports journalist Michael Cain once told me:

We need to look after our own game at home at the local level, as well as on the big stage, and the beauty of Australia is that we coexist with other football codes. Infighting within the sport has always been the code’s Achilles heel. Maybe if soccer in Australia worried about cleaning up its own civil wars, it would never have to look left or right at rivals ever again.

"All surface, no substance. Kids will probably love Beings at ACMI. Pity about the rest of us",https://theconversation.com/all-surface-no-substance-kids-will-probably-love-beings-at-acmi-pity-about-the-rest-of-us-228279,3014896,"Animation, Visual art, Video art, ACMI, Visual art review, Visual art and design","
At this week’s launch of Beings by Universal Everything, ACMI board member Ian Forsyth noted that ACMI’s last exhibition, Marshmallow Laser Feast: Works of Nature, exceeded audience targets by 40–50%. This is an enormous success by any measure. It proves ACMI’s vision for its premiere exhibition space is working.
Exhibitions like Beings and Marshmallow Laser Feast are designed as fun-for-the-whole-family experiences. This assumption was supported by the reference to kindness as the core of creativity by Universal Everything collective member Joel Gethin Lewis, who spoke at the launch. Lewis went on to conjure the late anthropologist and activist David Graeber with the assertion that play and care were the only two sustainable activities developed by the human race. 
Let me say at the outset, kids will probably love it. It looks like the distilled essence of Pixar’s Monster’s Inc visual appeal. Essence is the wrong word though; to be honest this is more like pastiche. 
In the end, Beings is yet another example of spectacle being substituted for substance at great expense.





Beings and nothingness
Upon our arrival we are greeted by variously “skinned” bobbing 3D lumps. Skins are textures that wrap a 3D object like wood grain, dots, freckles etc. The bouncing forms of these lumps, reminiscent of the rubber hose period of American animation, occupy a white void, which appears to flow directly and seamlessly off the room’s architecture. 
The effect is of a digital trompe l’oeil accompanied by melodic snippets of voice that cycle in rounds to create a looping crowd noise. It’s reminiscent of the hypnotically polyphonous music of the Aka Pygmies.
Moving on, we encounter a passing parade of what look like virtual soundsuits by the visual artist Nick Cave. Technically, what we have is the recording of human movement transposed onto polymorphous 3D figures in various skins. 

Various points on the figures’ bodies are extruded into hair or tentacles, with virtual gravity and inertia acting on them to give them bounce and drag. But this is Drag minus the transgression. Drag and the carnivalesque are premised on the usurping of norms and the social moirés of the everyday, but this work hollows out these important traditions. 
Just as these 3D models have no interior, so, too, this work seems all surface; it is an effect at the service of nothing. 
In the next room along we are greeted by a much larger curving screen, which once again features the motif of the parade. One can’t help but think of voguing and Mardi Gras, but there is no life here. Granted, the real-time rendering is incredible: computer power and programming have come a long way. However, technology and indeed technique must be at the service of something. 

What we have here is the Muppets minus the spicy lurking threat of the monstrous.
The third room contains a milling crowd, a murmuration of men seen from above. Once again, I had the distinct impression of a lack of direction. The exhibition lacked the overarching skill of a writer, animateur, choreographer or director to put all this breathtaking tech at the service of something other than a generic cuteness.

Seeing a dancer in the subsequent space I felt the thrill of just such a possibility. My ideal version of the exhibition could certainly have been fulfilled by putting these walk cycles at the service of a choreographer (as in Chunky Move’s Mortal Engine of 2008). But this was one moment of transcendence for technology that was otherwise left soaking in its own demo loops.
Adjacent to the dancer was a vertical screen populated by hyper-feminised, hip-rolling robots, possibly riffing on Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s turn as L3-37 in the movie Solo. But these lacked Waller-Bridge’s arch sass, let alone the thrill of Lee Bowery, of which they also seemed a pale echo. 
Who is it for?
As I have said, this show is one for the kids and they will probably love it, including the interactive dimensions that allow their movement to be skinned by various fantastic creatures in real time. 
And, if it wasn’t clear to those invited to the launch that they were not the target audience, it was reinforced by Ian Forsyth’s stated distinction between “real people living in suburbs” and those present for the launch. Such a classist distinction is yet another example of the anti-intellectual tradition in Australia (yawn). 

But I am also troubled by this apparently either/or choice being made for a world-class institution. ACMI’s curatorial drive for broad appeal overlooks the possibility that the culture of cute can be critical and appealing.
In Beings we experience an automated (albeit virtuosic) system that reduces the explosive creative exuberance of camp and drag to an algorithm. In the process it becomes vacuous, despite its psychedelically cheerful enthusiasm.

Beings is at ACMI, Melbourne, until September 29.

What is a virtual emergency department? And when should you âvisitâ one?,https://theconversation.com/what-is-a-virtual-emergency-department-and-when-should-you-visit-one-228098,3014895,"Hospitals, Emergency departments, Health, Consumer health, Emergency medicine, Telehealth","
For many Australians the emergency department (ED) is the physical and emblematic front door to accessing urgent health-care services.
But health-care services are evolving rapidly to meet the population’s changing needs. In recent years, we’ve seen growing use of telephone, video, and online health services, including the national healthdirect helpline, 13YARN (a crisis support service for First Nations people), state-funded lines like 13 HEALTH, and bulk-billed telehealth services, which have helped millions of Australians to access health care on demand and from home.
The ED is similarly expanding into new telehealth models to improve access to emergency medical care. Virtual EDs allow people to access the expertise of a hospital ED through their phone, computer or tablet. 
All Australian states and the Northern Territory have some form of virtual ED at least in development, although not all of these services are available to the general public at this stage.





So what is a virtual ED, and when is it appropriate to consider using one?
How does a virtual ED work?
A virtual ED is set up to mirror the way you would enter the physical ED front door. First you provide some basic information to administration staff, then you are triaged by a nurse (this means they categorise the level of urgency of your case), then you see the ED doctor. Generally, this all takes place in a single video call.
In some instances, virtual ED clinicians may consult with other specialists such as neurologists, cardiologists or trauma experts to make clinical decisions.

A virtual ED is not suitable for managing medical emergencies which would require immediate resuscitation, or potentially serious chest pains, difficulty breathing or severe injuries. 
A virtual ED is best suited to conditions that require immediate attention but are not life-threatening. These could include wounds, sprains, respiratory illnesses, allergic reactions, rashes, bites, pain, infections, minor burns, children with fevers, gastroenteritis, vertigo, high blood pressure, and many more.
People with these sorts of conditions and concerns may not be able to get in to see a GP straight away and may feel they need emergency advice, care or treatment. 
When attending the ED, they can be subject to long wait times and delayed specialist attention because more serious cases are naturally prioritised. Attending a virtual ED may mean they’re seen by a doctor more quickly, and can begin any relevant treatment sooner.
From the perspective of the health-care system, virtual EDs are about redirecting unnecessary presentations away from physical EDs, helping them be ready to respond to emergencies. The virtual ED will not hesitate in directing callers to come into the physical ED if staff believe it is an emergency.
The doctor in the virtual ED may also direct the patient to a GP or other health professional, for example if their condition can’t be assessed visually, or if they need physical treatment.

The results so far
Virtual EDs have developed significantly over the past three years, predominantly driven by the COVID pandemic. We are now starting to slowly see assessments of these services.
A recent evaluation my colleagues and I did of Queensland’s Metro North Virtual ED found roughly 30% of calls were directed to the physical ED. This suggests 70% of the time, cases could be managed effectively by the virtual ED.
Preliminary data from a Victorian virtual ED indicates it curbed a similar rate of avoidable ED presentations – 72% of patients were successfully managed by the virtual ED alone. A study on the cost-effectiveness of another Victorian virtual ED suggested it has the potential to generate savings in health-care costs if it prevents physical ED visits. 
Only 1.2% of people assessed in Queensland’s Metro North Virtual ED required unexpected hospital admission within 48 hours of being “discharged” from the virtual ED. None of these cases were life-threatening. This indicates the virtual ED is very safe.
The service experienced an average growth rate of 65% each month over a two-year evaluation period, highlighting increasing demand and confidence in the service. Surveys suggested clinicians also view the virtual ED positively.

What now?
We need further research into patient outcomes and satisfaction, as well as the demographics of those using virtual EDs, and how these measures compare to the physical ED across different triage categories.
There are also challenges associated with virtual EDs, including around technology (connection and skills among patients and health professionals), training (for health professionals) and the importance of maintaining security and privacy.
Nonetheless, these services have the potential to reduce congestion in physical EDs, and offer greater convenience for patients.
Eligibility differs between different programs, so if you want to use a virtual ED, you may need to check you are eligible in your jurisdiction. Most virtual EDs can be accessed online, and some have direct phone numbers.

What OpenAIâs deal with News Corp means for journalism (and for you),https://theconversation.com/what-openais-deal-with-news-corp-means-for-journalism-and-for-you-230773,3014894,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Journalism, News Corporation, News, Society, News Corp, News Corp Australia, OpenAI, Media use, Artificial intelligence (AI) bias, ChatGPT, Artificial Intelligence ethics, Generative AI","
OpenAI, the makers of ChatGPT, and News Corp, the international media conglomerate, have signed a deal that will let OpenAI use and learn from News Corp’s content.
In practical terms, this means when a user asks ChatGPT a question, the results might be informed by previous reporting in News Corp outlets, including Australian mastheads such as The Australian and The Daily Telegraph. It’s unclear whether the agreement includes only editorial or also opinion content.
OpenAI has licensed News Corp content because generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a ravenous beast: it needs data to learn from and generate useful outputs in return. Its ability to do this is impacted by the size and quality of its training data.
But could the media be signing its own death warrant by sharing its journalism? Or do we all benefit from the wider availability of reliable information?





Work with AI, or fight it?
ChatGPT, OpenAI’s major service, has learned from consuming books, articles and publicly available web content. This includes online news articles from across the internet. 
However, there are unresolved questions over who owns the content. The New York Times, for example, is suing OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement. By inking deals with media companies, generative AI services like ChatGPT can ensure they stay clear of legal questions by paying to learn from their content.

The quality and provenance of the training data also matter and can lead to biases in what generative AI produces. So it is notable that while some news media organisations are trying to stop their content from being used, others, including Associated Press, are signing deals.
ChatGPT is a complex technical system. Just because some outlets opt in to licensing deals and others don’t won’t mean the technology will sound more like The Australian than The New York Times.
However, at a broader level, where ChatGPT gets its news content from may affect how it responds to questions about current events. 
Working out what sort of news content gets included from each publication may also have an impact on how ChatGPT answers queries. Opinion articles are often more sensationalist than straight news, for example, and sometimes do not accurately reflect current issues. 
Jobs on the chopping block?
It also remains to be seen how deals like these will affect the human labour of journalists and editors. 
On one hand, since generative AI needs more and better content to provide better answers, journalists and content creators will be needed to ensure there is ongoing training data for AI to learn from. 
On the other hand, it’s not clear how many journalists organisations like News Corp think are necessary to do that job as further cuts at the organisation are expected next week. 

At the same time, the ability for AI to “hallucinate,” or make things up, is well-known. The role of editors in fact-checking content, and critical thinking among those consuming content, is paramount. 
In all this, small and medium-sized players in the media landscape seem once more to be pushed to the side, as the big players battle for lucrative content deals while smaller organisations fight for scraps or are left hungry.
Proceeding with caution
These deals also raise questions about the role of ABC and SBS in a changing media environment. Australians pay for public service media through their taxes, but OpenAI is not rushing to do deals with these organisations. 
However, companies like OpenAI are gradually accepting the principle that producing quality news costs money and that they need to secure licences to use content. If they want to be consistent, there is strong case to be made that such companies should not just include public service media content in their models, but recompense these organisations in the process, much like Google and Meta organised deals with the ABC through the News Media Bargaining Code.

Where you get your news matters. More people may use AI services for news in the future, but right now it is an underwhelming source of reliable information. Signing content-sharing agreements with companies like News Corp may help improve the quality of answers and increase the relevance of ChatGPT outputs for Australian users. 
News Corp also doesn’t have journalists in every community, so supporting independent media in your local area can help you get quality information and prevent news deserts from increasing. 
At the end of the day, generative AI doesn’t always get it right (and often gets it wrong) so treat outputs with a healthy level of caution and compare results with those from reputable sources before using AI-generated content to make decisions.

Married at First Sight NZ pops the question: can the relaunch put a winning Kiwi spin on the global format?,https://theconversation.com/married-at-first-sight-nz-pops-the-question-can-the-relaunch-put-a-winning-kiwi-spin-on-the-global-format-230764,3014893,"New Zealand, Marriage, Reality TV, TV ratings, Romance, Screen, Married at First Sight, Newshub, Warner Bros Discovery","
Following the hugely successful recent season of Married At First Sight (MAFS) Australia, fans of the format – and the reality romance genre in general – will be wondering if the rebooted New Zealand version can live up to expectations.
The new season (the first New Zealand version since 2019) begins this Sunday on Three, with the trailer warning New Zealanders to “prepare for the chaos of love”. But viewers will also be preparing for something different, and uniquely local, from the show’s return after five years: a little less Aussie, a bit more Kiwi.
Getting that differentiation right within a licensed reality format is key to the success of MAFS. It must be faithful enough to the franchise to attract an established audience, but different enough to set it apart from other versions available in the same territory.
This tactic – sometimes dubbed “glocalisation” – is similar to recognising a McDonald’s restaurant in another country but seeing menu variations: there may be many regional versions of MAFS, but there is a unique ingredient to each one.






Hard realities
MAFS began as a Danish reality experiment in 2013. The format involves strangers paired by relationship experts, then meeting for the first time at the altar. Each season follows these newlyweds as they receive therapy and advice from an expert panel, with the goal being to remain “married” once the season ends.
The format immediately rolled out across Europe and beyond, with 24 licensed versions of the format so far, including in the United Kingdom, United States and South Africa.
One key regional variation involves whether these TV marriages are, in fact, legally binding. In the US they are, in Australia and New Zealand they are not. Various regional versions also feature different experts, who may be a clinical neuropsychologist, an anthropologist, a financial expert, a sex therapist or even a pastor.
The new season of MAFS NZ is launching in a turbulent TV and media culture. Three’s parent company, Warner Bros Discovery, is closing its Newshub division but has said it would “still create content and would continue to invest in high profile and popular shows like MAFS Australia and the Block Australia”.
The decision to continue with local and imported reality shows while axing a news service is perhaps unsurprising in a ratings-driven commercial industry. The most recent season of MAFS Australia outrated both Newshub’s and rival TVNZ’s main news bulletins.
But not all reality formats are created equal, as the recent cancellation of The Block NZ demonstrated. So the pressure is certainly on MAFS NZ to get it right.

Non-fiction soap opera
The first MAFS NZ season in 2017 was memorable for the success of couple Angel and Brett who went on to have a baby. But the season also featured only six couples, which allowed viewers to spend more time with each narrative thread, and invest in their success during and after the show.
In effect, the format is something like a non-fiction soap opera – right down to screening across consecutive nights (Sunday to Tuesday for the forthcoming season). Fans are drawn into the lives of “supercouples” who must defy the odds and work towards their happy ending.
It’s why Art and Matilda from the first season of The Bachelor NZ still feature in the news, from their engagement and marriage to having three children. Indeed, setting the bar so high at the outset might explain why it was necessary to tweak the format for the next season, “moving from lusty abs on horseback to a mysterious Casanova”.
Unfortunately, the third season of MAFS NZ was memorable for different reasons, when one groom was edited out for having faced domestic violence charges in the US. Similar issues have dogged other romance formats.
The importance of casting, then, is vital. Past seasons have made efforts to educate audiences on the dangers of toxic partners, alpha males and gaslighting. MAFS Australia panel expert John Aiken (who will also appear on MAFS NZ) maintains the show has “a huge duty of care, service and focus for [participants] before, during and after”.
Only this week, however, a former Australian contestant declared she was “struggling” and has entered a mental health retreat. There is even a movement in the US to unionise participants under the motto “Cast members are people, not live props”.

Capturing the Kiwi essence
Of all of the regional versions, MAFS Australia is best at generating scandalous drama in a reality romance setting. Previous seasons have seen participants manipulate, cheat and even swap partners.
Schadenfreude – taking pleasure in the misfortune of others – is encouraged. Viewers have permission to react along with those on screen, and to continue the conversation online, at work or with family – generally at the expense of the participants.
But having been a reality romance participant myself (on The Bachelor NZ in 2016), I have seen how the pressure to deliver bigger, better or more outrageous scenarios can result in a deficit of the show’s essential elements – romance and love.
International locations or edited narratives that play up scandal or infighting do not necessarily provide the things that make audiences fall for reality romance. 
If this season of MAFS NZ succeeds it will be by creating a uniquely local perspective on the format, one that reflects recognisably Kiwi characteristics: not too wholesome, not too mean, not too melodramatic.

How Narendra Modiâs cult of personality was formed by a powerful Hindu nationalist group with a dark history,https://theconversation.com/how-narendra-modis-cult-of-personality-was-formed-by-a-powerful-hindu-nationalist-group-with-a-dark-history-225280,3014868,"India, Narendra Modi, BJP, Hindu nationalism, Hindu-Muslim relations, RSS, India election 2024, India elections 2024","
Narendra Modi’s right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has resorted to religious polarisation as it tries to rally its Hindu nationalist base in India’s ongoing general election, which ends on June 1.
Just days after voting started last month, the leading opposition party accused Modi of using hate speech when he called Muslims “infiltrators” at a campaign rally. 
He also repeated a conspiracy theory that Muslims would someday outnumber India’s majority Hindu population by having more children. If the opposition Congress returns to power, he added:

[it] will gather all your wealth and distribute it among those who have more children.

The Congress party has made no such commitments. But this claim has been repeated by BJP politicians during the campaign and featured in a video on the party’s Instagram account.

Many argue Modi’s openly anti-Muslim speeches reflect a sense of nervousness about the opposition gaining traction in the election. But there is no denying the fact the BJP has successfully created a perception of invincibility around itself. Why has it long had such a powerful image despite widespread economic distress?
To understand this, we need to look a bit closer at the history of right-wing populism in India.

How Hindu society has been formed
In my research, I have studied the way the modern “Hindu nation” has been constructed. In my view, there is a three-layered pyramid underpinning Modi’s popularity. 
India’s centuries-old caste system serves as the base. This system survives on a principle of exclusion for the so-called lower castes and minorities. 

The second layer is the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the BJP. A Hindu nationalist paramilitary organisation, it was founded in 1925 as part of a movement to unite all Hindus. 
On the topmost tier is Modi’s personality cult. The social legitimacy of Modi’s government is drawn from the base upwards, while the commands for his political project come from the top down. 
The RSS plays an important role in this structure. It reinforces the cult of Modi by invoking Hindu scriptures and depicting him as the great redeemer of the Hindu religion. And the lower castes serve as the foot soldiers to do the RSS’s bidding.
Early influences of European fascism
The RSS was founded by upper-caste Hindus, led by a physician and Hindu nationalist, K.B. Hedgewar. While the stated aim was to strengthen Hindu values, Hedgewar consistently refused to participate in India’s freedom struggle against the British. 
In the 1930s, Hindu nationalist leaders repeatedly expressed their admiration for Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. The Hindu supremacist B.S. Moonje, Hedgewar’s mentor, even travelled to Italy in 1931 to meet Mussolini and members of a fascist youth organisation. Once back in India, Moonje wanted to militarise Hindu society using fascist models.
The RSS was never in agreement with Mahatma Gandhi’s efforts to reconcile the differences between Hindus and Muslims. In January 1948, an RSS member, Nathuram Godse, assassinated Gandhi. Although the organisation claimed Godse had quit before the shooting, the RSS was briefly banned by the government. 
Growing power in Gujarat
Since its early days, one of the remarkable qualities of the RSS has been its methodical approach to its long-term vision.
It began establishing “shakhas”, or cells, in Gujarat, the present-day BJP stronghold, in the early 1940s. Its membership tripled from around 20,000 to 60,000 from 1943–48.
In the 1960s, the leaders of these cells began to preach about the virtues of an aggressive form of masculinity among Hindu men and alleged atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindu women. According to historian Megha Kumar, this “ideal Hindu man” was implicitly encouraged to commit sexual violence against Muslim women. 
In December 1968, provocative speeches were given at a massive rally in Ahmedabad, presided over by M.S. Golwalkar, the second RSS chief, and attended by future Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the leader of the political party Bharatiya Jana Sangh, the predecessor of the BJP. The group recruited another 8,600 men in the next few months.

With resentment against the Muslims growing, violent riots broke out in September 1969, resulting in a large number of sexual assaults against Muslim women. Hundreds were killed. 
This hardline religious nationalism started shaping Modi’s worldview after he joined the RSS in Gujarat at the age of eight. Having remarkable skills as an organiser, he rose through the ranks. By 1987, Modi’s responsibility was to act as the bridge between the RSS and the BJP, then a new political party. 
Modi played key roles in facilitating roadshows to capitalise on Hindu-Muslim tensions, including a procession in 1990 in support of a new temple on the site of the historic 16th-century Babri Mosque. The mosque was destroyed by Hindu nationalists two years later. 

Once the BJP came to power in Gujarat in 1995, the state machinery began recruiting RSS sympathisers to important posts. Backed by the RSS, Modi became chief minister in 2001. 
This was followed by violent anti-Muslim riots in 2002, in which more than 1,000 people were killed. Modi was accused of complicity in abetting the riots, though a Supreme Court panel acquitted him later. He has denied accusations he failed to stop the rioting.
The BJP has not lost a Gujarat election since then.
The mass reach of the RSS today
Once considered a fringe group, the RSS and its ideology started to be accepted into mainstream Indian politics in the 1970s. 
The BJP, in particular, needed the massive network of RSS cadres to mobilise Hindu voters. Even BJP candidates get selected based on feedback from RSS workers at the grassroots level.
Since coming to national power in 2014, the BJP has ensured that vice chancellors and professors appointed to public universities and universities in BJP-ruled states have come from the RSS.
And the organisation has penetrated almost every aspect of Hindu society. It runs a vast network of around 12,000 schools across the country, with more than three million students. These schools promote Hindu majoritarian values. 
Textbooks are being revised at other schools with visible influence of the RSS. Darwin’s theory of evolution, a chapter on democracy and references to the 2002 Gujarat riots have been removed, for instance, as well as a chapter on the Mughals – the powerful Muslim dynasty that ruled India for three centuries.

Modi himself consults the RSS on important policy matters, too. When he presided over the inauguration of the controversial Ram Temple at the former Babri Mosque site in January, cricketing heroes and film actors shared the stage with RSS members.
In a surprise shift, however, the BJP has tried to distance itself from the RSS in recent weeks, suggesting that it doesn’t need it to win elections anymore. But it’s unlikely the party can do without the organisation’s network of grassroots workers.
The future of the world’s largest democracy seems to be in the firm hands of a group that believes it can establish a monolithic Hindu state. Only India’s multicultural ethos and secular traditions can stop this from happening.

We analysed 30 years of Australian media articles â and unearthed some glaring gaps in the coverage,https://theconversation.com/we-analysed-30-years-of-australian-media-articles-and-unearthed-some-glaring-gaps-in-the-coverage-223466,3014867,"Media, Australian media, media analysis, disadvantage and institutions series","
The news media play a vital role in shaping the public conversation and covering complex issues such as war, the economy, climate change and technology. 
Yet our new research has found the news media in Australia have failed to meet the news coverage needs of those often most affected by these issues. 
Our multidisciplinary team gathered by RMIT’s Innovation Catalyst used machine learning techniques to examine 114,739 articles on financial wellbeing (including personal and family finance) published since 1990. We unearthed new insights on how Australian media coverage leaves behind key groups – particularly women and those struggling financially – when covering society’s big issues.  
The findings, published this week, are detailed in a report focused on how the media has covered financial wellbeing.

      Australia is rich with religious diversity. So why are our newsrooms falling behind?




What we did
Data scientists working with the team at RMIT accessed the Dow Jones database of all news stories printed or published online in the Australian media in the past three decades. They employed a machine learning technique called topic modelling. 
This method groups articles into topics, which are then interpreted by subject matter experts from the research team. This approach allowed us to examine a much larger data set than human researchers could alone.  
We found the news media have consistently allowed their coverage to be dominated by male voices and high and middle income earners. 
Coverage has also tended to overlook a range of equity issues impacting women, financially disadvantaged people, and the environment. 

Financial coverage focused on high earners
Our team was particularly interested in how the media covered financial wellbeing. This includes people’s ability to manage day-to-day and future expenses, and to live free from financial stress. It also means having resilience to cope financially with life’s unexpected events.
Stable housing is one vital component of financial wellbeing. 
We found media coverage of household financial issues over the past 30 years has focused overwhelmingly on the needs of middle and upper income earners. Three topics tended to dominate Australia’s financial coverage: property, investment advice and retirement funds. 
General investing advice (on issues such as the stock markets, exchange traded funds or bonds) was the most dominant topic covered by the financial media articles we studied, until September 2016 when it was overtaken by property as the dominant topic.
Social services, welfare and financial services coverage made up a very small proportion of Australia’s financial journalism.  
Coverage of investment advice peaked at 140 articles in February 2013, constituting almost 45% of the total number of financial wellbeing articles we analysed from that month.
Coverage of retirement funds peaked at 72 articles per month in May 2015. That topic constituted almost 22% of the total number of financial wellbeing articles we analysed from that month. The top financial wellbeing topic for that month was investment advice (at 37%). 
Property articles peaked at almost 175 per month in May 2022, constituting almost 51% of all financial wellbeing articles we analysed for that month.
Our analysis also showed the media can play an important role in providing trusted information when trust in financial institutions is low.
As trust in financial institutions was eroded during the banking royal commission and financial services inquiries of the 2010s, the media stepped up their coverage of money matters to help people negotiate complex financial decision-making.  
But as we note in the report:

There is lots of room for the financial media to report more on the financial wellbeing of a greater range of people in our communities, not just women and gender minorities, but First Nations people, cultural and racial minorities, people with disabilities, and many others. The healthiest economies are those in which all citizens enjoy financial wellbeing, not just the wealthy.

Reporting on workplace gender equality in the context of financial wellbeing peaked at a meagre 13 articles in December 2017, according to our study.
And Australian media coverage has, over the past 30 years, largely missed the critical financial and social issues associated with financial abuse and family violence. However, this has started to change.

An intersection of issues
We presented our data to a roundtable of academics and community groups, which included Good Shepherd, Infoxchange and Brotherhood of St Laurence. The resulting discussion revealed an intersection between various topics not readily seen in general media coverage.    
For example, as lower income Australians struggle to afford insurance in areas affected by storms, floods and fire disasters (which have become more frequent and more severe as the climate changes), agencies and governments are increasingly called on to support people who have lost everything. Lower income people are disproportionately affected by natural disasters.
The rising costs of energy are making it harder (or, for some, impossible) to cool houses during heatwaves built to standards based on outdated temperatures. This means higher living costs and a more pronounced burden on the health system. This impact, however, is not generally felt by wealthier Australians, whose issues and interests are more often represented in the news media.  
This analysis showed issues such as financial wellbeing, media coverage and climate change do not exist in silos. They are interconnected. And the media has a role to play in promoting financial wellbeing for all, not just the already wealthy.

You leave a âmicrobe fingerprintâ on every piece of clothing you wear â and it could help forensic scientists solve crimes,https://theconversation.com/you-leave-a-microbe-fingerprint-on-every-piece-of-clothing-you-wear-and-it-could-help-forensic-scientists-solve-crimes-229203,3014823,"Bacteria, Criminology, Microbial forensics, Microbiology, Forensic science, Microbiome, DNA sequencing, Crime scene","
When you think of a criminal investigation, you might picture detectives meticulously collecting and analysing evidence found at the scene: weapons, biological fluids, footprints and fingerprints. However, this is just the beginning of an attempt to reconstruct the events and individuals involved in the crime. 
At the heart of the process lies the “principle of exchange” formulated by the French criminologist Edmond Locard in the early 1900s, which states that “every contact leaves a trace”. The transfer of materials between the parties involved in a crime (the victim, the perpetrator, objects, the environment) forms the basis for reconstructing the events. 
In Locard’s time, these traces were typically things you could see with a magnifying glass or microscope, such as pollen, sand and fibres. However, such evidence is limited because much of it is not directly associated with a specific individual. 
In our latest research, we have shown how the population of bacteria on a person’s skin leaves traces on the clothes they wear – and how these traces last for months and can be used to uniquely identify the wearer.





Microbial traces
Imagine a crime scene where an investigator finds a victim and a piece of clothing that doesn’t belong to them. Pollen or grains of sand might help the investigator find out where it came from, but what about identifying the owner of the clothing?
Skin cells, hairs and biological fluids are good contenders. However, another thing very specific to an individual is the unique community of microorganisms on and within their body. 
These microbes are specific to different parts of the body, can persist over long periods of time and can be transferred to other people and to the environment.  This makes them useful to address a variety of questions in forensics. 
“Forensic microbiology” got its start in the early 2000s, as scientists set out to find ways to defend against bioterrorism. Today forensic microbiology is used to identify individuals after death, understand what their health was like before they died, determine how and why people have died, how long it has been since they died, and where they came from.
In a nutshell, today’s update on Locard’s principle is that “every contact leaves a microbiological trace”. 
The ‘touch microbiome’
While this principle has been established, we still want to know more about how much of an individual’s microbiome is transferred to their surroundings. We also need to know how long it persists, and whether certain microbes may be more useful than others for identification. 
We also want to understand how microbial traces may be contaminated by other items or the environment, and how different receiving surfaces affect microbial populations.
In 2021, two of the authors (Procopio and Gino) and colleagues at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK and the University of Eastern Piedmont in Italy first described  the “touch microbiome” – the unique bacterial populations on individuals’ skin. This work also studied how these bacteria could be transferred and persist for up to a month on non-porous surfaces, such as a glass slide, in uncontrolled indoor surroundings.
This team also analysed DNA from samples belonging to dead bodies from old cases, which had been frozen for up to 16 years. They were able to identify specific populations of microbes linked to the manner of death and the decomposition stage of the bodies. This showed the microbial signature can be used to improve our understanding of cold cases when DNA extracts are still available. 
Tracing T-shirts
In our most recent work, the third author (Magni) joined the collaboration to improve the potential of individual identification from clothes, items often collected as evidence at the crime scene.
In our study, cotton T-shirts were worn by two individuals for 24 hours in Australia. The T-shirts were then placed in a controlled environment for up to six months, alongside unworn items used as controls. Samples from both worn and unworn T-shirts were taken at various points in time and frozen.
The samples were then shipped (still frozen) to Italy for microbial DNA extraction. Next, sequencing was conducted in the UK, with the goal of identifying the microbial species present in the samples.
Results showed the two volunteers transferred distinct and recognisable microbes onto the clothing, each unique to the respective individual. Additionally, we could distinguish between worn and unworn items even after an extended period of time. The microbiome remained stable on the worn garments for up to 180 days. 
We also observed the transfer of specific bacteria from the worn items to the unworn ones stored closest to them, showing the possibility of microbe transfer between items.
Learning more from clothes
Clothes at any crime scene can provide key evidence for the investigation process. 
They can aid in profiling individuals by revealing indicators of gender, occupation, income, social status, political, religious or cultural affiliations, and even marital status.
Additionally, they can provide clues regarding the manner of death, the location of the crime, and in certain cases, even support the estimation of the time since death. 
Clothes play a crucial role in reconstructing events associated with the crime and establishing the identity of individuals involved. 
Our research shows clothing can provide even more evidence. The discovery of unique microbiomes capable of identifying individuals from clothing marks a significant stride forward.

Vaping in schools: Ontarioâs $30 million for surveillance and security wonât address student needs,https://theconversation.com/vaping-in-schools-ontarios-30-million-for-surveillance-and-security-wont-address-student-needs-229072,3014763,"High school, E-cigarettes, Vaping, High school students, student privacy, Student data, Ontario, EdTech","
Ontario’s recent education budget announced a “back to basics” funding formula, which includes $30 million to install vape detectors and security upgrades — measures which will expand the surveillance of students in schools. 
The province says the budget signals a huge investment in education, but the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives notes it cumulatively reflects funds for 4,900 fewer educators in classrooms. The Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation says there’s a cut to funding per student by almost 10 per cent since 2018.
The province’s security investments are fear-driven responses to a real problem: Statistics Canada explains that “vaping to reduce stress has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic for those aged 15 to 19, and was reported as the main reason for vaping within this age group.”
Detectors and other surveillance technologies fail to address the stressors students are coping with, particularly those most vulnerable to systemic neglect. Rationale for their efficacy is also unclear. 






Detector projects moving ahead
Days after Ontario’s announcement, a news report detailed the recent installation of vape detectors in six Peel District high schools. Located in student washrooms, these detectors also capture loud noises that are reviewed by staff in real time. 
The Toronto District School Board has also appealed for funding to install detectors.
A May 5 Toronto Star headlined “This school board installed vaping detectors to help kids break the habit. Here’s how its experiment worked — and what other schools can learn from it” reports on a a pilot project in a North Bay school.
Beyond the headline
While the Star headline suggests that detectors were central to addressing vaping, beyond the headline, the story details how the project was part of a comprehensive whole-school approach  involving education including assemblies for students, information sessions for staff and in-class lessons.
The inclusion of vape detectors as part of a comprehensive response also echoes the marketing material of corporations selling vape detectors. 
The Minister of Education has tweeted media coverage about the North Bay pilot project to rationalize funding more surveillance technology.
Other media headlines have amplified the idea that vape detectors are the key for success in addressing vaping at school.

Privacy issues
Could schools replicate the success of a pilot project in one North Bay school without the surveillance technology of vape detectors? They have a responsibility to try. 
Privacy concerns include a lack of transparency with respect to how student data is collected, handled, and used. Detectors used in North Bay and elsewhere, for example, are wireless, and send a notification on an app to the phone of a school staff member to alert them, when activated. Some detectors may offer the option to capture noise.
The use of vape detectors is not limited to Ontario. In Fredericton, New Brunswick, they are also in use.  
In a CBC interview, the Director of Schools for the Fredericton Education Centre says their detectors can detect THC, cannabis and loud noises that indicate vandalism. In response to possible privacy concerns, she explained it’s “a system that people have had to get used to over time.”
Ann Cavoukian, former Ontario Privacy Commissioner, warned about the potential for these technologies to dramatically expand.
What are we getting used to?
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published a recent report “Digital Dystopia: The Danger in Buying What the EdTech Industry is Selling.” The report did not examine vape detectors specifically, but instead evaluated leading products by EdTech surveillance companies; at least one company listed in the report also produces vape detectors. Others offer “aggression detectors,” triggered by sound.   
According to the report, companies that sell so-called solutions to school boards, driven by a US$3.8 billion-a-year surveillance industry, promote their products “as a highly effective intervention to keep students safe; ""however, there is no independent, unbiased, data-driven evidence that they do so.” Report authors concluded the harms of EdTech surveillance tools outweighed perceived benefits.
The ACLU explains surveillance technology:

normalizes conduct that contravenes the privacy rights of students, including the right to live free from surveillance; 
erodes trust in adults entrusted to care for them; 
inhibits the development of self-advocacy; 
and increases fear and criminalizes youth through the disciplinary mechanisms used to respond to surveillance.

The report shows surveillance technology harms all students. It harms vulnerable students disproportionately, particularly 2SLGBTQ+, low-income, undocumented, Black, Indigenous, and racialized students and students with disabilities. 

Student centred solutions needed
What we don’t fund, we police. It is no coincidence that under a chronically under-funded education system, in a context of deteriorating public supports, we are turning toward intrusive technologies to contain and control the social pain of young people. 
As the ACLU outlines, using surveillance technology draws financial and human resources away from effective responses to concerns about safety that centre the dignity and rights of students. And, there are also harms that impact students already vulnerable in the system, including disproportionate exposure to surveillance, discipline and punishment.
Reform needed
Following the announcement of funding for surveillance technology, Ontario  announced it intends to introduce legislation to protect children’s privacy and data. While the headline is promising, details are sparse. We need regulatory changes, but changes should not be driven by industry experts with corporate interests nor by police — and safety shouldn’t include expanding ineffective surveillance technology. 
As data science researcher Amy Farrow noted, “industry choices have extensive control over student information protection.” Farrow offers policy recommendations that include:

creating a commission that maintains a panel of experts and representatives within the Ontario Ministry of Education dedicated to protecting students’ information;

identifying and reviewing commonly used applications and platforms; 
identifying standards and enacting regulations consistent with privacy and data protection legislation, informed by expert bodies.

We have a responsibility to critically interrogate claims of efficacy by EdTech surveillance companies that offer technological solutions to complex social problems — especially when young people are bearing the weight of its harms.

These tips can help keep you safe during a potentially severe 2024 wildfire season,https://theconversation.com/these-tips-can-help-keep-you-safe-during-a-potentially-severe-2024-wildfire-season-230637,3014762,"Canada, Smoke, Wood smoke, British Columbia, Alberta, Forest fires, Wildfires, Fire season, respiratory health","
The 2023 wildfire season was Canada’s worst on record. 
High temperatures and widespread drought fuelled over 6,600 fires, burning a record-breaking 18.4 million hectares, an area more than double the size of New Brunswick. The fires emitted nearly 480 million tonnes of carbon, five times the emissions of an average season, turning the skies hazy and orange and blanketing much of North America in wildfire smoke for weeks. 
Many regions of Canada experienced over 40 days where air pollution concentrations exceeded the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines, leading to periods where Canada had some of the worst air quality in the world.
With 2023 behind us the question now is: will 2024 be as bad?





Heading into the 2024 wildfire season
Many of the fires in northern regions continued to burn throughout the winter. These fires, known as “holdover” fires, along with Canada’s warmest winter on record and extreme drought in many regions, fuelled an early start to the 2024 wildfire season. 

This year, as of May 22, 2024, there have already been over 1,200 fires, burning nearly 400,000 hectares and causing multiple evacuation orders in northern British Columbia. Smoke from the fires near Fort Nelson triggered air quality alerts across Alberta and the Midwestern United States. 
Most of Canada is forecasted to have above average “fire weather” conditions — hot, dry and windy — throughout the summer, due in large part to the low snow levels, ongoing dry conditions and above average temperatures. 
Simply put, these early season fires and current weather conditions indicate that Canada may be on track for another severe wildfire season.
How wildfire smoke affects our health
Wildfire smoke can travel thousands of kilometres, exposing communities both near and far to extremely high air pollution concentrations. 
Wildfire smoke is a complex mixture of very small particles and other hazardous pollutants that can be inhaled into the deepest parts of the lungs. Once inhaled, these particles can trigger systemic inflammation and cause or exacerbate existing respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, increasing the risk of hospitalization and death.

Emerging evidence indicates that wildfire smoke may affect our brains, increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes and have long-term health implications. There is no safe level of wildfire smoke exposure, and even very low concentrations can pose a risk.
Strategies to prepare for a summer of wildfire smoke
As Canada faces the potential of another severe wildfire season, it is important to be prepared for prolonged and intense periods of wildfire smoke. 
Planning ahead can equip you with the knowledge and resources you need to effectively mitigate exposure and protect your — and your family’s — health on smoky days. Below are some strategies and tools you can use as we head into the 2024 wildfire season:
1 - Understand and plan for your personal risk 
Wildfire smoke does not affect everyone equally. Young children, older adults, pregnant people and individuals who live or work outdoors are more susceptible to smoke. 
People with chronic conditions, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes, also face an increased risk. If you have a chronic condition, talk to your doctor about how to manage your health on smoky days and make sure you have access to essential medications. 
Be sure to listen to your body when it’s smoky outside. Reduce your exposure if you feel unwell or have symptoms like coughing or throat irritation and seek medical attention for more severe symptoms such as shortness of breath or chest pain.

2 - Know how to check your local air quality and smoke forecasts 
Air quality can change rapidly during periods of wildfire smoke. Interactive maps like AirNow and PurpleAir allow you to easily check current air quality conditions using the Air Quality Index. Also pay attention to your local Air Quality Health Index. 
Smartphone apps like WeatherCAN and Smoke Sense can be used to check local conditions and set up custom air quality alerts. 
Air quality forecasts, such as FireSmoke and FireWork, can be useful for understanding when and where smoky conditions might occur over the next few days.
3 - Make sure you have access to clean indoor air 
Staying indoors is one of the best ways to reduce exposure. To keep the air in your home as clean as possible, close your windows and doors and — if you have one — set your forced air system to “recirculate mode.” 
Consider using a portable air cleaner with a HEPA filter, as they can significantly improve indoor air quality when it’s smoky outside. If purchasing an air cleaner, make sure to choose the right one for your space and use it properly. 
Do-it-yourself air cleaners are an affordable, equally effective alternative. Public spaces with good air filtration, such as libraries, malls and community centres, can also provide easy access to cleaner indoor air.

4 - If you need to go outdoors, know how to protect yourself 
When possible, minimize your time spent outdoors and reduce your activity levels. If your job requires you to work outdoors then check with your province or territory — and union if you are a member — for your rights to a safe work environment.
If you must venture outside, respirator masks (such as N95s) can significantly reduce exposure to the particles in smoke, so long as they fit properly. And if you need to drive, be sure to keep the windows shut and recirculate the air in your car — and be aware that running your car in heavy wildfire smoke can cause damage. 
As our world warms, we are all going to have to learn to live with increasingly frequent periods of intense wildfire smoke. While efforts to mitigate, and adapt to, global warming occur over the long term in the here and now, the best we can do is be aware, prepare for the worst and connect with our communities to build smoke resiliency.

Why the upcoming South African election is a massive milestone for the ruling ANC,https://theconversation.com/why-the-upcoming-south-african-election-is-a-massive-milestone-for-the-ruling-anc-230142,3014700,"South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, African National Congress (ANC), Give me perspective, South African elections 2024","
South African’s governing party, the African National Congress (ANC), is in trouble. After 30 years in charge, it is scrambling for support ahead of the upcoming national elections.
The ANC has run the country since the end of apartheid in 1994, initially with Nelson Mandela as its leader. Crumbling infrastructure,  particularly to do with electricity supply, a growing lack of employment opportunities, and the perception of elite corruption  have all eroded the promise and the early nobility of Mandela’s emergence on to the South African government stage.
Even the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has had his own brush with corruption accusations. He was cleared of these, but his track record as someone able to turn South Africa around and help it find its feet once again towards economic progress and fairer distribution, has been hampered by massive infrastructure disintegration. Huge electricity blackouts and unreliable transport have affected domestic voters as well as the huge industries that depend on energy and getting their products to the coast for export, which has constrained South Africa’s economic growth. 
So, given all of that, in the elections coming on May 29 it seems for the first time that the ANC could lose its parliamentary majority. This is of great importance in that it is parliament that elects the president and therefore both the party and the president could be ousted. It will also be hugely symbolic for the country as the ANC has led this first period of democracy.





Figures who were once in the ANC, such as Julius Malema who leads the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and former president Jacob Zuma who, while still an ANC member, has started a new party, uMkhonto weSizwe, named after the former paramilitary wing of the ANC, are playing a significant role in election campaigning. 

One argument being highlighted in the campaign is that industry control is even now, three decades after 1994, still in the hands of white corporate bosses – and there is much evidence this is the case. That message might stymie the parliamentary ambitions of the Democratic Alliance – which boasts an effective and efficient administration in the Western Cape, but has a senior leadership that is entirely white.
Some opinion polls have the ANC as low as 40% in voter support  And, although the ANC insists it is clawing back ground, there is no secret in Pretoria that overtures have been made to the EFF as to which portfolios in a coalition government would satisfy its ambitions.  Some feel Malema may demand the vice presidency as part of a deal.
Meanwhile, South Africa’s highest court has just ruled that Zuma cannot stand for parliament in the election. The court ruled that anyone convicted of an offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment cannot serve in the National Assembly, until five years after the completion of a sentence. 
Zuma was sentenced to a 15-month prison term in 2021 after he was found guilty of contempt of court for refusing to testify before a judicial commission. He was released after three months as part of a presidential remission programme.
The ANC has declined to pursue disciplining or expelling Zuma for forming a rival party. Not expelling him may be the first step towards a coalition after the elections.
ANC history
The celebrations of electoral victory by Mandela and the ANC in 1994 were shared by domestic and international well-wishers who had supported Mandela throughout his years of imprisonment.

But Mandela and the ANC faced formidable problems. They inherited a public administrative system used to serving only a small white population. One of Mandela’s first decisions was based on the realisation he could not trust the system and its personnel to deliver benefits to all. 
It meant the appointment of ANC personnel to key positions nationwide, not on the basis of capacity and ability, but loyalty. It meant many of the ANC’s reformative and distributive policies were never fully or well implemented, for lack of expertise.

      What happened to Nelson Mandela's South Africa? A new podcast series marks 30 years of post-apartheid democracy




Mandela had been in prison for close on three decades. He had never had any training or experience as a president. Deputy president Thabo Mbeki (1994-99) became the technical brains behind the government. When he succeeded Mandela as president in 1999 he brought to bear his international experience. His policy of Black Economic Empowerment  (later Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment) was derived from US policies of positive discrimination. It encouraged the creation of black firms which, all other things being equal, would be awarded municipal contracts. 
But many of the contracts, such as the construction of housing units, resulted in poorly planned and poorly built houses.. And bribery at municipal level began to burgeon as firms lobbied, and then paid, municipal administrators to award them the contracts.
When the internal politics of the ANC, an uneasy amalgam of those who had stayed to resist apartheid underground, or who had been imprisoned, and those who had left, either to fight or organise international support, led to the downfall of Mbeki and his replacement by Zuma, things started to go badly wrong. 
The presidency of Zuma, a man who had never had his own bank account, led to the beginnings of a discernible economic downturn and saw also municipal corruption grow into national corruption. Under Zuma, “state capture”, such as the plundering of state-owned organisations and nationalised industries by cronies of the president, and his appointment of unqualified people to run huge national and international operations led to a growing sense that South Africa had lost the promise it once held. 
In effect the much-trumpeted legacy of Mandela of an end to white domination and the creation of a new South Africa is far from complete. And 2024 probably marks a historic lurch towards a coalition government – something very different to the past, but also one that might be able to refresh South Africa’s reputation.

ChatGPTâs use of a soundalike Scarlett Johansson reflects a troubling history of gender-stereotyping in technology,https://theconversation.com/chatgpts-use-of-a-soundalike-scarlett-johansson-reflects-a-troubling-history-of-gender-stereotyping-in-technology-230647,3014646,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Gender stereotypical jobs, Scarlett Johansson, Chatbots, virtual assistants, Siri, Alexa, ChatGPT, GPT-4o","
Actress Scarlett Johansson released a statement this week expressing anger and concern that OpenAI used a voice “eerily similar” to her own as a default voice for ChatGPT. 
The voice in question, called Sky, has been available to users since September 2023, but the resemblance to Johansson’s voice became clearer last week when OpenAI demoed an updated model called GPT-4o. Johansson claims that OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman previously asked her if she would provide her voice for ChatGPT, and she had declined the invitation.
The warm and playful tone of Sky’s voice bears a striking resemblance to the digital companion called Samantha in the film Her (2013), voiced by Johansson. 

Although Altman has since claimed that Sky’s voice was never meant to resemble Johansson’s, he seemed to allude to this connection by simply tweeting the word “her” on May 13, 2024 — the day that GPT-4o launched. 





OpenAI has since explained their process for creating Sky’s voice in a blog post, stating that the voice was provided by “a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.” However, as increasingly smaller audio samples can be used to generate synthetic voices, cloning a person’s voice without their consent is easier than ever.
As a sound studies scholar, I’m interested in the ways that AI technology is introducing new questions and concerns about voice and identity. My research situates recent developments, anxieties and aspirations about AI within longer histories of voice and technology. 

Stolen voices
This is not the first time a performer has objected to an unlicensed simulation of their voice.
In 1988, Bette Midler pursued legal action against Ford Motor Company for using a voice resembling hers in a series of advertisements. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ultimately ruled in her favour, with Circuit Judge John T. Noonan writing in his decision that “to impersonate her voice is to pirate her identity.”
Tom Waits launched a similar and successful lawsuit against Frito-Lay after hearing what sounded like his own gravelly voice in a radio commercial for Doritos. As musicologist Mark C. Samples describes, this case “elevat[ed] a person’s vocal timbre to the level of his or her visual representation” in the eyes of the law. 
Legislators have only just begun to tackle the challenges and risks that accompany the increased adoption of AI. 
For example, a recent ruling by the Federal Communications Commission banned robocalls that use AI-generated voices. In the absence of more specific policy and legal frameworks, these examples of voice mimicry continue to act as important precedents.

      FCC bans robocalls using deepfake voice clones − but AI-generated disinformation still looms over elections




Chatbots and gender
OpenAI’s apparent reference to the movie Her in the design of Sky’s voice also situates ChatGPT within a long-standing tradition of assigning female voices and personas to computers.
The first chatbot was built in 1966 by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum. Called ELIZA, Weizenbaum designed it to communicate with its users in the same manner as a psychotherapist. ELIZA was an influence and reference for today’s digital assistants, which often have feminized voices as their default setting. When first launched in 2011, Siri told stories about ELIZA as if it were a friend.

Many technoscience scholars, including Thao Phan and Heather Woods, have criticized the way tech companies appeal to gender stereotypes in the design of voice assistants. 
Communication scholars Jessa Lingel and Kate Crawford suggest that voice assistants invoke the historically feminized role of the secretary, as they undertake both administrative and emotional labour. In referencing this submissive trope, they argue that tech companies seek to distract users from the surveillance and data extraction that voice assistants carry out. 
OpenAI says that when casting for ChatGPT’s voices, they sought out “an approachable voice that inspires trust.” It is telling that the voice the company chose to make users feel at ease with rapid advances in AI technology sounds like a woman. Even as the conversational abilities of voice assistants become much more advanced, Sky’s voice demonstrates that the tech industry has yet to move on from these regressive tropes.  
Protecting our voices
Johansson’s statement ends with a call for “transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation” to protect vocal likeness and identity. Indeed, it will be interesting to see what legal and policy ramifications might follow from this high-profile case of unauthorized voice simulation.  
However, celebrities are not the only ones who should be concerned about how their voices are being used by AI systems. Our voices are already being recorded and used to train AI by platforms like Zoom and Otter.ai and employed in the training of virtual assistants like Alexa.
The illicit AI impersonation of Johansson’s voice might seem like a story from a dystopian future, but it is best understood in the context of ongoing debates about voice, gender and privacy. It’s a sign not of what’s to come, but of what already exists.

Drug companies pay doctors over A$11 million a year for travel and education. Hereâs which specialties received the most,https://theconversation.com/drug-companies-pay-doctors-over-a-11-million-a-year-for-travel-and-education-heres-which-specialties-received-the-most-230303,3014512,"Marketing, Doctors, Big Pharma, Health, Medical specialists, Prescribing, Drug companies, Pharmaceutical industry, Conflict of interest, specialists, Drug marketing, New research, Pharma industry, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Drug companies are paying Australian doctors millions of dollars a year to fly to overseas conferences and meetings, give talks to other doctors, and to serve on advisory boards, our research shows. 
Our team analysed reports from major drug companies, in the first comprehensive analysis of its kind. We found drug companies paid more than A$33 million to doctors in the three years from late 2019 to late 2022 for these consultancies and expenses. 
We know this underestimates how much drug companies pay doctors as it leaves out the most common gift – food and drink – which drug companies in Australia do not declare.
Due to COVID restrictions, the timescale we looked at included periods where doctors were likely to be travelling less and attending fewer in-person medical conferences. So we suspect current levels of drug company funding to be even higher, especially for travel. 





What we did and what we found
Since 2019, Medicines Australia, the trade association of the brand-name pharmaceutical industry, has published a centralised database of payments made to individual health professionals. This is the first comprehensive analysis of this database. 
We downloaded the data and matched doctors’ names with listings with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (Ahpra). We then looked at how many doctors per medical specialty received industry payments and how much companies paid to each specialty.
We found more than two-thirds of rheumatologists received industry payments. Rheumatologists often prescribe expensive new biologic drugs that suppress the immune system. These drugs are responsible for a substantial proportion of drug costs on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).

The specialists who received the most funding as a group were 
cancer doctors (oncology/haematology specialists). They received 
over $6 million in payments.
This is unsurprising given recently approved, expensive new cancer drugs. Some of these drugs are wonderful treatment advances; others offer minimal improvement in survival or quality of life. 
A 2023 study found doctors receiving industry payments were more likely to prescribe cancer treatments of low clinical value.
Our analysis found some doctors with many small payments of a few hundred dollars. There were also instances of large individual payments.
Why does all this matter?
Doctors usually believe drug company promotion does not affect them. But research tells a different story. Industry payments can affect both doctors’ own prescribing decisions and those of their colleagues.
A US study of meals provided to doctors – on average costing less than US$20 – found the more meals a doctor received, the more of the promoted drug they prescribed.

Another study found the more meals a doctor received from manufacturers of opioids (a class of strong painkillers), the more opioids they prescribed. Overprescribing played a key role in the opioid crisis in North America. 
Overall, a substantial body of research shows industry funding affects prescribing, including for drugs that are not a first choice because of poor effectiveness, safety or cost-effectiveness.
Then there are doctors who act as “key opinion leaders” for companies. These include paid consultants who give talks to other doctors. An ex-industry employee who recruited doctors for such roles said:

Key opinion leaders were salespeople for us, and we would routinely measure the return on our investment, by tracking prescriptions before and after their presentations […] If that speaker didn’t make the impact the company was looking for, then you wouldn’t invite them back.

We know about payments to US doctors
The best available evidence on the effects of pharmaceutical industry funding on prescribing comes from the US government-run program called Open Payments.
Since 2013, all drug and device companies must report all payments over US$10 in value in any single year. Payment reports are linked to the promoted products, which allows researchers to compare doctors’ payments with their prescribing patterns.
Analysis of this data, which involves hundreds of thousands of doctors, has indisputably shown promotional payments affect prescribing.

US research also shows that doctors who had studied at medical schools that banned students receiving payments and gifts from drug companies were less likely to prescribe newer and more expensive drugs with limited evidence of benefit over existing drugs. 
In general, Australian medical faculties have weak or no restrictions on medical students seeing pharmaceutical sales representatives, receiving gifts, or attending industry-sponsored events during their clinical training. They also have no restrictions on academic staff holding consultancies with manufacturers whose products they feature in their teaching.
So a first step to prevent undue pharmaceutical industry influence on prescribing decisions is to shelter medical students from this influence by having stronger conflict-of-interest policies, such as those mentioned above.
A second is better guidance for individual doctors from professional organisations and regulators on the types of funding that is and is not acceptable. We believe no doctor actively involved in patient care should accept payments from a drug company for talks, international travel or consultancies.
Third, if Medicines Australia is serious about transparency, it should require companies to list all payments – including those for food and drink – and to link health professionals’ names to their Ahpra registration numbers. This is similar to the reporting standard pharmaceutical companies follow in the US and would allow a more complete and clearer picture of what’s happening in Australia.
Patients trust doctors to choose the best available treatments to meet their health needs, based on scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness. They don’t expect marketing to influence that choice.

Friday essay: crimes against humankind â Rai Gaita on Israelâs war on Gaza and the student protests,https://theconversation.com/friday-essay-crimes-against-humankind-rai-gaita-on-israels-war-on-gaza-and-the-student-protests-230014,3014511,"Universities, Israel, Free speech, Gaza, Student protests, Friday essay, Israel-Gaza","
I dedicated Justice and Hope: Essays Lectures and Other Writings, published last year, to my grandchildren, but I intended this dedication, implicitly, to be to all young people. This is what I wrote.

More and more, I fear, knowledge of affliction and cruelty will test their understanding of what it means to share a common humanity with all the peoples of the earth, and to a degree almost too awful to imagine, their faith that the world is a good world despite the suffering and the evil in it. What can sustain that faith? I believe there are few questions more urgently in need of sober realism in their formulation and in the answers offered to them.

Subjected as they have been to corrosive disillusionment about political institutions, I feared then that hope had deserted young people. The student protests in response to Israel’s war on Gaza and its people have changed my mind about that. At times, the protests appear to express a joyful affirmation that this kind of political action can, indirectly, change the world. I welcome that, though with qualifications I sometimes fear will reduce the voice of hope in me to a whisper.

Generally, I’m not keen on a declaration of interest in these circumstances, but sometimes it matters. The understanding and discussion of ethical matters is always personal, though this should not compromise a robust attempt to to see things as they are.
My wife is Jewish, and I have Jewish stepchildren and step-grandchildren. Hardly a day passes when I am not at some level aware that in the lifetime of my parents, most of the nations of Europe were glad to see Jews exterminated like vermin unfit to live on this earth.
For many people of my age (I’m 78), the Holocaust taught two important lessons. First, irrespective of what they have done and what they are like, no human being should be treated as vermin, outside the boundaries of a sense of a common humanity. That is perhaps why so many postwar preambles to international law speak of the Dignity (capital intended) of humanity: of the inalienable dignity of peoples of all ethnic, religious and national kinds. 
The second is that because of their allegiance to nation or religion, which often forms an essential element of their identity, good people will sometimes do, support or condone morally terrible deeds. To believe therefore they could not be good people is to be blind to the tragic ethical complexity of the human condition.
My wife is also Israeli. We are shocked and deeply pained by what Israel is doing in Gaza and the West Bank, but do not believe what Israel has become was inevitable from at least 1948, when Israel became a state. (The Palestinians call this the Nakba.) Between then and now, many possibilities were squandered, not realised, or not even noticed.
Millions of people throughout the world have marched in the streets of their cities, towns and villages to express their revulsion at Israel’s war against Gaza.
They do not need the results of investigations to know what they see every night on their television screens is also a war against Gaza’s people, if not because it is motivated by genocidal intent, then because it is driven by a fierce desire for revenge that has shown contempt for its victims. 

They are outraged because nothing Hamas did on October 7, or could realistically threaten to do, justifies what Israel has done in response. It is not only the number of dead and wounded, estimated at 35,709 dead and 79,990 wounded at the time of writing, that motivates them. It is the destruction in Gaza of a human way of living. 
When one reflects on how often people have spoken of the way a sense of place has shaped them and coloured their orientation to the world, their sense of being at home in it, then one can see what a heinous crime the physical destruction of a city can be. The claim that it is disproportionate – even overwhelmingly disproportionate – is in the wrong ethical space to capture the moral and human awfulness of it. Summoning every ethical resonance of the phrase, it is a crime against humankind.
Israel has destroyed this kind of “at homeness in the world” for the people of Gaza. Palestinians are fighting to achieve it in their struggle for national self-determination. To defend or fight for the conditions of this sense of belonging in the world, states will do things that are against morality and law.
That is why Israel claims, falsely, that its war against Hamas is a fight for its existence and, even more absurdly, for Western civilisation.

Intergenerational trauma
It seems that most Israelis and a significant portion of the Jewish diaspora support the war. One reason is that they have not been able to overcome the trauma caused by October 7. It was not the terrorist killing of civilians, including children and babies, that caused it. Nor was it the brutal sexual violence, or the fact more Jews were killed in a single day than at any time since the Holocaust, though of course these were fundamental. 
What made the trauma intergenerational throughout the Jewish diaspora, I think, is that those terrible deeds were committed with exultant Jew hatred. The trauma was compounded by equivocation over the moral and political significance of October 7 by a surprising number of intellectuals on the left and sometimes, even the denial of their sympathy. 
When the UN Secretary General António Guterres said, in a tone of frustration many Jews took to be directed at them, that October 7 did “not occur in a vacuum”, they took him to mean they should understand the crimes of that day in their historical context. Many believed that was equivalent to a justification of these crimes. Guterres angrily denied the latter.
He was obviously right, but it was foolish of him to say it. His statement encompassed the ethical particularity of October 7 and Palestinian terrorist attacks more generally. This was echoed by many others, who described the deeds of October 7 as the actions of freedom or resistance fighters. 
Obviously, one action can fall under several descriptions, not all of them morally salient. Some terrorists are resistance fighters; some resistance fighters are terrorists. And, it is important to note, some who might have been resistance fighters forfeited the right to that expression, with its heroic resonance, because of how they acted. 
At least some of the Hamas fighters forfeited it with their actions on October 7, even if they might rightly have been described as resistance fighters when they broke through the Israel-Gaza border fence.

They did not forfeit it because they killed civilians, or because they raped (and perpetrated crimes worse than rapes) – nor even because they killed children. They forfeited it because of the obscene glee they took in those deeds as an expression of their hatred of Jews.
If one wants to understand how they could do it, as of course one should, one needs more than knowledge of the occupation and daily suffering and humiliations of the Palestinians. One needs a political psychology of the kind writer Adam Shatz offered in a fine article in London Review of Books titled Vengeful Pathologies. That is not what most people had in mind when they talked of the need to place October 7 – politically and morally – in its historical context.
There is another important thing to note. Sometimes, confronted with morally terrible deeds, we are incredulous, bewildered, and we ask of their agents, “How was it possible that they did it?”. 
That is not a question that invites an answer – which is, perhaps, to say it is not really a question. We are not in need of facts, or expert knowledge. We may know the motives, which fully explain why they did it. Often they will be ordinary, banal motives: perhaps they were frightened, vengeful, or sadists, or were obeying orders.
It’s a fact of human life that we sometimes respond this way to morally terrible deeds. But that’s not why I’ve drawn attention to this  phenomenon. Rather, I want to suggest that the fact we do, the generality of that fact in human life, is intrinsic to (because it partly constitutes) our concept of the morally terrible. People who are blank to this kind of response in themselves or in others, have an impoverished understanding of the morally terrible, or, if you are at ease with this word, of “evil”.
An analogy might help. Many are bewildered by the disappearance of a human personality in death. That’s not because they hanker for supernatural beliefs of any kind. They know the facts of science. This kind of bewilderment is partly what constitutes our idea that human beings are unique and irreplaceable: not just to those who love and mourn them, but period. 
The aggressive calls to see the atrocities of October 7 within the context of clear explanations felt to some like an uncomprehending assault on the way people – not only Jewish people – responded to them.
However, I believe it is a moral tragedy for the Jewish diaspora that it has not allowed its trauma to transform into an urgent obligation to criticise what Israel has done in its name. I would say the same about the citizens of Israel. The response of both communities – but especially of the diaspora – is, as it has been for many years, “Israel has enough haters in world. Why should we join them?” 
But just as nothing Hamas or other terrorists have done was comparable to October 7, nothing Israel has done, not even in 1948, is comparable to what it has done and continues to do since October 7.

When one listens to statements by Israel’s political leaders, it is easy to believe they are out of touch with reality. But it is also necessary to understand the brutal realpolitik that has long been part of Israeli international politics. It is based on the belief that if one can sit out the world’s condemnation, there will come a time when the world will no longer care – or not enough for it to matter. 
That may be true of older leaders in the West, but it is unlikely to be true of younger people in the Global South. Of them, Pankaj Mishra wrote in March in The London Review of Books: 

At the same time, Gaza has become for countless powerless people the essential condition of political and ethical consciousness in the 21st century – just as the first world war was for a generation in the West. 

It will be different for younger people in the Global North, but the alienation from Israel now evident in many of them is likely to continue to affect their attitude to it profoundly in the future, even as it diminishes.
The concept of a university
The student protests began some six months after the marches in streets, towns and villages throughout the world. They were inspired by the same revulsion at the crimes in Gaza and the West Bank, but focused on what the students believed to be the varying forms of complicity of their institutions in those crimes. 
Journalists and some students have likened the current protests to those of the 1960s and early 1970s. The reason is obvious, but there is a fundamental difference: in the 60s and 70s, institutions called universities regarded themselves as answerable to an historically deep conception of a university. This governed ideas about what was possible or not. Included, of course, was discussion of what could or could not be done at a university in the name of free speech and protest. 
It was taken for granted universities would host faculties (or schools) of humanities – and that their students and academic staff would therefore form political and moral beliefs that would sometimes be radically contrary to those of their fellow citizens. Expressed in actions – or sometimes even just expressed – these beliefs would also be against the law.
Recall the arguments about pornography and abortion in the 1960s, and about torture after September 11. Not to mention arguments about the justifiability of infanticide in certain circumstances, which started in the late 1970s and are ongoing. 
Regarding deeds rather than arguments, Monash University students openly collected money for non-military aid to Vietnam’s pro-unification National Liberation Front (NLF) in the late 1960s, when it was killing their fellow citizens fighting in Vietnam. They chanted “Ho Ho Ho Chi Minh, the NLF is gonna win”, though “Uncle Ho” was at the time believed to have murdered at least 30,000 peasants in a program of “land reforms”.
When the institutions now called universities deliberate about which disciplines (or even faculties) they will support, no serious concept of a university even remotely enters their minds. Some universities have axed philosophy, classics, physics – or even the entire faculty of humanities. Clearly, they would not be moved by the argument that institutions lacking these things do not deserve to be called universities.
If anyone old enough to have been a student in the 1960s were to offer such an argument, they would betray they had been asleep for at least 40 years. It would never occur to younger people to do so: that concept of the university died before many of them were born.
Admittedly, even in the 1960s, the argument didn’t have much life in it. Less than 20 years later, at a meeting convened to protect philosophy departments in the UK, philosophers repeatedly told a minister of education, who had come to hear what they had to say, that an institution without a philosophy department – and most certainly one that closed its philosophy department – could not be called a university. He listened patiently for almost an hour and then responded with evident irritation, “In that case, we will call it something else”. The philosophers didn’t know what to say. There was nothing to say. Only a lament was truthfully on offer.
The concept of a university the philosophers appealed to relied on other notions, whose place in living speech was equally unconvincing. Vocation, collegiality, a community of scholars, love of truth – even truth itself.
When scepticism about truth, and hostility to the intensity that went with talk of love of it, became pervasive in many humanities disciplines, the die was cast: as the UK philosophers discovered. Speaking truth to a seductively cool corporate urbanity that found intensity distasteful proved as least as difficult as speaking it to power.
Serious discussion
If they cannot appeal to a serious concept of a university, what can students and staff appeal to when they ask what should be permitted on campus? I don’t know exactly, but here is a rough answer: students and staff should be permitted to say in political forums on campus what they have come to believe in serious discussion in the classroom.  
They should therefore be prepared to say with Machiavelli that political leaders should not desire to be good, and that they should love their country more than their soul. To say with Frantz Fanon that the oppressed can justifiably use political violence, including terror, against their oppressors. To say with Marx that we should aim for revolution. 
And to say with many contemporary writers, including Israelis, that Israel is irredeemably a racist colonial settler state that should cease to exist as a Jewish state – or with the Israeli historian Benny Morris that the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian Arabs should have been completed in 1948. 
They should be prepared to say, with some right-wing Israeli nationalists, that Jordan should become the home for a Palestinian nation. And to say, with many critical legal theorists, that international law as it stands is Eurocentric in ways that have favoured colonial exploitation of peoples in the Global South – and therefore lacks the authority to claim jurisdiction over them. And to say more.
Recently, university leaders asked the federal government for advice on what counts as unlawful conduct on their campuses. This implies they would act against students who behaved unlawfully. Perhaps that is why a student at ANU was suspended for expressing unconditional support for Hamas. I assume the student was not suspended for her foolish, effectively amoral idea one might give unconditional support to a political entity. It seems more likely the university suspended her because Hamas is listed by the government as a terrorist organisation. 

Students who study the Cold War, and intellectuals’ arguments about it at the time, are likely to read famous writers and philosophers who refused to condemn mass murder in the Soviet Union – especially if that condemnation was demanded by those who refused to condemn the murder of communists or left-wing leaders and political activists in South America and Asia. 
Reading and discussing these thinkers in class, some students might agree with them. They may, for similar reasons, refuse to condemn Hamas – especially when the condemnation is demanded by those who refuse to condemn what Israel is doing in Gaza and on the West Bank, but instead support it. 
I find it hard to appreciate the moral difference between refusing to condemn Hamas and refusing to condemn Israel’s terrorism in Gaza and the terrorism by settlers on the West Bank (who are often supported by Israel’s defence forces and government ministers). There are, to be sure, important moral differences between the horrors of October 7 and the current war, but someone who believes they can weigh them to determine definitively which is worse must be using scales made in hell.
One can also argue over whether the thousands of dead civilians in Gaza were intentionally killed, or whether they were killed due to reckless, often opportunist disregard of their lives. (Because of Israel’s ferocious need of revenge and its determination it would not often, or not seriously, risk the lives of its soldiers merely to protect the lives of Gazans, whose humanity is not visible to them.)
The difference will matter to the International Court of Justice when it considers whether Israel is guilty of genocide. Morally, though, it will be weighed only by connoisseurs of evil. 
Legitimate and illegitimate persuasion
An institution worthy of the title of university would see that the suspended ANU student could have reached the belief that made her refuse to condemn Hamas by reading prescribed texts and discussing them in her courses. Such a university would protect her. 
Not only would it protect her to say what she believes in tutorials, but to express it in the form of protests on campus, ranging from discussion and argument in public lecture theatres to chanting and displaying posters. That is, provided those actions observe a distinction between legitimate and illegitimate persuasion.
That distinction is as old as Socrates. Legitimate persuasion requires people to renounce their power to make others believe something only because they have lied, successfully exploited that person’s ignorance, hidden relevant information, intimidated them, or exploited their vulnerability to sentimental kitsch – or more generally, their bad ear for what rings false. 
All such forms of persuasion must be renounced in genuine conversation, as a condition of the participants’ respect for one another – and for their human need of truth as a need of the soul, as Simone Weil put it. If persuasion compels, it will do so in the way logic compels. To someone who says in response to what they take to be a valid argument, “I see that I must accept the conclusion”, one would not say, “Don’t be such a wimp. Try. Show a free spirit.”
This is also true when the discussion involves persuasion directed to the head and heart, inseparably combined. This distinctive form of understanding is partly defined by its resistance to sentimentality, pathos, kitsch and so on. 
The university, as I have been describing it, was a community of scholars in conversation. Of course, a conversational argument can be fierce: while being respectful of the distinction between legitimate and illegitimate forms of persuasion. For some, that can be intimidating. 
But I think one must distinguish feeling intimidated from being intimidated – by someone who intends to intimidate, consciously or unconsciously.
Protest camps on university lawns are not seminar rooms and chanting is not a form of conversation, but they can be invitations to conversations. In this respect, they share a quality with non-violent forms of civil disobedience.
I think of civil disobedience as an act of civic friendship. The idea that the concept of friendship can mark a distinctive form of political respect in a democratic society is as old as Aristotle. At difficult moments in their friendship, friends must call on each other to attend to what is endangering their friendship.
“It’s time to talk, seriously and truthfully,” one might say to the other. In a similar way, citizens may sometimes feel compelled to call on their fellow citizens to acknowledge what threatens to undermine the conditions of a just and truthful political community. “Hey! It’s time to talk. We can no longer evade it.”
Of course, it takes time for that to be heard. And once it is? It doesn’t need to be taken up. That’s in the nature of an invitation – just as it is in the nature of a conversation that we don’t know where it will go.
Would a conversation like this be possible between those with relatives murdered on October 7 and those with relatives murdered in Gaza? Those who would deny this, or who believe the suggestion (almost grotesquely) lacks political seriousness, they should be told to take their protests to the streets. 
A university in which such conversations were possible, and such actions permitted, would, of course, have to acknowledge that as a citizen, a lawbreaker protected on campus would be liable to arrest off campus – probably justifiably. 
When the concept of a university had life in it, no one suggested the values of a university should be the values of the general community, or that what should count as freedom of speech and political activity on a campus should apply in wider society. 
Uncannily haunting
Though defunct, the memory of the university as it existed in the 1960s remains uncannily haunting. That’s evident when people appeal to academic freedom in its name. 
The current resistance to police presence on campuses is motivated by this concept – which was used in similar situations over 50 years before. Students have protested not only as morally concerned citizens, but as members of a community who believed they could appeal to the distinctive obligations that fall on universities, as universities, to avoid being complicit in grave injustices. 
Description of the conceptual features of a university – its conceptual skeleton really – is possible, just as it is possible to describe the conceptual features of chivalry or chastity. That is why the concept of a university can still have effects, like a ghost rattling its chains, in a world that mocks it as having never described anything real – only the elitist nostalgia of a handful of academics who dreamed of a golden age that never existed. But it cannot speak to us in a way that would enable creative engagement with it. As things stand, our life with language can give it no voice. 
The requirement to allow certain forms of speech and action derives not from the idea of a university, but from considerations about what it is to seriously teach. It would obviously be absurd for a teacher in the corporate teaching institutions called universities to teach set texts of Marx, Fanon and Sartre and say to students, “Read them, then we’ll discuss them, but don’t believe them.”
Nothing, however, that is essential to the identity of such institutions  prevents them from forbidding students from expressing beliefs they formed in class discussion in political forums on campus, or from axing the courses, the disciplines to which they belong, or faculties, if they create problems with donors or the government (though it might prove embarrassing for a time).
The embarrassment would be caused by the faint memory of a defunct concept. Therefore, it could be an occasion for universities to face the reality of what they have become – and without a trace of guilt, to purge their institutional memories of uncanny resonances.
At the beginning of this essay, I said I have serious qualifications about the hope the students’ protests inspired in me. Aspects of the protests bewilder and alarm me. I do not understand the aggressive contempt (it appears) with which so many participants speak of Zionism and, worse, Zionists. I find it hard not to hear the voice of Hamas in their tone and therefore in how I should understand their meaning when they chant, “From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be free”. Presumably they mean free of Zionists. 
Do they not know there are many ways of being a Zionist – from the vile ways of some of the right-wing members of the Israeli government to the profoundly humane ways of anti-state Zionists like Hannah Arendt and Martin Buber? 
Do they not know that in Israel, Zionists like the director of Breaking the Silence, an organisation recording testimonies of Israeli soldiers about crimes they and others have committed against Palestinians, receive death threats? 
Do they believe because they are Zionists, such people deserve their contempt? 
Such Zionists believe Jews have a need of and a right to institutions of political and cultural self-determination in the land “between the river and the sea”, provided it is consistent with the realisation of the Palestinians’ same need and right. If one can be a Zionist without being a Jew, then I am that kind of Zionist.
Many protesters believe Israel could be compelled to cease to exist in any Zionist form. That belief is dangerously out of touch with reality. Israel will never be compelled to give up what it believes to be its responsibility to realise the need of the Jewish people for self-determination. Not militarily – it has nuclear weapons – and not under the pressure of boycotts, divestments and international hostility. For anything like the foreseeable future, Israel will continue to exist as a Jewish state. 
Political realism requires one to acknowledge that the Palestinians will receive justice only if Israel is persuaded, albeit under considerable pressure, to give it. It will do so only if it is consistent with some form of Jewish self-determination. 
The hope that a radically anti-Zionist project can be achieved is a fantasy. As such, it expresses the kind of thoughtlessness Hannah Arendt argued could produce great evil. The kind of thoughtlessness she had in mind is a failure of judgement that erodes genuinely critical thinking.

It is a conceit on the part of the institutions now called universities to believe they can teach students to be seriously critical thinkers. This was often so, even when the concept of a university meant something. 
They can teach students facts, how to weigh them in support of conclusions, how to argue, in the sense in which philosophy departments teach them to be good at argument. They can even teach judgement about how to weigh facts as evidence to support certain propositions. But they cannot, in anything like the same way, teach them to possess the courage or humility necessary if one is to care more for truth than the opinion of one’s peers or fame.
The need for such virtues could be appreciated in what we now call the “culture” of institutions where the academic form of the life of the mind was partly constituted by the distinction between vocations and careers: and by hardheaded talk of the love of truth. Or as Simone Weil put it, the spirit of truth in love – in love with the wondrous treasures available to students and staff in their common effort to understand the world and themselves. Institutions now called universities put obstacles in the way of developing those virtues, enacting them and even understanding the need for them. 
Nor can universities teach – in the same way they can teach judgement about factual matters or how to argue – the kind of sensibility necessary to understand the meanings of things in our lives. A sensibility in which feeling and thought are inseparable. A sensibility that informs efforts to try to see things as they are, in the domain of reflection.
That domain includes, of course, ethical questions about the nature of love, virtue, what counts as sobriety in political action and what is needed to become resistant to the enchantment of rhetoric and spin. 
Albert Camus said he distinguished between two kinds of intelligence: intelligent intelligence and stupid intelligence. 
Stupid intelligence is like what Arendt called thoughtlessness. It can be high-flying and can pass for being critical because it takes a self-regarding pleasure in debunking. But it seldom stops to question the assumptions that inform the debunking. 
Stupid intelligence can be formidable, intimidating and quick on its feet. It can take you, deservedly, to the highest reaches of academic life and to international fame. But it is not thoughtful. 
It cannot, of itself, take you to wisdom or make you truly answerable to someone who calls on you to be serious. It cannot take you to the virtues necessary for thought that constantly reflects critically on its assumptions. 
How do we restore intelligent intelligence, the conditions that generate and nourish thoughtfulness in our institutions of education? That is our challenge, if hope is not to decline into fantasy.
This essay is based on the annual Jim Carlton Integrity Lecture delivered recently at the Melbourne Law School.

How First Nations fashion design can rewrite painful memories and be a powerful method of healing,https://theconversation.com/how-first-nations-fashion-design-can-rewrite-painful-memories-and-be-a-powerful-method-of-healing-227679,3014510,"Fashion, Sorry Day, Stolen Generations, First Nations art, First Nations fashion, Visual art and design","
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander readers are advised that this article contains names, images and stories of deceased people.

Around the world, fashion researchers, designers and artists are exploring the links between clothing, adornment and wellbeing. 
“Enclothed cognition” considers the psychology of clothing, and designers are exploring how to create garments to heal the wearer.
First Nations people understand the power of connection to cultural clothing and adornment. Items like possum and kangaroo skin cloaks can contribute to healing and cultural practice.





But it’s not only traditional clothing that can lead to healing. In Australia, there is a rise of designers and artists creating and fashioning painful Protectionist-era clothing on the runway and in the galleries.
By recreating clothing tied to painful and traumatic memories and histories, these designers and artists hope to share these horrific policies, rewrite the meaning behind them, and move forward in healing.
A history of missions, reserves and trauma
First Nations peoples living in controlled reserves, missions and stations were forced to wear plain clothing and expected to keep them well-maintained and clean. Often, garments were forms of payment and punishment.
In some institutions, First Nations people generated clothing and adornment for interstate and international exhibitions and tourist trades.
These regimes and power through clothing significantly impacted those living there, including their cultural practice, identity and wellbeing. 

There are two national days to pause, acknowledge and remember the Stolen Generation and their families and communities – National Sorry Day on May 26 and the Anniversary of the National Apology to the Stolen Generations on February 13. 
Healing and wellbeing involve a holistic approach, and art contributes to this. 
Using clothing as art or designing garments with a transformative and positive spin can benefit members of the Stolen Generation and their families.
Healing through fashion design
The Queensland Yarrabah community has been experimenting with fashion to tell Yarrabah Mission stories. 
The 2019 Cairns Indigenous Art Fair invited the Djunngaal Yarrabah Elders Group to work on a collection for the Buwal-Barra fashion show. The collection, named ByDaBell, represents the significance of the bell at the Yarrabah Mission, which strictly controlled their day. 
Yarrabah Elders recreated three significant dresses worn in the mission: an everyday casual dress, a church formal dress and a punishment potato sack dress. In doing so, the Elders told a powerful story about their mission experiences and how clothing was used to punish or control. 
For the Yarrabah community and many First Nations people, truth-telling is a form of healing and reminder of resilience.

Healing through truth-telling was also seen weaved within a commissioned wedding dress made for the 2020 Queensland Museum exhibition I Do! Wedding Stories from Queensland.
As a collaborative effort by fashion designer and artist Simone Arnol (Gunggandji), artist and curator Bernard Singleton (Umpila, Djabugay/Yirrgay) and Djunngaal Yarrabah Elders, the garment told stories about mission experiences and the colonial wedding practices within it.
Based on mission-style wedding dresses, the gown featured a five-metre-long circle train embedded with a powerful image of a mission imprisonment. The stained lining from traditional materials represented the suppression of First Nations culture. 

Healing through art garments
Artist Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha/Nukunu) created a piece about the experiences of her grandmother Fanny and great-great-grandmother Florey as domestic servants in the early 1900s. 
The work features two linen aprons, depicting those worn by Flora and Fanny, and 16 hand-blown glass bush plums placed inside and poking through the pockets. Their names were also carefully hand stitched onto each apron.
The piece represents the strength of Flora and Fanny in their roles as matriarchs caring for family and holding onto their cultural identity. 

Shellworked Slippers by Esme Timbery (Bidjigal) contains 200 pairs of tiny, adorned shoes to represent the children of the Stolen Generation and the shell craft practice of Aboriginal women at La Perouse, Sydney.
Made from fabric and encrusted with glitter and shells of various sizes, colours and designs, the slippers speak to the experiences of the children who were forcibly removed and the strength and resilience of First Nations families and communities. 
While not a uniform of children who were removed and placed in institutions, the large quantity of small and empty shoes reminds the viewer of the suffering and trauma experienced under the Protectionist policies.

Sharing stories, remembering history
First Nations fashion designers and artists are transforming Protectionist-era fashions on the runway and in exhibitions. In doing this, they aim to speak back to racist and colonial policies and heal. 
We need to keep sharing these stories about the true history of this country and how garments repressed and controlled First Nations people. 
The movement toward healing painful memories and intergenerational trauma through garments positively contributes to First Nations people’s wellbeing.
First Nations peoples are resistant and, through clothing, will continue to explore and celebrate culture and identity.

Lifeâs big moments can impact an entrepreneurâs success â but not always in the way youâd expect,https://theconversation.com/lifes-big-moments-can-impact-an-entrepreneurs-success-but-not-always-in-the-way-youd-expect-230436,3014509,"Family, Entrepreneurs, Entrepreneurship, Weddings, Business, Family life, New research, entrepreneurship programs, New research, Australia New Zealand, births","
Entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of any innovative economy. 
New business creation has been shown to have a significant and positive impact on economic growth, innovation and job creation. But it isn’t easy, and most new businesses fail. 

When someone starts a business, they usually aren’t doing it alone – their whole family forms part of the journey. All of them can experience the emotional rollercoaster of entrepreneurship. 
This obviously flows in the other direction as well – founders’ personal lives have their own big ups and downs. 
Big positive changes in a family – including job promotions, weddings and new babies – and negative changes – such as when someone sadly passes away – can really shake things up for someone trying to start a business. 
Yet only minimal research has looked into the extent of these effects on new venture creation. 
In a recently published study, we looked at how big family events affect the success of new ventures.
Surprisingly, our findings reveal that by making entrepreneurs overconfident, certain kinds of positive family events can have a bigger detrimental effect on new venture survival than negative ones. 
Emotions have complicated effects
We used data from the Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics (HILDA) survey to analyse the emotions caused by major family events that entrepreneurs experience.
Our study found that many of these family events had the influence you’d expect based on both intuition and past research – positive events typically helped and negative events typically harmed new venture survival. 

But existing research may oversimplify this connection. The structure of a family – their relationships, emotions and goals – can affect an entrepreneur’s mental state and decision-making in complicated ways.
The effect on founders’ confidence levels is particularly important. Confidence is necessary to start a business, but can become a problem in excess when entrepreneurs overestimate their own abilities.
Notably, some positive events can lead to overconfidence, which could take the form of being overly optimistic about the extent of one’s abilities, or overestimating the accuracy of one’s own beliefs. 
And perhaps counter-intuitively, we found that overconfidence resulting from positive family events had a negative impact on new venture survival. This impact was bigger than the impact of explicitly negative events. 
Why might this be happening?
Two key theories from psychology may help explain why overconfidence ends up being harmful. 

First “affect-as-information theory” suggests that our emotions serve as a kind of compass, guiding us to understand whether a situation is beneficial or harmful. 
When entrepreneurs feel good due to a positive family event, like marriage to a childhood sweetheart, they may lean on their existing knowledge and heuristics. 
Second, entrepreneurs may succumb to “affect priming”, which suggests that emotions influence decision-making by automatically bringing up related ideas and memories. 
Such priming may not just influence what they think, but also how they think. For example, if entrepreneurs are in a good mood, their mind will offer up memories linked to positive emotion – whether relevant or not – to help them make decisions. 
These theories suggest that major family events can influence an entrepreneur’s confidence by subtly and automatically adjusting how they evaluate opportunities and risks in decision-making.

      Emotional intelligence is the key to more successful entrepreneurs




On the one hand, positive family events may lead to a more holistic thinking style and rapid decision-making. This can be beneficial for entrepreneurs who need to make quick and efficient decisions under time and resource constraints. 
However, if entrepreneurs are too confident, believing that their abilities alone can make up for any lack of information, positive family events may just reinforce this overconfidence. 
Like other people, when entrepreneurs think they’re better at things than they actually are, they may begin to believe tasks are easier than they really are. 
This can lead to errors in judgement that seriously harm new ventures. 

How does the research help entrepreneurs?
Our study highlights the embeddedness of family in the entrepreneurial process. 
Entrepreneurs need to be aware of the need to carefully manage their own emotional state, particularly their confidence levels.
Entrepreneurship training and support programs often focus solely on business strategies to make new ventures succeed. This research suggests it is also important to incorporate elements like maintaining emotional health, managing major family events and accessing support.

Ukraine recap: Putin on top as Kyiv scrambles to play catch-up on the battlefield,https://theconversation.com/ukraine-recap-putin-on-top-as-kyiv-scrambles-to-play-catch-up-on-the-battlefield-230787,3014508,"NATO, Joe Biden, Vladimir Putin, Volodymyr Zelensky, Morse code, Antony Blinken, Ukraine invasion 2022, Give me perspective","
Vladimir Putin has been looking pretty chipper of late. Two weeks ago saw him wearing his trademark vulpine smile as he presided over the Victory Day commemorations in Moscow. It was a rather more upbeat occasion than in the two years previously, given recent Russian successes on the battlefield. Then, pausing briefly to unleash a fresh offensive against the Kharkiv region in northeastern Ukraine, he was off to Beijing where he and the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, agreed on closer ties and deeper military cooperation, “to counter Washington’s destructive and hostile course”.
In the interim, Putin has rearranged Russia’s military establishment, shifting several key players including erstwhile defence minister Sergei Shoigu, who has become national security minister. Shoigu’s replacement is deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, an economist. The rationale behind this manoeuvre is to hasten the transition of Russia’s economy fully on to a war footing. But it must be added that the Russian leader also likes to keep his subordinates on their toes and encourage rivalries. 
It’s a far cry from this time last year, writes Stefan Wolff of the University of Birmingham. Since them, Putin has faced down a mutiny from his old crony, the late Wagner Group boss Yevgeny Prigozhin – whose aircraft subsequently and conveniently fell out of the sky not long afterwards. His most credible political foe, the opposition figurehead Alexei Navalny, died suddenly in prison of mysterious circumstances (a medical condition that appears to be on the rise in Putin’s Russia). And his alliances with North Korea and Iran have ensured a steady supply of weaponry, while his own planners worked to transform Russia’s economy on to a war footing.


Since Vladimir Putin sent his war machine into Ukraine on February 24 2022, The Conversation has called upon some of the leading experts in international security, geopolitics and military tactics to help our readers understand the big issues. You can also subscribe to our fortnightly recap of expert analysis of the conflict in Ukraine.






Meanwhile, as Wolff notes here, Russian battlefield successes have all but rolled back the Ukrainian gains from the autumn of 2022. And, while Ukraine is still struggling to regroup and integrate fresh supplies of western armaments into its war planning, Russia has captured some 500 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory over recent months.

      Why Vladimir Putin seems stronger now than he was a year ago




Meanwhile military experts are pointing to a mounting problem for Kyiv: Russian attacks on the Kharkiv oblast from the “sanctuary” of its own soil. The region, which is close to Ukraine’s north-eastern border with Russia, holds Ukraine’s second city: Kharkiv. The local population of about 1.5 million people has been augmented by more than 200,000 refugees from the Russian offensive, but has been bombarded constantly from inside Russia since the start of the full-blown conflict. 
Ukraine is constrained from using western weapons which have been provided on the strict understanding that they can’t be used to attack targets outside Ukraine. This has effectively allowed Moscow to place supply depots and airfields just across the border in the Belgorod province, from which it has been operating with virtual impunity.
But there are signs that Kyiv’s western allies may be rethinking this prohibition, writes Chris Morris, a military strategist at the University of Portsmouth. The rapid success of Putin’s Kharkiv offensive has concentrated minds somewhat. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, told Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on a recent trip to Kyiv that Ukraine should “absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia”. It appears that France is thinking along the same lines.
The big sticking point, though, has been the US – by far the biggest provider of military aid to Kyiv. But from remarks made by the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, when he was in Kyiv on May 15, it appears that this may well change as well. As Morris notes, this could be a significant moment. Being able to hit at Russia’s rear, even Russian territory, would severely disrupt the momentum of the latest offensive and force Moscow to move units away from the front lines.

While Zelensky cajoles his western allies to do more and faster, Putin and Xi have been exploring ever-closer ties as the Russian president visited Beijing recently. But an itinerary chock full of photo opportunities designed to portray Putin as equal partner to the Chinese president cannot disguise the fact that Beijing is playing a cagey game when it comes to backing Moscow against the west, write Marcin Kaczmarski of the University of Glasgow and Natasha Kuhrt of King’s College London.
Kaczmarski and Kuhrt, both experts in international security, note that while Moscow has become increasingly reliant on Beijing because of increasingly harsh western sanctions since the war began, China is being careful not to completely burn all bridges with the west as it needs the export trade, particularly in the automotive sector. 
Nonetheless, they write, there were plenty of signs that a “no-limits friendship” between Beijing and Moscow could pose problems for the west, and not just in terms of the war in Ukraine, but in the wider game of geopolitics.

Blame game
Meanwhile Russian troops push on day by day, gradually consolidating their gains, despite reported heavy losses. James Horncastle, professor in international relations at Simon Fraser University in Canada, believes much of Ukraine’s recent travails can be laid firmly at the door of Kyiv’s western partners, whose hesitancy in providing military aid left Ukraine’s troops desperately short of firepower when and where it was most needed.
It could have been so different. Had Kyiv received the full amount of aid pledged by the west when Ukraine was on the front foot in the autumn of 2022, the stalemate that settled over the battlefield in 2023 may have been avoided. The sad irony is that this aid finally arrived in Ukraine a year later, but the moment had passed. Russia had dug in, it was on its way to reshaping its economy and had secured a steady supply of arms and ammunition from its allies in North Korea and Iran while ramping up its own military industrial sector. 
Horncastle thinks that some, particularly in the Trump wing of the US Republican party, bought too readily into Russian propaganda and disinformation – and Ukraine has paid the price.

      Delays in western aid have put Ukraine in a perilous position




Rebuilding Ukraine
Part of that price has been the devastation of so much of Ukraine. Pictures from Kharkiv show the desperate state of Ukraine’s second city after two years of bombardment. Like Mariupol before it, Kharkiv is being slowly destroyed, building by building. Its energy infrastructure has been wrecked and its citizens terrorised by glide bombs coming in from across the Russian border.

The damage from this war has been enormous across Ukraine. The World Bank has estimated the cost of rebuilding Ukraine at more than US$480 billion (£377 billion) already, with plenty more to come. Half of the country’s energy grid and one-third of its transportation infrastructure has reportedly been damaged by Russian attacks. The United Nations estimates that about 40% of the population needs urgent humanitarian support.
It’s going to be a big bill and, if Ukraine is to prevail in this struggle, it will need deep pockets in the west to help out. As Jeffrey Kucik of the University of Alabama stresses, we live in an interconnected world where “instability somewhere can hurt countries everywhere”, the west can’t afford to abandon Ukraine, which prior to the conflict supplied 10% of the world’s grain.

‘Dits’ and ‘dahs’

With all the state of the art military tech on display in Ukraine, it may come as a surprise to read that Russian forces are still using an century-old communications system in the field. Morse code, developed by Samuel of the same name in the 1880s, may be a very simple affair of dots and dashes (few people won’t know the code for SOS, for example) it can have its advantages over even the most modern telecommunications.
It is reportedly being used to send messages from Russian bombers to their control centres, or from ships of the Baltic Fleet to their shore-based headquarters.
The key, writes Tony Ingesson of Sweden’s Lund University, is its simplicity. Anyone can learn to use it, it is very good when signal quality is poor and it takes very little power. It’s also very simple to encrypt. Cutting edge may be the watchword in war fighting, but as anyone with a bayonet will tell you, the old tech still has its place on the battlefield.

A new ruling says countries â including NZ â must take action on climate change under the law of the sea,https://theconversation.com/a-new-ruling-says-countries-including-nz-must-take-action-on-climate-change-under-the-law-of-the-sea-230420,3014507,"New Zealand, Ocean acidification, small island nations, Science + Environment","
In a significant development for small island nations threatened by rising seas, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) has found greenhouse gases constitute marine pollution.
The tribunal handed down a unanimous advisory opinion this week in its first climate-related judgement. It declared countries must take measures to combat climate change in order to preserve the marine environment under the law of the sea.
The ruling responds to a request from the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS). The commission sought to clarify whether obligations to prevent pollution and protect the marine environment under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) apply to climate change and ocean acidification.
The tribunal’s answer was an emphatic yes. This means countries, including New Zealand, must now address climate change under both the law of the sea and international climate agreements. 





This represents a significant step forward under international law. It clarifies that nation states have obligations beyond the current climate change regime to cut emissions and to take adaptation measures.

Background to the request
Members of COSIS are largely Pacific and Caribbean small island states. They are disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts on the ocean. Threats include sea-level rise, severe weather events and the depletion of fish and other ocean resources.  
The tribunal also received written submissions from 34 other states, including New Zealand and nine international and non-governmental organisations.   
COSIS asked two questions: 

What are the specific obligations on state parties under UNCLOS to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment resulting from climate change or ocean acidification?
What are the specific obligations under UNCLOS to protect and preserve the marine environment in relation to climate change and ocean acidification?  

Preventing pollution and protecting the ocean
The obligations to prevent marine pollution and to protect the marine environment are key objectives under UNCLOS. But none specifically refer to climate change or ocean acidification. This is unsurprising since the convention was adopted in 1982.
Some institutions associated with UNCLOS, such as the International Maritime Organization, have taken steps to address climate impacts on the ocean. But countries have been reluctant to do so. They have often asserted the primary mandate regarding emissions reductions and climate adaptation lay with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). 
The tribunal’s advisory opinion confirmed, for the first time, that the 168 UNCLOS parties must address climate change and ocean acidification in order to comply with their obligations under the law of the sea.  
First, ITLOS confirmed that greenhouse gas emissions and the heat generated by a warming climate meet the definition of “pollution” under Article 1(4) of UNCLOS. This is important because under Part XII of UNCLOS, states have obligations to prevent, control and mitigate pollution of the marine environment from any source. 

Second, the tribunal confirmed the obligation under Article 194 of UNCLOS to prevent and control pollution applies to greenhouse gas emissions. This includes emissions already accumulated in the atmosphere. States therefore must take all necessary measures to address climate change pollution and ocean acidification.
The tribunal adopted a broad definition of “necessary”. It includes indispensable measures but “also other measures which make it possible to achieve that objective”. 
Such measures must be underpinned by science, international rules relating to climate change, and the capacity of individual states. 
The tribunal said states could draw on relevant rules and standards developed by the UNFCCC. But, importantly, it said complying with UNFCCC obligations was “not necessarily sufficient” for states to meet their obligations under UNCLOS.  
Third, the tribunal interpreted the more general obligations under UNCLOS to protect and preserve the marine environment to apply specifically to climate change and ocean acidification. This includes the duty to cooperate, to carry out environmental assessments, and fulfil obligations in the context of fisheries management.
Global importance
Although only advisory and technically addressed to COSIS and its members, this decision is important for all states. 
It clarifies that parties to UNCLOS have a duty under the law of the sea to address climate change impacts on the ocean. It also confirms that it is not sufficient to rely solely on measures under the UNFCCC to meet those obligations.
This means countries must explicitly consider their obligations under the law of the sea and the UNFCCC regime when authorising activities contributing to global climate change, such as offshore oil production, and when adopting climate adaptation measures.

Why knock down all public housing towers when retrofit can sometimes be better?,https://theconversation.com/why-knock-down-all-public-housing-towers-when-retrofit-can-sometimes-be-better-229186,3014506,"Affordable housing, Public housing, Housing policy, Urban renewal, embodied carbon, High-rise apartments, urban redevelopment, construction costs, Building emissions, Better Cities, Construction waste","
The Victorian government is planning Australia’s largest urban renewal project. The plan is to knock down and rebuild 44 large public housing towers in Melbourne. The government says these towers, built in the 1960s and ’70s, are no longer fit for purpose and will cost more to maintain and upgrade than to replace. 
Rebuilding will allow 20,000 more people to live on these sites. However, most of the extra housing will be for private renters or owners. It will not add much more public or affordable housing. 
Rebuilding involves breaking up public housing communities. Many tenants have already been forcibly displaced. Removing stock from the system to make way for future housing reduces the capacity to house people in need amid a housing crisis.
Tearing down so much concrete and other materials and rebuilding in a carbon-constrained world also raises concerns about the public value for money and the loss of embodied carbon in these old buildings. The materials and energy needed to erect a new building create a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. Construction produces almost a fifth of Australia’s emissions.





Some industry experts say the housing towers are structurally sound. They and other sustainability researchers argue that retrofits can bring the buildings up to modern standards.  
This approach would improve thermal comfort, cut energy bills and produce fewer emissions. Some retrofitted buildings could have half the embodied energy of newly built ones. And communities could largely remain in place while the work is done. 
Public housing complexes across Australia face similar renewal proposals. In each case, there are valid questions about the balance of public and private benefit. 
So, how should decisions on public housing account for environmental, social and economic costs and benefits for all the people and interests involved? We draw on our recent research on life-cycle impacts and public housing tenant relocations to answer this question. Our research shows decisions on each tower that are underpinned by a proper process – one that considers all the evidence – could go either way: demolish and rebuild, or retrofit. 

What are the options for ageing buildings?
Broadly, there are three options for older high-rise housing:

maintain
retrofit
knock down and rebuild.

The first option is increasingly unviable. This is because of the urgent need to decarbonise our building stock and the impacts of decades of under-maintenance on such buildings. 
In 2017, the Auditor-General’s Office found  the Victorian government lacked the capacity to “reliably assess the condition of its stock, and consequently whether it is deteriorating at a rate faster than it is ageing”. Maintaining the current stock, while not knowing its condition, would require a massive policy shift and repair effort. 
That leaves us with retrofits or demolition and rebuilding. The government has chosen the third option for all 44 towers.  
The table below sums up the broader costs and benefits of demolition and rebuilding. 

There has been pushback against the impacts on housing tower communities since the  plans were announced last September. Two towers are already empty. Other tenants will be relocated in the coming year.
Tenants claim their human rights were not considered and launched a class action in the Victorian Supreme Court. The action was recently dismissed, but the judge allowed for a revised argument to be put forward in the future. 
The table below shows the costs and benefits of retrofitting. Clearly, for each project, there’s a lot to consider in deciding on the best option. 

Current decision-making is skewed
Proposals for public high-rise buildings often focus on direct, short-term economic costs and benefits. Typically, the equation centres on the costs of retaining buildings versus the windfalls from redevelopment, such as unlocking the latent value of land. 
Proposed changes to the site, such as providing more dwellings and shifting management of public housing to non-government landlords, often alter this equation. Amid a housing crisis, housing supply is understandably high on the policy agenda. Decision-makers often neglect the environmental and social impacts. 
Research has found retrofitting reduces embodied carbon, waste and other environmental impacts by up to 50% compared to rebuilding. 
On top of this are the social impacts of redevelopment that demolishes people’s homes and breaks up communities. This leads to poorer health, economic and social outcomes for public housing tenants. 
In considering all these impacts, the lack of publicly available information on the government’s decision-making is a glaring problem. This comes back to process. 
In particular, there’s a need for transparency about the metrics and evidence used to make decisions, and for accountability for those decisions. At a minimum, independently verified studies of the environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits over the buildings’ life cycle should be made public before decisions are made. 

Retrofitting is a viable option
There are a number of examples where older high-rise housing has been retained and improved. 
For example, in the Cité du Grand Parc in France, 530 apartments in three blocks needed renovation once demolition was ruled out. In this case, sustainability considerations held sway. 
As well as improving the interior, winter gardens and balconies were added. This work extended living spaces and provided more natural light. 
The award-winning project was planned so residents didn’t have to move out. Each flat was completed in around 12 to 16 days.
Closer to home, not-for-profit design agency OFFICE found the Victorian government could save more than A$88 million by refurbishing and including infill development rather than rebuilding the Barak Beacon public housing estate in Port Melbourne. Some 238 social housing dwellings could be added around the existing buildings.
The OFFICE report estimated not having to relocate the community would save $16 million. This approach could also reduce embodied energy by 54% and impacts of land use to produce building materials by 273%.
The Victorian government’s plans intensify the twin challenges of overcoming housing shortages and decarbonising buildings. As Australia’s high-rise housing stock ages, we need a co-ordinated, accountable and fair process for deciding the future of these buildings. This means balancing environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits across all affected people and interests, based on the best information available.

What the International Criminal Courtâs anticipated arrest warrants against Netanyahu and Hamas leaders mean for Canada,https://theconversation.com/what-the-international-criminal-courts-anticipated-arrest-warrants-against-netanyahu-and-hamas-leaders-mean-for-canada-230603,3014458,"Israel, Gaza, Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, International Criminal Court (ICC), Ismail Haniyeh, Yoav Gallant, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Israel-Hamas war, Yahya Sinwar","
On May 20, Karim Khan, prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), announced that he has applied for arrest warrants for five Israeli and Hamas leaders. These include Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Minister of Defence Yoav Gallant. This dramatic development marks the first time leaders of a western allied state have been accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity at the ICC.
Along with an expert panel that independently reviewed the evidence supporting the application, Khan concluded there are reasonable grounds to believe Netanyahu and Gallant are criminally responsible for starvation, murder, intentional attacks against civilians, extermination and persecution, among other crimes.

Khan alleges these acts are part of a common plan “to use starvation as a method of war and other acts of violence,” both to achieve Israel’s war aims and to collectively punish the civilian population of Gaza. Under international law, the crime of starvation includes not only the deliberate deprivation of food, but also other objects indispensable to human survival including water, medicine and fuel.
The crimes alleged against Hamas leaders Yahya Sinwar, Mohammed Deif and Ismail Haniyeh include hostage taking, murder, torture, extermination and sexual violence committed while in the context of captivity, among others.





Canada does not recognize Palestine as a state, while the majority of United Nations members do. Because the State of Palestine is a member of the ICC, it has jurisdiction over crimes committed by Palestinians on any territory, as well as those committed on Palestinian territory, including by nationals of non-member states like Israel.

State responses
While many ICC member states, like France and Belgium, have reacted positively to the application, others have been more cryptic. Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany have all joined the United States and Israel — who are not members of the  ICC — in some version of the argument that issuing the warrants creates a false moral “equivalence” between Hamas and Israel.




      Read more:
      US hostility towards the ICC is nothing new – it supports the court only when it suits American interests




Canadian officials refused to say whether Canada would support the ICC’s work with respect to the case against Israeli leaders. Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly said whether Canada would agree to execute any eventual arrest warrants should Netanyahu or Gallant visit was a “hypothetical” question. 
While Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said that “Canada respects the independence” of the ICC, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the request indicates a “troubling… sense of equivalency between the democratically elected leaders of Israel and the bloodthirsty terrorists that lead up Hamas.”
Like all ICC member states, Canada is under a general legal obligation to co-operate fully with ICC investigations and prosecutions in accordance with the Rome Statute, which is the basis of the ICC’s authority. 
This doesn’t mean all member states must agree with every decision taken by the prosecutor in the exercise of his discretion, but it does imply that they refrain from actions that would frustrate the proper functioning of the ICC or deliberately contest its legitimacy.
The ICC has made clear member states don’t have discretion to “choose to co-operate with the Court … on the ground of a disagreement with the Court’s interpretation and application of the Statute.” 
Obligation of co-operation
While we are certain to see challenges to the ICC’s jurisdiction and admissibility brought by Israel, it is not for other members of the ICC to question the authority of its decisions. In the event that Canada were faced, for example, with a request to arrest Netanyahu, it would be obliged to co-operate.
Unlike in the case against Vladimir Putin, Khan has chosen to go public with his request for warrants before they were issued by the ICC. He has done so to encourage both Israeli and Hamas leaders to change course in this conflict, and to reinforce “that the lives of all human beings” — both Israeli and Palestinian — “have equal value.”

This was a risky decision because it opened the door for political criticism that will not be as readily available once the ICC has decided there are reasonable grounds to issue warrants. While the harsh responses of the U.S. and Israel were entirely predictable, that so many ICC member states have followed the same line of attack is worrisome. 
If and when arrest warrants are eventually issued, it would be wholly inappropriate for leaders of member states like Trudeau and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to continue to characterize the warrants as “unhelpful.” To do so would undermine the findings of the ICC, and would be inconsistent with states parties’ general obligation of co-operation.
Canadian response
Now — before the ICC decides on arrest warrants — is the time for the Canadian government to decide whether it will continue to support the work of the ICC as it promised to do in the motion that passed on March 18. 
Trudeau and Joly’s statements are inflammatory insofar as they rely on the racist and dehumanizing trope that contrasts western liberal civilization with the barbarous other. Their statements also encourage the position that crimes committed by a democratically elected government are less severe or blameworthy than crimes committed by non-state actors.
From the Allied atrocities during the Second World War through Vietnam and the so-called “war on terror,” history shows us that this simply isn’t true.
Under Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2015, Canada was the only member state to oppose Palestine joining the ICC because “‘Palestine’ is not recognized by Canada as a state.” 
Notwithstanding Canada’s recent abstention at the General Assembly on the question of Palestinian membership in the UN, it is now an open question whether Canada will oppose the ICC’s jurisdiction over the alleged crimes on the same basis. Given that the Court has already found that it has jurisdiction over territory occupied by Israel since 1967 for the purposes of the prosecutor’s investigation, as international law expert Tom Dannenbaum notes, such a challenge is unlikely to be successful.
Crucially, were Canada to contest the ICC’s jurisdiction after it issues arrest warrants, it wouldn’t be on the basis that reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli or Hamas leaders have committed international crimes were lacking. Instead, such a policy decision would rely on the premise that Palestinian lives are less worthy of protection than the lives of the nationals of other ICC member states.

"How Modi is using TV, film and social media to sway voters in Indiaâs election",https://theconversation.com/how-modi-is-using-tv-film-and-social-media-to-sway-voters-in-indias-election-230066,3014146,"Muslims, India, Podcast, WhatsApp, Bollywood, Narendra Modi, Islamophobia, BJP, Hindi, Hindu nationalism, Shah Rukh Khan, Hindutva, India elections, Indian film, Don't Call Me Resilient, 2024 Indian elections","
As the world’s largest electorate goes to the polls in India, political parties are seeking to sway voters through popular culture, like film. Although cinema has long reflected and influenced the country’s political and social cultures, right now, Bollywood (and other Indian films) are a major boon to the current right-wing government. 
Led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is currently gunning for a third term in office. 

First established as the political wing of the RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) — a paramilitary, volunteer organization — the BJP is one of two main political parties in India. The BJP believes that India, which is 80 per cent Hindu, is fundamentally a Hindu nation. Their platform has partly succeeded because of its widely appealing characterization of India as a post-colonial powerhouse. The opposition, The Indian National Congress, is a secular party. Last month, while campaigning, Prime Minister Modi delivered a speech that was widely criticized as Islamophobic.
On today’s Don’t Call Me Resilient podcast, political scientist Sikata Banerjee of the University of Victoria and cinema studies scholar Rakesh Sengupta of the University of Toronto, explain how cinema and social media operate to produce ideas that include “a vicious vocabulary of hate against minorities and dissenters” in India. All of which may be helping to sway voters.
“In Modi’s India, when people are asking these questions, why am I poor? Why am I feeling so worthless? The answer is always the Muslims,” says Banerjee. “The Muslims have taken away your wealth. They’re taking all the jobs…You see very clearly how Modi is getting people on board with this idea of the Hindu imagined community.” 
It is partly this message of Islamophobia, mixed with a modern Hindu pride, that has infiltrated Bollywood, the largest film industry in the world churning out approximately 1,500-2,000 stories a year. These films have helped to circulate ideas of a newly imagined and highly appealing, strong and victorious India. That storytelling is in part bolstered by streaming platforms and social media like YouTube and WhatsApp, which have an even bigger reach than Bollywood films. 
Some films, like last year’s breakout ‘Tollywood’ movie RRR, honoured at last year’s Oscars, retell history from the perspective of the current “victors.” Another recent example of a film accused of distorting history is Swatantra Veer Savarkar based on the life of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar, who developed the Hindu nationalist political ideology of Hindutva.

Sengupta at the University of Toronto says the relationship between cinema and state in India have always been historically intertwined. “You can always historically see a kind of reflection of the state of a particular time in the cinema of that time, he says. ""Under the current regime of Hindu nationalism, we are witnessing more and more and more films being made on Hindu pride and Muslim violence.”
Polls in India opened on April 19 and undergoes seven phases until it closes on June 1, 2024. Results are announced on June 4.

The UKâs coastal âghost enclavesâ are the result of government failure on low-use homes,https://theconversation.com/the-uks-coastal-ghost-enclaves-are-the-result-of-government-failure-on-low-use-homes-227743,3013881,"Affordable housing, Property market, Community, UK housing, UK housing market, Coastal communities, 2021 Census, UK housing crisis, Educate me","
The UK has long been in the middle of a housing crisis. And yet, across the country, the number of low-use homes is growing.
Housing experts like ourselves use the term “low-use” to refer both to unoccupied properties and to infrequently used second homes. 
Data from the 2021 census revealed 1.5 million unoccupied dwellings in England (6.1% of all dwellings) and 120,450 in Wales (8.2%). In Scotland, that figure stands at 90,700 unoccupied dwellings (3%), according to the National Records of Scotland (there is no comparable data for Northern Ireland).
This overlaps with the rising popularity of the short-term let market, in which Airbnb leads the charge. The census also showed that in certain popular coastal areas of England and Wales, one in ten homes are second homes, often used as holiday lets to help make ownership sustainable or profitable.





Low-use properties take units that might be available as long-term homes out of circulation. This shows up as a loss of properties to rent or buy, which in turn causes rents and house prices to rise, squeezing local purchases and renters out of the market. The more low-use properties there are in any given area, the more the impact on local community life can be devastating.
One of us (Jonathan Bourne) has developed a way to map the extent and value of low-use domestic property in England and Wales. We have used this methodology to prepare a new report on low-use housing in collaboration with the UK charities, abrdn Financial Fairness Trust and Action on Empty Homes. 
This research looks at the prevalence and impact of low-use housing for England, Wales and Scotland. Our map of what we’ve called “ghost enclaves” – the most concentrated areas of low-use properties – suggests that this is almost exclusively a coastal phenomenon. It effectively outlines the island of Great Britain in red.
The ‘ghost enclaves’ of Great Britain where at least 20% of properties are low-use:

Since 2022, we have gathered council tax data at what statisticians term “lower super output area” level. These are small areas containing between 400 and 1,200 housholds (or 1,000-3,000 people). Each approximates a community or neighbourhood unit. In England, there are just over 33,000 of these areas. 
Of the 371 local authorities (or equivalent) across England, Scotland and Wales, we got data from 205 – covering 64% of the population of the three nations. We found that large numbers of local authorities have areas in which 5% or more homes are low-use. In 50 of the 205 council areas we looked at, we also found ghost enclaves where at least 20% of properties – and as many as half in some areas – are empty or largely unoccupied. 
In the ghost enclaves that topped our ranking, low-use homes account for between 34% and 54% of the local housing stock. These areas include Trawsfynnydd and New Quay in Wales; St Ives, Padstow, Grasmere and Benthall in England; and Earlsferry and Millport in Scotland. 
Because of the way that short lets often include whole “primary” homes where people rent their home out part of the time, and second homes which are rented out, our analysis is likely to underestimate the full extent of the problem. Because of the potential to make money using these avenues in areas of high demand for tourist accommodation, we often find homes being tipped out of the homeowner and private rental markets into the holiday-let market. 
We also interviewed 66 experts and campaigners across the UK: housing and planning officials, policy experts, campaigners, residents, councillors and politicians at local and national levels, plus trade body representatives.
They described how second homes and short-term lets have hollowed out many communities. Demand for essential services like schools has reduced as a result. Year-round social infrastructure, such as pubs and cafes, has withered due to the outsized seasonal demand followed by long fallow periods. Communities feel significant resentment. 
Our findings chime with census data showing that Londoners are increasingly buying investment properties in the national parks and coastal areas of the south-west. Similarly, affluent households in the north-west of England are buying second homes in north Wales.
One planner we interviewed said any benefits from increasing housing development in rural areas (a policy that many support) – including releasing more land for housing and allowing rural exception sites, barn conversions and developments on small “pocket” sites (such as in a garden or between houses) – are essentially cancelled out by people turning existing stock into Airbnbs, holiday lets and second homes. “And we have no planning control over that,” one planner explained. They likened the whole exercise to filling the bath with the plug pulled out. 

Why the planning system needs to change
Our research shows how many areas have become sinks for investment cash. This money has often been generated by the rising wealth of homeowners privileged by the economic settings of recent decades – notably low interest rates, but also significant tax privileges for holiday lettings and landlords (though this is beginning to change). 
Small towns and villages have thus become places of both abundant investment wealth and social poverty. For local residents, house prices are too high and rental options are often non-existent. Over time, these communities are being pushed out.
Simply building more homes will not solve this problem. But there are ways for lenders and governments to rebalance the housing options and local economies in rural and coastal areas. 
First, lenders can team up with local authorities to share the live council tax data that shows those areas (just as we did) of concentrated low-use (above 5% of homes). This would help them to block further lending for investors, and instead focus on those who need homes to live in. In an exciting move, Leeds Building Society has duly announced a trial ban on holiday-let mortgages for parts of North Yorkshire and north Norfolk. 
Second, raising stamp duty rates on second dwellings in areas where there are more than 5% low-use properties would also slow investment purchasing, by raising the effective cost of second homes. Such a tax could help councils raise income that could be used to bring other empty homes into use, or to help other local affordable housing projects.
To make any viable solution work, though, the planning system needs to be altered. In all parts of the UK, a distinction needs to be made between primary residences, second homes and short-term lets. 
In England, a planning classification for short-term lets has been introduced, but another is needed for second homes. This would help the planning system to be an effective tool in preventing excessive concentrations of low-use properties. Introducing an effective licensing scheme (now in full operation in Barcelona and Amsterdam) for short-term lets would also help block what we might call the “airbnbification” of entire districts. 
Without urgent action, low-use properties and the UK’s ghost enclaves will remain symbols of a broken housing system that places vulnerable and low-income households at the mercy of an investor economy of quick gains and good holidays. Asset owners will continue to expand their portfolios – and pensions – while poorer households struggle even to find a home.

âWokeâ and âgaslightâ donât mean what you think they do â hereâs why thatâs a problem,https://theconversation.com/woke-and-gaslight-dont-mean-what-you-think-they-do-heres-why-thats-a-problem-230488,3013880,"Language, Words, Woke, Give me perspective","
Words and phrases change their meaning often as language evolves.
In the past, something was “awful” if it was amazing (think “awesome” or “awe-inspiring”). A “naughty” person was poor rather than poorly behaved. 
Only museum exhibitions could be curated, certainly not wardrobes, flats or social media pages. “Bimbo” meant “reckless man”, but is now a sexist word for a young woman, complicated by recent attempts to “reclaim” the term.
Some of these changes are benign, some more troubling. One worry is that when we have a precise term for something, and the meaning of this term changes, we might find ourselves unable to understand or communicate about whatever that thing is. To see why, it’s worth looking at three examples. 





It’s difficult to say what “woke” means. It’s used variously as a positive, neutral or negative word for someone who has socially liberal views, with a lot of disagreement about which views count. But it used to mean something much more precise. 
In the wake of the 1931 arrest of the Scottsboro Nine in the racially segregated US, blues singer Lead Belly told fellow African-Americans travelling through the area to “stay woke”, warning them to be aware of the pervasive threat of violent racism. From there, the term meant “alertness to racist injustice”.

The sociologist Arlie Hochschild coined “emotional labour” to mean the work that a person does in managing their own emotional state to provide a particular experience to others. For example, a waiter who remains friendly towards a rude patron performs emotional labour. 
It is now used much more broadly. Housework, supporting friends and organising social occasions have all been called “emotional labour”. A quick search of TikTok reveals how widely emotional labour is used in ways that depart from what Hochschild meant.
Another word that is commonly used these days is “gaslighting”. Based on the events of the play Gas Light by Patrick Hamilton, “gaslighting” is a specific kind of abuse whereby someone is made to doubt their own ability to know about the world. 
One person makes another doubt that what they perceive or remember is real to manipulate them. More recently, it is used to mean any kind of lying or disagreeing with someone.
Where’s the harm?
Language is a tool we use to understand and communicate the world. When we don’t have the words for something, it is difficult or impossible to properly understand that thing. 
As an example, the philosopher Miranda Fricker discusses the experience of Wendy Sanford. Sanford experienced postpartum depression following the birth of her son, but didn’t have the language to describe what she was going through. When she discovered the term “postpartum depression”, she came to understand her experience as a medical condition, where previously she had mistakenly understood it as a personal failing.

When precise terms change their meaning, we lose a tool for understanding and communicating about an idea or experience because the words that previously helped us to do this are no longer suitable. In my research, I call this process “hermeneutical disarmament”.
When “woke” just means “socially liberal”, Black speakers lose an effective way to communicate about being self-protectively aware of racist injustice. Simply talking about “alertness to injustice” will not do either. “Woke” communicates alertness to injustice as gaining consciousness, a radical change in a person’s perspective on the world.
Hochschild describes meeting workers who tell her that her research makes them feel seen, bringing to light an experience that was previously “invisible” by giving it a name. Changes to the meaning of “emotional labour” undermine these gains. 
A waiter who comes across the phrase “emotional labour” as meaning any emotionally draining work usually performed by women misses out on a tool for understanding the effort that she puts into managing her own emotional state for her a job.
When “gaslighting” just means “lying”, we lose a tool for talking about this specific form of abuse. This could have serious implications for victims of this abuse, and for practitioners and activists working in this area.
Hermeneutical disarmament looks straightforwardly bad. However, it is sometimes desirable to change our language.
Consider changes to the meaning of “marriage”. Before this legal status is extended to same-sex couples, the term “marriage” refers to a relationship that is highly esteemed but exclusively heterosexual. 
When same-sex marriage is legalised, we lose a term that presents heterosexual committed relationships as somehow superior to other committed romantic relationships. This represents a favourable linguistic change for people who are unjustly discriminated against.
Changes to language are hard to predict and even harder to control. So, it’s difficult to say what we can do to guard against the harmful instances. 
But some people do have more influence than others over the way that language develops. Journalists who write for a large audience and influential figures on social media (“influencers”) can introduce specialist terms to their readership, staying true to their original meaning or proposing a new definition.
When using the kind of precise terminology that matters here, journalists, social media influencers, and so on, should take care to use these terms by accurately representing their original meanings.

Ultrasound waves zapped at the brain are being used to treat everything from hand tremors to addiction,https://theconversation.com/ultrasound-waves-zapped-at-the-brain-are-being-used-to-treat-everything-from-hand-tremors-to-addiction-229654,3013879,"Neuroscience, Brain, Ultrasound, Educate me","
One in four people has a mental disorder, according to the World Health Organization. If you’re lucky enough to live in a wealthy country, treatment will usually involve some form of medication – which can cause more issues than it fixes.
The reason for that lies in the depths and complexities of the human mind. It is made up of a maze of pathways that connect the different parts of the brain. They are in turn governed by chemicals that dictate our thoughts, emotions and actions. When a person has psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety or addiction, this intricate landscape is often clouded in shadow.
Medicating as a form of treatment touches every part of that complex system, the areas you want to treat and everywhere else besides. However, research is uncovering a light at the end of this metaphorical tunnel – a technique that uses ultrasound to change how the brain behaves.
When people hear the term ultrasound, they probably think of the scans used to monitor the early development of babies in the womb. In that context, it works by emitting gentle waves of sound, and when they bounce off different parts of the body, they create “echoes” that are turned into a moving image.





The notion of using the same methods to modulate brain activity might sound like something out of a sci-fi novel. But it is grounded in solid scientific principles. 
Focused ultrasound involves the targeted delivery of sound waves to specific regions of the brain, where they can influence brain activity. And unlike other forms of brain stimulation, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation or deep-brain stimulation, the use of transcranial ultrasound stimulation (TUS) offers several distinct advantages.
For starters, it is non-invasive, meaning there’s no need for surgery or implantation of electrodes. The ultrasound machine is simply positioned onto the hair with gel and delivers ultrasound. 
This not only reduces the risk associated with invasive procedures, but also makes it more accessible to a wider range of patients. 
Also, focused ultrasound can precisely target deep brain structures with unprecedented accuracy, allowing for personalised interventions that address the root causes of brain disorders, whether neurological, like essential tremor or psychiatric, like addiction. 
This level of precision holds the promise of personalised medicine, where treatments can be tailored to individual patients based on their unique brain organisation and symptoms.

Vast and varied
The potential applications of focused ultrasound in treating brain disorders are vast and varied. Notably, one of the most remarkable findings is its ability to reduce tremors in individuals with essential tremor by targeting the deep brain regions responsible for excessive movement.
In depression, researchers have also explored its ability to change the activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex – a region of the brain that has been implicated in mood regulation. By gently nudging this area with ultrasound waves, scientists hope to alleviate symptoms of depression and restore balance to the brain’s emotional circuitry. 
Similarly, TUS shows promise in anxiety disorders, where aberrant activity in the amygdala – an almond-shaped structure involved in fear and stress responses – can contribute to pathological anxiety. By precisely targeting the amygdala, researchers aim to dial down its hyperactivity, offering relief to those plagued by incessant worry and dread.
Even more complex conditions like addiction, characterised by disruptions in reward sensitivity, cognition and social functioning, may benefit from TUS interventions. Some UK research teams are currently working on a trial looking at its potential to address alcohol addiction. By modulating activity in brain regions associated with reward, the hope is to mitigate the debilitating effects of the disorder and improve patients’ quality of life.

The complexity of psychiatric disorders poses another significant hurdle, and imagining this as a one-size-fits-all solution is perhaps fanciful. But this is a field where treatment options are limited and outcomes vary widely. Against that, the prospect of precise brain interventions that target the root causes of psychiatric disorders could revolutionise psychiatric care and offer hope to millions around the globe.
As the mysteries of the brain are continuously refined and technology can allow us to reach its deeper parts, there is hope that we will find ourselves on the brink of a new era in mental health care, where the shadows of psychiatric disorders are illuminated by the healing power of sound.

"Saltmarshes do store carbon, but their climate impact may have been overestimated",https://theconversation.com/saltmarshes-do-store-carbon-but-their-climate-impact-may-have-been-overestimated-230352,3013878,"Wetlands, Carbon sequestration, Peat, Salt marshes, Give me perspective","
Saltmarshes, or tidal marshes, are able to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and lock it away at a far higher rate than even forests on land.
This has lead to them being championed as a nature-based solution to climate change. However, our research suggests the role played by saltmarshes of the UK and north-west Europe more widely in reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere has been significantly overestimated.
The UK has bold climate targets, including an ambition to incorporate carbon stored in saltmarshes in its national greenhouse gas reporting, while also developing plans to fund marsh restoration by selling the carbon they store to those wanting to offset emissions elsewhere.
The foundation for these plans is the assumption that every year each square metre of saltmarsh soil traps about 245 grams of carbon. However, this is a global average value, largely based on the carbon-rich saltmarshes of Australia and coast of the Gulf of Mexico. These areas are warm so plants grow quickly and easily, which ultimately leads to lots of carbon going into the soil. 

This raises the question of whether saltmarshes in the cooler and less sunny UK can really trap and store as much carbon as those in the tropics. If the answer is no, what does this mean for the UK’s climate plans?





The UK’s reality
Over the past seven years, we have collected thousands of soil and vegetation samples from saltmarshes all over Scotland, England and Wales. To calculate the amount of carbon stored we used an elemental analysis machine, which burns the soil at high temperatures and detects which gases are released.

We estimate that these saltmarshes store 5.2 million tonnes of carbon. But, on average, they only trap around 111 grams of extra organic carbon in each square metre per year. This rate is much lower than the global saltmarsh average but similar to that of UK forests.
This difference between the UK and global carbon accumulation rates (111g v 245g per year) may sound small but would result in significant overestimation in a marsh’s ability to store carbon. 
For example, if we take Caerlaverock saltmarsh on the Solway Firth in Scotland, we estimate that each year 754 tonnes of carbon accumulates. If we use the global average carbon accumulation rate, this would increase to 2,339 tonnes of carbon, a 3x overestimation.
Saltmarsh covers 452km² of the UK coastline which is small in comparison to other hotpots for carbon capture and storage such as forests (32,500km² in the UK). This means less than 50,000 tonnes of carbon accumulate in saltmarshes each year (for context, the UK emits around 117 million tonnes of carbon per year).

Additionally, we found that around 30% of this carbon has floated in on the tides after originally being captured from the atmosphere by seaweed, plankton, and other marine life. A further – currently unknown – proportion of the carbon originates from plants that grew on dry land and have been washed down rivers and into marshes. This means that only a fraction of the 50,000 tonnes is directly taken from the atmosphere by the saltmarsh, further highlighting that they have only a small direct impact on the climate. 
Shifting the perspective
Our new estimates should lead to a policy shift, since the climate benefits of the new carbon accumulating in saltmarshes are tiny compared to the benefits of protecting the marshes (and their already-stored carbon) in the first place.
Creating new areas of saltmarsh can also protect the coast from erosion and provide new habitat for plants and animals. But a greater emphasis must be placed on preserving existing saltmarshes from threats like rising seas or coastal defences being built to protect farmland.
Given the size of the existing stock of carbon and the slower rate at which this increases, we emphasise the vital and urgent need to protect the carbon already locked in saltmarsh soils. The development of policy and management strategies to protect and preserve this carbon must now be a priority.

Bridgerton: must-know beauty tips for Regency ladies,https://theconversation.com/bridgerton-must-know-beauty-tips-for-regency-ladies-230615,3013877,"Beauty, Makeup, Bridgerton, Quarter Life, Educate me, Regency history","
We’ve all become accustomed to historical inaccuracies in period TV shows (including Bridgerton) but fans of Regency-inspired romance fantasy can’t seem to get over the modern beauty techniques on show. “Acrylic nails, fake lashes and ‘BOTOX’,” screams a recent headline in The Daily Mail.
Modern beauty magazines are full of tips and tricks to extend, enhance or conceal. Young ladies from the Regency era (1811-1820) were also interested in beauty advice, but their regimen was a bit different from ours.  
Across Europe, young ladies and their mothers were bombarded with beauty advice from physicians, perfumers and moralists alike. For early 19th-century debutantes, the heavy application of cosmetics, commonly associated with the mid-18th century, had become passé. A natural look was the hottest new beauty trend. 
True beauty, these ladies of the ton (fashionable society) were told, came from cleanliness, rather than in the make-up aisles of some 19th-century equivalent of Sephora or Boots.






Regency recipe and advice books typically included tips for skincare rather than cosmetics. Natural beauty, medical writers made clear, began with good health. Health came from regular exercise (walking or riding), moderation in diet and cleanliness. Clean skin had moral implications.
According to medical writers of the time, clear skin signalled good health, which in turn suggested potential fertility – a major preoccupation in the marriage mart. This emphasis on skin was set against the backdrop of high rates of venereal disease, particularly in London where an estimated 20% of the population contracted syphilis before the age of 35. Syphilis could be congenital, meaning that even a chaste young lady might be affected. Skin problems were a main symptom of syphilis.
There were other reasons for young women to avoid cosmetics. A popular advice manual, Mirror of the Graces, which was written under the pseudonym of A Lady of Distinction in 1811, identified two problems. Many face paints contained poisons, such as lead, which could ruin your skin or cause illness. But a painted face also made it difficult to see the truth of your mind and emotions, concealing as it did the subtle shifts in skin colour. 


No one’s 20s and 30s look the same. You might be saving for a mortgage or just struggling to pay rent. You could be swiping dating apps, or trying to understand childcare. No matter your current challenges, our Quarter Life series has articles to share in the group chat, or just to remind you that you’re not alone.

Big Mood is a gloriously exuberant comedy about navigating mental health in your 30s
I’ve researched Clara Bow – it’s no wonder the actress inspired Taylor Swift’s new album


Of the types of cosmetics available – lacquered lips, face powder, eyebrow colouring and rouge – only rouge was acceptable, and then only if a young woman was ill or anxious.
The Lady of Distinction offered “healthy” methods to encourage natural beauty. These could be made at home or by an apothecary, or even purchased at various shops. The recommended beauty treatments included hair and face washes; lip balms and creams; scented waters; treatments for blemishes, sunburns, tans or freckles; and methods of removing wrinkles or firming up the skin. The ingredients were not cheap, including things like spermaceti (wax from a sperm whale), benzoin (tree resin) and ambergris (waxy substance from the digestive system of sperm whales). The cost of natural beauty could be high.
Chapped hands? Paste of Palermo was a soap that smoothed and protected with its mixture of soap, salad oil (softening), lemon juice (extra lather), silver sand (exfoliating) and perfume (scent).
Sunburn from too much exercise? Try fard, a useful paste of sweet almonds, spermaceti and honey.
Dull skin from too many late nights? A water to give lustre to the face included wheat bran, eggs and ambergris.
Need rosy cheeks? Try virgin milk, a tincture of benzoin (a tree resin) and spirits of wine to pull the blood into your cheeks and make them rosy. It also smelled nice and could be used on pimples and other skin problems.

Lips dry and pale? This lip salve of marrow, spermaceti, raisins, alcanna root and balsam of Peru should soften them, while providing a vermilion tint.
Bridgerton, curiously, depicts the elite young ladies as wearing cosmetics (eye shadow and blush) and the prostitutes as clear-skinned and cosmetic-free. The reverse would have been true in Regency England, given that prostitutes were thought to have much to conceal: venereal disease and dissolute living. 
The light eye shadow (and strong-looking acrylic nails) worn by the young ladies in Bridgerton is not historically accurate, but may instead represent that they took particular care of their appearance. The lengthy skin care practices of the Regency period are challenging to capture on screen. The cleanliness of the prostitutes, however, suggests their own clean health status and the Bridgerton men’s relative safety in visiting them.
For Regency ladies, good skin was about much more than just skin-deep beauty. Good skin was a visible sign of one’s health, fertility and morals.

Womenâs sport and social media: the arguments over shared or separate accounts,https://theconversation.com/womens-sport-and-social-media-the-arguments-over-shared-or-separate-accounts-226571,3013876,"Social media, Sport, Football, Rugby, Equality, Instagram, Gender equality, Manchester City, Women's football, Women's sport, Lionesses, England cricket team, Women's rugby, Football Association, Social media role, Women's sports, Social media use, Social media trends, Give me perspective, Keep me on trend, X (formerly Twitter)","
Women’s sport has long battled for equal visibility in the media spotlight. But  social media has become a powerful tool for sportswomen and women’s sport to control their narratives and connect directly with fans. 
This has sparked debate among communication experts about whether men’s and women’s teams within the same sport, or even the same club or international side, should have separate social media accounts.
England Rugby is the latest team to split the social media accounts of their men’s and women’s teams. Earlier this year, the governing body established dedicated Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts for the Red Roses, the national women’s teams.  
The decision by England Rugby follows the Football Association’s move a little over a decade ago to create a distinct brand for England women’s team, the Lionesses. Some researchers have argued that referring to the team solely as “England women” reinforces the notion that the men’s team is the default, or the standard. 





The Lionesses moniker, with its connotations of strength and fearlessness, carves out a distinct identity for the women’s side.

      Why does the FA give the Lionesses less social media support than England's men? It needs to up its game for the Women’s World Cup




Traditionally, women’s sporting achievements have been either ignored or problematically portrayed. Sports sociologist Toni Bruce has highlighted how women have been positioned as “the other” in media narratives meaning they’re different or separate from the default of the men’s teams. 
But there are also arguments that traditional coverage for women’s sport is evolving, with a gradual increase in both quantity and quality.
Social media holds particular importance for women’s sports due to historical shortcomings. Decades of unequal coverage has prompted female athletes and teams to leverage social media. These platforms have helped foster greater visibility and reach for sportswomen, potentially leading to increased viewership for women’s sports.
Shared or separate accounts?
Proponents of shared accounts argue for a unified team identity. But questions remain over content parity. Shared accounts often raise questions about gender disparity, where women’s content is crowded out by men’s. 
For example, England Cricket at present only have one account to represent all of their teams. In 2018, Manchester City opted to merge their social media accounts during their The Same City, Same Passion campaign. At the time, the team noted the importance of a shared platform to harness visibility for women’s sport. But now they are using two separate accounts for Man City and Man City Women. 
The argument for separate social media accounts for men’s and women’s teams in the same sport is that it allows for a more targeted approach to engagement and content creation. But this comes with challenges because rebuilding a dedicated following and social media engagement from scratch take time, effort and resources.
Some notable examples of teams that have separate social media accounts include the USA women’s soccer team (USAWNT) and the Australian women’s cricket team. 
The case of USAWNT is particularly interesting. Media scholar Roxanne Coche has explored how the US federation presented the women’s team in comparison to the men’s team on X. She found that by using one account for both teams, the women were treated as a “niche” product while the men’s side received more coverage. 
Since splitting accounts, the USAWNT have amassed 2 million followers on Instagram and 2.4 million followers on X. While the men’s account has 2.3 million followers on X and three million on Instagram. 
The debate among experts is over whether separate accounts lead to a lack of exposure and visibility for the women’s teams, as they may not have the same reach as the men’s teams. On the other hand, having separate accounts reinforces the notion that men’s and women’s sports are separate entities, rather than being part of the same nation, team and sporting landscape. 
It appears that it is women’s teams which mostly have to create new platforms rather than the men’s. This reinforces the idea that men are the established group, while women are positioned as outsiders. Consequently, increasing the media work required by women creates an additional gendered burden. 

Red Roses
We kept track of the amount of social media followers the Red Roses England rugby team had before and after the 2024 Six Nations Championship. England Rugby had been the main account, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram and 1.1 million on X. 
One week before the start of the tournament, the Red Roses had 14,100 followers on Instagram and 2,600 followers on X. After the Six Nations had ended, the Red Roses had amassed 29,600 followers on Instagram and 5,200 followers on X. 
This demonstrates how tournaments are heightened periods of visibility. Splitting the account during this time was useful for the Red Roses. But it also demonstrates the huge disparity in the quantity of followers, subsequent visibility, and the time it takes to grow an online fan base. 
The effect of separate social media accounts extends beyond follower numbers. A dedicated platform allows teams like the Red Roses to take centre stage, freer to find an audience beyond a mere bolt on for men’s content. This focus can foster  a stronger brand identity and deeper fan connections, potentially leading to more positive long-term outcomes for women’s sports.

Why the upcoming South African election a massive milestone for the ruling ANC,https://theconversation.com/why-the-upcoming-south-african-election-a-massive-milestone-for-the-ruling-anc-230142,3013875,"South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Thabo Mbeki, Cyril Ramaphosa, African National Congress (ANC), Give me perspective, South African elections 2024","
South African’s governing party, the African National Congress (ANC), is in trouble. After 30 years in charge, it is scrambling for support ahead of the upcoming national elections.
The ANC has run the country since the end of apartheid in 1994, initially with Nelson Mandela as its leader. Crumbling infrastructure,  particularly to do with electricity supply, a growing lack of employment opportunities, and the perception of elite corruption  have all eroded the promise and the early nobility of Mandela’s emergence on to the South African government stage.
Even the current president, Cyril Ramaphosa, has had his own brush with corruption accusations. He was cleared of these, but his track record as someone able to turn South Africa around and help it find its feet once again towards economic progress and fairer distribution, has been hampered by massive infrastructure disintegration. Huge electricity blackouts and unreliable transport have affected domestic voters as well as the huge industries that depend on energy and getting their products to the coast for export, which has constrained South Africa’s economic growth. 
So, given all of that, in the elections coming on May 29 it seems for the first time that the ANC could lose its parliamentary majority. This is of great importance in that it is parliament that elects the president and therefore both the party and the president could be ousted. It will also be hugely symbolic for the country as the ANC has led this first period of democracy.





Figures who were once in the ANC, such as Julius Malema who leads the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), and former president Jacob Zuma who, while still an ANC member, has started a new party, uMkhonto weSizwe, named after the former paramilitary wing of the ANC, are playing a significant role in election campaigning. 

One argument being highlighted in the campaign is that industry control is even now, three decades after 1994, still in the hands of white corporate bosses – and there is much evidence this is the case. That message might stymie the parliamentary ambitions of the Democratic Alliance – which boasts an effective and efficient administration in the Western Cape, but has a senior leadership that is entirely white.
Some opinion polls have the ANC as low as 40% in voter support  And, although the ANC insists it is clawing back ground, there is no secret in Pretoria that overtures have been made to the EFF as to which portfolios in a coalition government would satisfy its ambitions.  Some feel Malema may demand the vice presidency as part of a deal.
Meanwhile, South Africa’s highest court has just ruled that Zuma cannot stand for parliament in the election. The court ruled that anyone convicted of an offence and sentenced to more than 12 months imprisonment cannot serve in the National Assembly, until five years after the completion of a sentence. 
Zuma was sentenced to a 15-month prison term in 2021 after he was found guilty of contempt of court for refusing to testify before a judicial commission. He was released after three months as part of a presidential remission programme.
The ANC has declined to pursue disciplining or expelling Zuma for forming a rival party. Not expelling him may be the first step towards a coalition after the elections.
ANC history
The celebrations of electoral victory by Mandela and the ANC in 1994 were shared by domestic and international well-wishers who had supported Mandela throughout his years of imprisonment.

But Mandela and the ANC faced formidable problems. They inherited a public administrative system used to serving only a small white population. One of Mandela’s first decisions was based on the realisation he could not trust the system and its personnel to deliver benefits to all. 
It meant the appointment of ANC personnel to key positions nationwide, not on the basis of capacity and ability, but loyalty. It meant many of the ANC’s reformative and distributive policies were never fully or well implemented, for lack of expertise.

      What happened to Nelson Mandela's South Africa? A new podcast series marks 30 years of post-apartheid democracy




Mandela had been in prison for close on three decades. He had never had any training or experience as a president. Deputy president Thabo Mbeki (1994-99) became the technical brains behind the government. When he succeeded Mandela as president in 1999 he brought to bear his international experience. His policy of Black Economic Empowerment  (later Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment) was derived from US policies of positive discrimination. It encouraged the creation of black firms which, all other things being equal, would be awarded municipal contracts. 
But many of the contracts, such as the construction of housing units, resulted in poorly planned and poorly built houses.. And bribery at municipal level began to burgeon as firms lobbied, and then paid, municipal administrators to award them the contracts.
When the internal politics of the ANC, an uneasy amalgam of those who had stayed to resist apartheid underground, or who had been imprisoned, and those who had left, either to fight or organise international support, led to the downfall of Mbeki and his replacement by Zuma, things started to go badly wrong. 
The presidency of Zuma, a man who had never had his own bank account, led to the beginnings of a discernible economic downturn and saw also municipal corruption grow into national corruption. Under Zuma, “state capture”, such as the plundering of state-owned organisations and nationalised industries by cronies of the president, and his appointment of unqualified people to run huge national and international operations led to a growing sense that South Africa had lost the promise it once held. 
In effect the much-trumpeted legacy of Mandela of an end to white domination and the creation of a new South Africa is far from complete. And 2024 probably marks a historic lurch towards a coalition government – something very different to the past, but also one that might be able to refresh South Africa’s reputation.

How Detroit techno is preserving the cityâs beating heart in the face of gentrification,https://theconversation.com/how-detroit-techno-is-preserving-the-citys-beating-heart-in-the-face-of-gentrification-228590,3013874,"Music, Detroit, Community, Gentrification, Dancing, Techno, Local, House music, electronic dance music","
For over two decades, Detroit has celebrated its status as the birthplace of techno with an electronic music festival held over Memorial Day weekend.
But like the city around it, the festival has changed. At its inception, the event was free and focused on techno music and Detroit musicians, primarily the Black Americans who started techno – just as house music was developing in Chicago – in the mid-1980s. Now, the price of a weekend ticket is US$309, plus a $46.15 service fee. And some festivalgoers have noted it no longer draws as many Black attendees as it once did or as one would expect, given the racial makeup of the city. It has long since dropped “Detroit” from its name, rebranding as the Movement Electronic Music Festival in 2006.
In short, to many Detroiters, the annual festival has gentrified, as have the central corridors of the city.
As an ethnographic researcher of Detroit techno – and a self-confessed “househead” – I have watched as the city and its music have changed as more and more Black Detroiters have been forced out by rising rents. But I have also seen how the city’s underground music scene is fighting back by preserving community in the face of spatial injustice – that is, the unfair allocation of resources in a mixed society – and the pressures of systematic racism.





One such space of resistance happens every Thursday during the summer at The Congregation, a cafe built in a former church located one block from the epicenter of Detroit’s 1967 rebellion – which saw days of confrontation between police and predominantly Black residents.
At The Congregation, a grassy dance floor draws an intergenerational and diverse crowd. The event keeps the spirit of old Detroit alive, while offering newcomers a vision of what a truly inclusive city can look like. 

Techno is Black music (from Detroit)
Detroit is known universally as the birthplace of techno. The genre emerged in the 1980s, when the Rust Belt city was experiencing white flight, widespread disinvestment and the consequences of postwar government programs, such as urban renewal and highway building, that were destructive to community needs.
As one techno musician from back in those days told me, techno was the soundtrack they heard in their head while walking, and looking over a shoulder, in mostly abandoned downtown streets.
Techno emerged from two interrelated scenes: Black, gay clubs and the Black high school party scene, where people, some too young to drink, organized elaborate events with professional light shows and sound systems. 
Meanwhile, inspiration and encouragement also came from the music being played by the Electrifying Mojo, a radio DJ whose nightly show demonstrated Detroit’s wide range of musical tastes, from Parliament to Peter Frampton to the B52s, and, later, techno and house.
The diversity of influences and do-it-yourself attitude of techno pioneers such as Juan Atkins, Eddie Fowlkes, Derrick May and Kevin Saunderson resulted in a form of music that is both funky and futuristic, even some 40 years later. The purpose of Detroit techno was, and still is, to make you dance, to make you sweat; it distinguishes itself from other dance music by its characteristic layered rhythms, abstract sounds and Afrofuturistic themes.

Detroit techno was always rooted in strong community bonds – especially within Detroit’s Black community – despite the city being ravaged by disinvestment.
Since the 1980s, many of the forms of electronic dance music that were inspired by Detroit and Chicago have gained mainstream popularity in Europe and white America.
But in the face of what some critics have labeled the “whitewashing” of the electronic music industry – and the disproportionate profits made by white DJs and promoters – it is important to credit the Black Detroiters behind techno. And projects such as Detroit’s Exhibit 3000, the world’s first museum dedicated to techno, which opened in 2004, help promote the city’s role in developing electronic music.
In return, the Detroit techno and house scene helps maintain a sense of community and support for Detroiters who have long faced systemic racism in the city, and are now encountering gentrification.
Gentrification’s threat to culture
The changes in Detroit over the past 15 years have been disorienting and have had negative consequences for many longtime Black Detroiters.
Seniors have been evicted, sometimes with little notice, from downtown buildings, which are then redeveloped into high-end apartments out of the financial reach of many Detroiters. 

Meanwhile, traditionally Black neighborhoods are suffering in contrast to the booming downtown core,  where white residency increased by 115% from 2000 to 2020.
Gentrification is a danger to Detroit’s underground music community, too. Not only is it making residential and commercial spaces unaffordable for longtime residents, but cultural communities are also threatened. 
The high school party scene that incubated techno was possible because there was so much downtown space in 1980s Detroit. That space has been squeezed by gentrification.
‘Are you going to The Congregation?’
In response to the squeeze of gentrification, Detroit’s underground music scene has kept vibrant by creating spaces for weekly pop-up events.
I attended the very first house night at The Congregation in the summer of 2020. With a large, grassy front yard, it was perfect for social-distanced dancing during the pandemic. The three resident DJs who host the event – Marvin Prather, John Spears and Tony Dennis – are lifelong Detroiters who bring in guest DJs, including Eddie Fowlkes, who helped originate Detroit techno.
Over the four years of its existence, house night at The Congregation has become a gathering place for people who were part of the 1980s techno scene – predominantly Black Detroiters now in their 50s and 60s.
I find it remarkable that the community has maintained these connections over the decades, and that the dancers and DJs who were there from the beginning still draw inspiration from their participation.
Yet it’s a welcoming, inclusive community that incorporates newcomers – just as it did when I first moved to Detroit from California in 1998. 
It is, simultaneously, a homecoming with a family cookout vibe, a great place for a weekly catch-up or a banger to work up a sweat dancing.
Midway through one such evening last summer, a young Black woman near me on the dance floor shouted with surprise, “Dad! Dad! Dad!” and then walked along the fence to greet a Black man, perhaps a bit older than me. The fact that both attended the event – and were happily surprised to see each other there – demonstrates the way in which Detroit’s music scene continues to bring generations together. And The Congregation is just one such venue. On any given night, the regular crowds at the four main dance music venues in Detroit are likely to be diverse in races, ethnicities, sexualities and – in contrast to the norm in electronic music events worldwide – age.
During the final record played on the last Thursday event of summer 2023, one of the DJs, Taz, acted as MC and asked the crowd to take out their phones as another DJ, Mark Duncan, was playing “Flashlight” by Parliament.

Many in the crowd shined their phone flashlights as they danced and sang along.
That sense of community is what makes events such as those that take place at The Congregation something that househeads like myself miss from summer to summer – and fear might be edged out completely in the face of gentrification.
I am counting down the days until it begins this year on June 6. In a gentrifying city, spaces like The Congregation represent both continuity and an honoring of all that have come before: the Black people who created techno and house, the Detroiters who didn’t leave a disinvested city, and the fierce creativity that remains one of the city’s main draws.

Our research reveals the scale of the EUâs dependency on imports for critical minerals needed for the green transition - hereâs how that can change,https://theconversation.com/our-research-reveals-the-scale-of-the-eus-dependency-on-imports-for-critical-minerals-needed-for-the-green-transition-heres-how-that-can-change-230244,3013747,"Climate change, Mining, European Union (EU), Recycling, Lithium, Raw materials, The Conversation Europe, climate transition","
The climate transition is a materials transition. Decades of international diplomacy around oil, gas and pipelines are now giving way to conversations around the supply of critical raw materials. And not before time: to meet the EU’s energy and climate targets, we need to build the right technologies, in the right quantities, at the right speed. The problem is that many of these technologies are built with materials imported from just a handful of countries.
Critical raw materials are defined as those materials which have significant economic importance and are exposed to a high supply risk, often because of a high concentration of supply from a few third countries.
Demand for these precious resources is expected to increase exponentially in the coming years, not just in the EU, but around the world. This will increase global competition just as the EU’s own needs soar. Against this backdrop, preparedness is crucial.
On 23 May, the EU’s Critical Raw Materials Act came into force. The Act is a first attempt to provide Europeans with a regulatory bedrock to develop domestic resources, diversify sourcing and strengthen the resilience of supply chains and the circularity of critical raw materials in the EU, all while striving to ensure the highest social and environmental standards. 





The new rules outline three goals for the EU’s annual consumption of raw materials: 10% are to originate from local extraction, 40% to be processed in the bloc and 25% to come from recycled materials. The act also claims that no more than 65% of a given mineral can be sourced from a single non-EU country. As a sign of urgency, the Act was adopted in record time – only eight months from its original publication.

Demand for rare earths for clean energy technologies to increase fivefold by 2030
In our work at the EU’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), we showed that in the case of many of the strategic clean energy technologies, the bloc is entirely dependent on single sources – most often China – for raw materials, and also for other segments of the value chain. Our finding that demand for rare earths will increase fivefold by 2030 to satisfy our wind turbine needs alone, was quoted by President von der Leyen when she announced the Commission’s intention to introduce the Critical Raw Materials Act.
The proposed Act was published last year alongside our comprehensive forecast on critical materials supply chains and demand. Our study analyses the supply chains of 15 technologies crucial to achieving the green and digital transitions and the EU’s defence and space agenda, across five key sectors: renewables, electromobility, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), industry and aerospace & defence. The study also helped to establish the concept of strategic raw materials, and the list of materials it encompasses. Strategic raw materials fulfil some additional criteria: they are key to technologies which are strategic for the EU’s energy and digital transition and its security goals; their demand is forecast to increase rapidly, perhaps outstripping supply; options for substitution are limited; and scaling up production is difficult.
Unprecedented demand and concentration of supply
The study shows a rapid, multi-fold increase in the demand for the critical raw materials which are key to the EU’s green, digital and security goals. The EU relies heavily on imports for these materials. In fact, for raw materials supply, the EU share in global production is never higher than 7%.
For example, while the EU is a global leader in wind turbine production, it is fully dependent on China for the permanent magnets and the rare earth elements used in them. China is also the major world supplier for crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic cells and modules, the main technology that will be deployed to achieve the almost fivefold increase in the EU’s solar PV capacity by 2030.
Raw materials are also key for hydrogen electrolysers, especially as the bloc’s plan to wean itself off Russian energy imports by 2027, REPowerEU, requires a tenfold increase in electrolyser manufacturing capacity in Europe by 2025. Global shortages in materials such as iridium loom in the 2020s and 2030s, as supply is unlikely to keep pace with demand unless significant actions are taken.
We predict a rapid increase in demand for critical raw materials not only in the EU but also in all regions of the world, precipitating competition for them across countries and sectors. For example, compared to 2020, lithium demand for batteries in the EU is expected to grow 12 times as large in 2030 and 21 times as large in 2050. Globally, the surge with respect to 2020 is 18 times in 2030 and 90 times in 2050. 
A similar pattern is found for graphite (natural and synthetic), which is used for components of solar and wind industries and batteries. Demand is expected to increase 14 times by 2030 and 26 times by 2050, compared to 2020. 
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst
In addition, the Covid-19 crisis, the Suez Canal obstruction in 2021 and the 2020-2023 global microchips shortages have also reminded us of our supply chains’ vulnerability.

Figure 1 shows global shares in production for materials and key components in the main renewable energy technologies. It also shows how dependencies propagate downstream in the value chain, extending from raw materials to components and to the final products, and how complicated it is to deal with these dependencies in an integrated way. The dominant role of China raises concerns not only about the competitiveness of EU industry but also increases the risk of supply disruptions, thus constituting an important geopolitical risk.
Propagation of dependencies along the value chain
The EU needs to monitor the supply disruption risk and to prepare for these events. Or, as Stephen King said, “we can hope for the best for as long as we are prepared for the worst”.
The Act requires that stress tests are carried out for the supply chain of each strategic raw material at least every three years. These are what-if scenarios, analysing the potential impact of severe supply disruption events and the way supply chains would react. The EU and its Member States would need to know, for example, what sectors would be affected by a potential disruption in the supply of a particular material, what shortages or price spikes might follow, and the cascading effects of those. Such stress tests are not unusual in other sectors such as banking and energy supply, and can provide useful insights into the resilience of supply chains.
Innovation and substitution with advanced materials
Anticipation is key to getting this right. New production and processing capacities take time to develop. While we don’t have good alternative materials yet, research and innovation in advanced materials is of paramount importance both to the EU’s autonomy and to its global leadership.
In fact, energy is one of the key research and innovation priorities identified in a Communication on advanced materials supply for industry published by the Commission in February this year. 
Advanced materials can help by decreasing production costs, increasing efficiency, and making production more sustainable (for instance by using lower amounts of critical raw materials). 
At the JRC we are looking closely at the gap between demand and innovation, with a particular focus on high-impact areas and supply chain resilience. We find that advanced materials can be good for innovation and substitution in many clean energy technologies, but they often face barriers to widespread adoption. We need to ensure that more efficient, sustainable alternatives reach the market faster.
Optimising the properties and composition of materials is already helping reduce – and could even eliminate – cobalt and nickel from electric-vehicle batteries, and possibly even replacing lithium with sodium. It could also mean a steady reduction of rare-earth content in permanent magnets for wind turbine generators. And new chemical solvents for carbon dioxide capture would offer improved environmental and operational performance.

Parliament was in the middle of discussing some very important laws before the election was called â what happens to them now?,https://theconversation.com/parliament-was-in-the-middle-of-discussing-some-very-important-laws-before-the-election-was-called-what-happens-to-them-now-230746,3013746,"UK politics, UK parliament, Legislation, UK election 2024","
Just hours before Rishi Sunak fired the starting gun for the 2024 general election, the House of Commons was in full flow, listening to treasury minister Bim Afolami announce that inflation has fallen, and firing questions at the prime minister. 
Now, parliament will end just as it is working through a raft of legislation, including the criminal justice bill, the finance bill and a bill to clear the names of hundreds of people wrongly convicted in the Post Office scandal. The UK’s electoral system makes it difficult for governments to clear the decks, particularly if, like yesterday, the announcement of an election comes as a surprise. 
Parliament will be prorogued (meetings will be discontinued) on Friday May 24. The bills that have been passed in the current session will be announced in a statement made in the House of Lords, before parliament is formally dissolved a few days later. This will mark the end of the parliament elected in 2019, and trigger the 25-working-day election campaign period. 
From this point on, the 650 MPs currently sitting in the House of Commons will no longer be MPs. More than 100 have so far announced that they will be standing down. The rest will return to their constituencies as candidates seeking re-election, hoping that they will be back sitting on the green benches of the Commons in just a few weeks. 





But first, two days of parliamentary “wash-up” will commence in which the government will try to pass as much unfinished legislation as it can. And Sunak’s government has a lot of legislation to choose from: 16 government bills are currently making their way through parliament. Any or all of these bills could potentially pass. 
The government will want to be strategic and ensure that potentially vote-winning legislation hits the statute book before the official campaign begins. Some, like the data protection and digital information bill, are further along than others.

      UK election called for 4 July – what happens next?




The Labour frontbench was quick to announce that it would do “whatever is necessary” to pass the victims and prisoners bill, which includes a new compensation scheme for those affected by the infected blood scandal. This was confirmed by leader of the House of Commons Penny Mordaunt, who told the House that the bill would be considered by MPs on Friday.   
Mordaunt’s statement confirmed that the tobacco and vapes bill which aims to make England smoke free by 2030 would not make the cut. This is a surprise given the amount of publicity that the legislation has had this year – and it would have been a handy success story for the Conservatives in the campaign. We can expect this to be a big feature of the Conservative party’s election manifesto instead. Labour has also said it would introduce the ban in if elected.
The Post Office offences bill should make it though, along with the victims and prisoners bill. There was no mention in Mordaunt’s statement today of the wide-ranging criminal justice bill or the renters reform bill. Both were expected to be controversial in later stages, so are highly unlikely to be a priority in the wash-up period.

Dangers of rapid scrutiny
Parliament’s scrutiny of legislation is usually slow and cumbersome, with bills going through a series of stages and many hours, even weeks, of debate either on in the Commons and Lords chambers or in the committee rooms. To pass so much legislation quickly, the government will work through the “usual channels”, a term which essentially means that government and opposition whips (or business managers) will negotiate behind the scenes to decide which legislation (or bits of legislation) will be successful. 
Mordaunt confirmed to MPs on Wednesday evening that these discussions had started. Bills will be discussed very quickly on Thursday and Friday so that they can pass through their remaining stages, receive royal assent from the king and become law. On the last day of wash-up before the 2010 general election, six bills passed, including the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act which was pushed through its final stages in a matter of minutes. 
Some see this period as crucial to ensure an efficient end to the legislative process and to make sure that valuable legislation is not lost. All bills which do not come out of the wash-up period as acts of parliament will fall, and cannot be carried over to the next parliament. 
The wash-up period also ensures that the many hours of parliamentary time spent discussing legislation has not been futile. The victims and prisoners bill, for instance, has been on the books since March last year.
For others, it shows just what is wrong with parliament. Legislation which completes its stages in a matter of minutes is not legislation that is well-scrutinised. It increases the chances for laws to be badly written, perhaps with unintended consequences. It also gives the opposition in the Commons and the House of Lords a bit more clout than they would ordinarily have, as they can try to veto any bits of legislation that they disagree with.

"Hurricane forecast points to a dangerous 2024 Atlantic season, with La NiÃ±a and a persistently warm ocean teaming up to power fierce storms",https://theconversation.com/hurricane-forecast-points-to-a-dangerous-2024-atlantic-season-with-la-nina-and-a-persistently-warm-ocean-teaming-up-to-power-fierce-storms-228351,3013681,"Climate change, ENSO, La Nina, Extreme weather, El Nino, Hurricanes, Atlantic Ocean, El Niño Southern Oscillation, Atlantic hurricane season, Ocean heating","
The 2024 Atlantic hurricane season starts on June 1, and forecasters are predicting an exceptionally active season.
If the National Hurricane Center’s early forecast, released May 23, is right, the North Atlantic could see 17 to 25 named storms, eight to 13 hurricanes, and four to seven major hurricanes by the end of November. That’s the highest number of named storms in any NOAA preseason forecast.
Other forecasts for the season have been just as intense. Colorado State University’s early outlook, released in April, predicted an average of 23 named storms, 11 hurricanes and five major hurricanes. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts anticipates 21 named storms.

Colorado State also forecasts a whopping 210 accumulated cyclone energy units for 2024, and NOAA forecasts the second-highest ACE on record. Accumulated cyclone energy is a score for how active a given season is by combining intensity and duration of all storms occurring within a given season. Anything over 103 is considered above normal.
These outlooks place the 2024 season in league with 2020, when so many tropical cyclones formed in the Atlantic that they exhausted the usual list of storm names: A record 30 named storms, 13 hurricanes and six major hurricanes formed that year, combining for 245 accumulated cyclone energy units.
So, what makes for a highly active Atlantic hurricane season?
I am a climate scientist who has worked on seasonal hurricane outlooks and examined how climate change affects our ability to predict hurricanes. Forecasters and climatologists look for two main clues when assessing the risks from upcoming Atlantic hurricane seasons: a warm tropical Atlantic Ocean and a cool tropical eastern Pacific Ocean.
Warm Atlantic water can fuel hurricanes
During the summer, the Atlantic Ocean warms up, resulting in generally favorable conditions for hurricanes to form.
Warm ocean surface water – about 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 degrees Celsius) and above – provides increasing heat energy, or latent heat, that is released through evaporation. That latent heat triggers an upward motion, helping form clusters of storm clouds and the rotating circulation that can bring these storm together to form rainbands around a vortex.

Ocean heat in 2024 is a big reason why forecasters are warning of a busy hurricane season. 
The North Atlantic sea surface temperature has been shattering heat records for most of the past year, so temperatures are starting out high already and are expected to remain high during the summer. Globally, ocean temperatures have been rising as the planet warms. 
A long-term temperature pattern known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, or AMO, also comes into play. The summer Atlantic ocean surface can be warmer or cooler than usual for several seasons in a row, sometimes lasing decades.

Warm phases of the AMO mean more energy for hurricanes, while cold phases help suppress hurricane activity by increasing trade wind strength and vertical wind shear. The Atlantic Ocean has been in a warm phase AMO since 1995, which has coincided with an era of highly active Atlantic hurricane seasons.
How the Pacific can interfere with Atlantic storms
It might seem odd to look to the Pacific for clues about Atlantic hurricanes, but Pacific Ocean temperatures also play an important role in the winds that can affect hurricanes.
Like the Atlantic, water temperatures in the eastern Pacific oscillate between warm and cold phases, but on shorter time spans. Scientists call this the El Niño Southern Oscillation, or ENSO. The warm phases are known as El Niño; cold phases are called La Niña.
La Niña promotes the upward motion of air over the Atlantic, which fuels deeper rain clouds and more intense rainfall. 


La Niña’s effects also weaken the trade winds, reducing vertical wind shear. Vertical wind shear, a difference in wind strength and direction between the upper atmosphere and the atmosphere near Earth’s surface, makes it harder for hurricanes to form and can pull apart a storm’s vortex. 
In contrast, El Niño promotes stronger trade winds, increasing wind shear. It also centers the upward motion and rainfall in the Pacific, triggering a downward motion that promotes fair weather over the Atlantic.

El Niño was strong during the winter of 2023-24, but it was expected to dissipate by June, meaning less wind shear to keep hurricanes in check. La Niña conditions are likely by late summer.
Where ENSO is in its transition may determine how early in the season tropical storms form – and how late. A quick transition to La Niña may indicate an early start to the season as well as a longer season, as La Niña – along with a warm Atlantic – maintains a hurricane-friendly environment earlier and longer within the year.
This ocean tag team controls hurricane activity
The Atlantic and eastern Pacific ocean temperatures together control Atlantic hurricane activity. This is like bouncing in a bounce house or on a trampoline. You get a good bounce when you’re jumping on your own but reach far greater heights when you have one or two more people jumping with you.
When the eastern Pacific is in its cold phase (La Niña) and the Atlantic waters are warm, Atlantic hurricane activity tends to be more frequent, with a higher likelihood of more intense and longer-lived storms. 
The record 2020 hurricane season had the influence of both La Niña and high Atlantic ocean temperatures, and that’s what forecasters expect to see in 2024.

It is also important to remember that storms can also intensify under moderately unfavorable environments as long as there is a warm ocean to fuel them. For example, the storm that eventually became Hurricane Dorian in 2019 was surrounded by dry air as it headed into the Caribbean, but it rapidly intensified into an extremely destructive Category 5 hurricane over the Bahamas.
This article has been updated with NOAA officials describing the forecast as the highest number of storms it has ever forecast.

African Standby Force turns 20: has it helped keep the peace? The pros and cons,https://theconversation.com/african-standby-force-turns-20-has-it-helped-keep-the-peace-the-pros-and-cons-228649,3013446,"Peacekeeping, Mozambique, East African Community, Peace and Security, Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), Southern African Development Community (SADC), African Standby Force, AU Peace and Security Council, Eastern DRC, African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), African Union","
It’s been 20 years since the African Standby Force was established by the African Union (AU). The standby force is mandated to implement the AU’s right to intervene in African situations that require military force. This year, the AU is reviewing the force’s successes and failures.
Cedric de Coning and Andrew E. Yaw Tchie, who have studied the evolving nature of African-led peace operations, provide an overview of the standby force and where it fits in the continent’s security architecture.
1. Why was the African Standby Force established?
The AU adopted the African Standby Force’s policy framework in 2004. The force was envisaged as one of the core elements of the African Peace and Security Architecture, which includes, among other bodies, the Peace and Security Council.
The African Standby Force was established to enable the Peace and Security Council to deploy peace support operations to prevent, manage or help resolve crisis situations. 





The AU’s peace and security protocol also envisages enforcement operations in response to war crimes, crimes against humanity, serious abuses of human rights and genocide. Most of the peace operations undertaken by African institutions have been to support host states to deal with armed insurgencies or stabilise political transitions. To date, the AU hasn’t authorised such an enforcement operation yet.
The standby force’s original concept aimed for multidimensional forces (that is, civilian, police and military components) stationed in their countries of origin and ready for rapid deployment. Five regional brigade-sized standby forces were established, one each in east, west, central, north and southern Africa. Each brigade has about 5,000 members for an overall strength of 25,000 personnel. 
The standby force was declared fully operational in 2016. In 2017, the force’s capabilities were used to plan and deploy an Economic Community of West African States mission to The Gambia, while the Southern African Development Community (SADC) deployed a mission to Lesotho. More recently, the SADC deployed missions to Mozambique in 2021 and to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2024, both in line with the African Standby Force framework. Likewise, the East African Community deployed a regional force to restore stability in eastern DRC in 2022.
The AU – through its eight regional economic communities and other institutions – has deployed 27 peace operations since the African Standby Force was established. However, neither the Peace and Security Council nor African member states have used the standby arrangements as originally envisaged.  
What has affected the deployment of the African Standby Force?
Time has shown that three unfounded assumptions underpinned the AU’s original conception of how the African Standby Force would work.
First, it assumed that the Peace and Security Council, as the continent’s highest organ responsible for peace and security, would initiate deployment of the standby force. However, many of the peace operations deployed over the past 20 years were initiated or led by the eight regional economic communities, or by groups of member states that formed a coalition of the willing. 
One of the reasons for this is that most interventions require member states to approve the use of their armed forces and to take on some deployment costs. A decision to deploy a state’s armed forces outside its borders usually requires government commitment and approval. 
For example, the host country participated in approving the decision to deploy the SADC mission to Mozambique in 2021, as did all the other countries involved. The Peace and Security Council endorsed the deployment, providing the operation with additional political credibility  and access to AU logistical equipment and support. 
There is, therefore, a need for the African Standby Force to be adapted to the way member states take decisions to deploy peace operations. It needs to reflect states’ need to participate directly in decision-making processes and at the highest levels.
The second assumption was that the five AU regions – east, central, north, southern and west – would be the most appropriate structures to develop the African Standby Force. This made political sense as these five regions are used to elect members of various AU bodies. However, this isn’t a good model for a continental standby arrangement. 
This is because, first, several conflicts have occurred on the borders of two regional communities. It has, therefore, made more sense to involve the countries with a stake in the conflict, rather than one of the regional communities. Second, not all members of a regional community are equally affected by a conflict. Typically, those geographically closest to it have sufficient interest in the conflict’s management or resolution, and would be willing to contribute to a peace support operation. Further, very few African countries have the strategic airlift capability to sustain their forces if they were deployed far away. 
The third assumption was that establishing standby forces and keeping them ready for action would enable rapid deployments. In theory, this makes sense. In reality, neither the African Union, European Union nor the United Nations has used any standby forces that they have tried to establish over the years. 
The reason this hasn’t worked is that each conflict is unique. It requires a specific coalition of states that have a stake in managing the conflict to come together to contain spillover effects. 
What needs to change?
A military-heavy approach to peace operations is inadequate to deal with the multifaceted challenges that arise with conflict. These operations should be guided by comprehensive political strategies. They should draw on multidimensional capabilities and have flexible (just-in-time) standby arrangements. They need adequate financing, support and smart partnership arrangements.
Overall, however, because of the African Standby Force, the continent has a common peace support operation project. Before it, the continent was divided. Armed forces were trained in the peace operations doctrine of choice of their international partners. Now the AU peace support operations doctrine serves the continental peace and security architecture. 
Additionally, as a result of the standby force, Africa has developed significant peace operations capabilities over the past 20 years. For example, African troop-contributing countries currently provide around half of all UN peacekeepers. There are African missions deployed in Somalia, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Mozambique, eastern DRC and the Lake Chad Basin. The African Standby Force project has contributed to generating the African capabilities required for these operations. 
It’s therefore important to revitalise and reconceptualise the force so that it continues to perform its enabling and unifying role in support of the African Peace and Security Architecture into the future.

South Africa: Gold mine pollution is poisoning Sowetoâs water and soil â study finds food gardens are at risk,https://theconversation.com/south-africa-gold-mine-pollution-is-poisoning-sowetos-water-and-soil-study-finds-food-gardens-are-at-risk-229775,3013445,"Pollution, Uranium, Zinc, Lead, Copper, Arsenic, Peace and Security, Cobalt, Acid mine drainage","
For 140 years, gold mines in Johannesburg, South Africa have been leaking wastewater contaminated with heavy metals. The acid mine drainage from Johannesburg’s estimated 278 abandoned mines and 200 mine dumps includes uranium (a radioactive metal), toxic arsenic, copper, cobalt, nickel, lead and zinc.  Acid mine drainage can pollute land and water sources up to 20 kilometres away from a mine unless it is remediated by mining companies. The contamination cascades through food webs and poisons river water, plants and animals.
Before 1994 in South Africa, African communities were forcibly relocated to places near mine dumps in Soweto, south-west of Johannesburg. Today, Soweto is home to 1.9 million people who are exposed to acid mine drainage.
Fellow environmental scientists Salerwe Mosebi, Khayalethu Ntushelo and I researched how acid mine drainage affects urban agriculture in Soweto. Residents of the area rely on their small vegetable gardens to supplement their income and help meet their nutritional needs.

      Acid drainage: the global environmental crisis you’ve never heard of









Our research found that acid mine drainage has contaminated the streams, irrigation water sources and subsequently, the soil on the land adjacent to the Klip River, which flows south and west of Soweto.
In very mild doses, exposure to the heavy metals in acid mine drainage can cause dehydration and abdominal pain. In cases of serious exposure, birth defects, brain damage, cancer and miscarriages can result.
Mining companies are supposed to keep money aside to rehabilitate the environment after they close, and can only close down once government has granted a closure certificate. But this did not always happen in the past.
The authorities, both government and mining companies, should appreciate the seriousness of the situation so that they can do something about it. Strategies could include chemical treatment of the water and construction of wetlands along the rivers. Wetland plants can soak up large quantities of contaminants, such as heavy metals.
What we found
We took samples from river sediment, river water, borehole water, and cultivated and uncultivated soil in vegetable gardens all along the Klip River. We also took samples of spinach leaves in the gardens. 

We ran a variety of tests using different approaches, to see whether microbes or microscopic organisms, which can be bacteria, viruses or fungi, had been adversely affected by acid mine drainage. 
The results showed extreme toxicity near the mine dumps at abandoned mines (the source of acid mine drainage). People living closest to these sites were the most affected. 
Bacteria are the most robust and hardy forms of life yet the sites we tested were found to be unlivable for all life. Microbes were unable to survive the levels of contamination.
Our findings provide compelling evidence that acid mine drainage is indeed detrimental to the microbial community. It could be disrupting the delicate microbial networks that are so important for a healthy environment.
How does this pollution affect Soweto residents?
Soweto residents are affected by the mine dumps, toxic dust and the polluted land and rivers. I grew up in Tladi, Soweto, very close to the Klip River. My friends and I used to play in the river, and cross it on makeshift and precarious stone bridges to get to church and shops on the other side. We were oblivious to the danger of acid mine drainage at the time. 
Today artisanal miners, locally known “zama-zamas” (meaning “we try! we try!”) are re-mining the dumps. They are extremely exposed to the heavy metals because they handle the acid mine drainage, often without any protective clothing.  
In the last 20 years, government has offered some incentives to mining companies to pump away the acid mine drainage so that it is not continuously leaking into Soweto’s rivers and streams. 
However, our study found that this is simply not enough. The residents to the north of Soweto’s Dobsonville, Diepkloof and Meadowlands neighbourhoods live almost on top of mine dumps and they are most affected.

Our research found that soil from uncultivated fields in Soweto was more toxic than soil from the cultivated fields. This is because crops in the cultivated fields are irrigated with more healthy borehole water, which originates underground. It is possible that this borehole water dilutes the metal concentrations and reduces contamination in cultivated soil. 
This means that farmers will need to irrigate with tap or borehole water, rather than river water. This is costly and less convenient for small farmers living along the river.

People who live along the Klip River are also at risk of being exposed to heavy metals. We also found that the rest of Soweto’s residents are very vulnerable to heavy metal dust that is blown around during strong winds.
We hope the government will take steps to safeguard people in Soweto affected by acid mine drainage. This will help ease the burden on an already strained public health sector now and in the future. 
The abandoned mines should be lawfully decommissioned. People living very close to the mine dumps must be relocated, and a rehabilitation programme must be implemented to sustain urban agriculture.

How do I plan for my retirement? Step one ,https://theconversation.com/how-do-i-plan-for-my-retirement-step-one-start-right-away-230553,3013444,"Life expectancy, financial planning, Retirement, pension funds, Personal finance, retirement planning","
Planning for retirement is important because it will help you build the nest egg you’ll need to financially sustain your retirement years. 
Past studies have shown that those who plan for their retirement are more likely to be better off at retirement compared to those don’t. 
The sooner the planning process gets underway, the better. This gives your money more time to grow by generating investment returns. And the income from your first job is your first opportunity to save for retirement. As the saying goes: “The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” 
As people can expect to live longer, they must save more for retirement so that they don’t outlive their savings. This is particularly true given that the pensions landscape worldwide has undergone some major changes. 





In the past, governments and employers provided retirement income for individuals through government social security benefits and employment-based retirement funds. Because of increasing life expectancies, pension plans that guaranteed a retirement benefit to employees are now rare. Employees are now responsible for making contributions towards their own pensions as well as choosing the investments offered by the pension fund. 
Since employers are no longer responsible for funding their employees’ retirement and governments lack resources to provide a universal state pension, each person is ultimately responsible for ensuring they have enough retirement savings. So it’s very important to know the basics of the retirement planning process. 
As a researcher, I’m interested in how people use financial products to overcome economic challenges and build wealth. One of the things I investigate is whether planning for retirement leads to better retirement outcomes. For instance, my research has found that individuals whose financial affairs are in order are more likely to maintain their standard of living at retirement.
Given that everyone’s financial situation is unique, it’s always a good idea to speak to a financial planner for tailored financial advice. 
If you haven’t given retirement planning much thought or don’t know where to start, here are four points to help get the ball rolling.
What are my retirement goals?
Retirement goals make you think about what you want to achieve by the time you retire and what you need to do to achieve it. Some people may have a goal in mind about when they want to retire, or how much wealth they’d like to have by the time they retire. And since wealth has different meanings for different people, others may think about maintaining or improving their standard of living at retirement. 
Once you’ve thought about your retirement goals, the “smart” goals framework is a useful guide. It outlines that goals should be: specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound. 
When goals are clear, within reach, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive, they become a blueprint to help you turn them into a reality.  
How do I start saving for retirement?
For those who have a job that comes with retirement fund membership, a workplace pension is used to provide for retirement. But there are also other options available to help you save. 
For instance, retirement annuity funds are voluntary retirement savings. Personal assets such as unit trusts or tax-free investments can also be used as a savings tool. Unit trusts are generally better suited for people willing to take on risk because their value is tied to the movements of financial markets. In other words, they can generate positive returns but they can also lose value. The drawback of tax-free investments in South Africa is that they have a lifetime contribution limit. You can’t use them to save more than R500,000 (US$27,400).   
Each of these options has its advantages and disadvantages and what works best for one person may not be best for another. But there are several ways to save for retirement depending on your financial situation and retirement goals. Getting professional advice will help you determine what’s best for you. 
Will my retirement savings be enough?
Once you’ve set your retirement goals and have a retirement savings plan in place, you can calculate whether you are saving enough to achieve your retirement goals.  
For example, if your retirement goal is: “I want to retire at the age of 65 years with an income equivalent to R35,000 (US$1,900) per month” then you can use a retirement calculator to track your progress and determine whether you need to make adjustments to meet your goals. 
You might have to increase the monthly amount you’re putting away for retirement or reconsider your retirement age. The retirement calculators are also a useful tool for regular check-ins on your progress should your financial situation change – for example, if you change employers and earn a different salary. 
What other issues should I consider?
It’s also important to think about your lifestyle and priorities. 
For instance:

do you aim to retire with your mortgage settled?
are there debts you plan to clear before you retire or children who need financial support at retirement?
would you like to renovate your home?
would you like to buy a new car when you reach retirement age? 

Another important consideration is healthcare costs. Many people assume that they will be able to work indefinitely and overlook the fact that healthcare costs may increase with age. 
Starting early matters
Many people plan to work after retirement age, while others don’t plan to retire at all. It may be that they can’t afford to. They may have accessed their retirement benefits too soon, made inconsistent retirement fund contributions, or had to pay high administrative costs that eroded the final value of a retirement payout.
So best be prepared. Retirement may seem like a distant event to plan and save for, especially when there are more pressing financial needs. It’s important to think about the financial decisions you make now that may cost you in the future. If you start to plan for your retirement now, your future self will thank you for it.

Election 2024: Rishi Sunak has already lost control of the narrative,https://theconversation.com/election-2024-rishi-sunak-has-already-lost-control-of-the-narrative-230737,3013301,"UK politics, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that a general election will take place on Thursday July 4. Over the course of the next six weeks, therefore, he and Labour leader Keir Starmer will pit their parties, themselves, and their stories, against each other. 
But the 2024 general election may prove unprecedented in the relative anonymity of the political leaders. It is being fought by two especially distant political leaders, who have struggled to create, let alone communicate, an engaging personal story. 
Both Sunak and Starmer are often accused of being boring. And even though personality is a central force in governing, Sunak has often criticised “personality politics” as petty. He rarely talks about himself unless he absolutely has to.
For all Sunak’s talk of an election being a choice between who you can and can’t trust, it is telling that Sunak and Starmer’s statements at the calling of the election referred so little to themselves personally.
A message, drowned out
The importance of narrative, and the danger of not having one, was clear even as Sunak announced the date of the election. Standing in the pouring rain, struggling to be heard over the noise of a nearby protester playing Things Can Only Get Better – a song most readily associated with Tony Blair’s 1997 election win – Sunak was visibly rattled. The narrative was already a negative one – wet costume, bad setting and an unwelcome soundtrack. 
Sunak could have improvised, and it’s telling that he didn’t. He could have doubled down on the song’s message and repurposed it to his own ends. He could have acknowledged it and used it to criticise his opposition. This moment may stand as a lasting metaphor for Sunak’s failure to grasp the narrative and the initiative.

Sign up for our new, weekly UK politics newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.

Sunak must now choose an election narrative. His strategy may be to fight this election with self-awareness, using an “underdog” story (considering his party’s weak position in the polls). It may be to double down on the message that “the plan is working”. Either way, he urgently needs to counter the narrative of decline that has flourished during his leadership. 
Starmer faces the same choices. It was around this time last year that he finally started making headway in reclaiming his own personal narrative and pushing his working-class credentials to the fore.
In using terms like “Sir Softy”, and branding Starmer as a “north London virtue-signaling lawyer”, we have seen signs that Sunak wants to undermine Starmer’s working-class credentials, and turn Starmer’s own personal story against him.
However, there is arguably less pressure on Starmer to deliver a strong personal story than there is on Sunak. As psephologist John Curtice pointed out on BBC Radio 5 Live: “Starmer’s task is to hang on to the support the party has.”
Narrative control, narrative chaos
However Sunak and Starmer choose to present themselves, the timing of the election is likely to reinforce the air of resignation (figuratively and literally) for the Tories, and for Sunak himself.
Timing is part of the personal narrative, too, and a surprise announcement of an election in just a few weeks does not fit with Sunak’s aspiration to present himself as a safe pair of hands.  
The Guardian’s snap verdict was that: “Sunak made no attempt to explain why he is calling it for 4 July … There was no real need for an explanation, but it would have been nice to have one.” I agree – and I think it would have also been “nice” for the Tories to have one. Sunak has missed a chance to seize the narrative by saying exactly why he has made a decision that is so unexpected to so many people.
At worst, this will actively go against Sunak’s personal story, and with it, his “brand”. As Sky News chief political correspondent Jon Craig put it:  “A prime minister with a reputation for caution and an obsession with spreadsheets is actually a gambler.” This should not be treated as a throwaway comment. Sunak’s persona is one of calm, methodical, informed decision-making. This chimes well with the Tory narrative of sensible, sound planning, especially in economic matters. 

Playing the gambler for one day is a risky strategy for a man who lives by these rules, especially when he is seeking to portray his rival as unpredictable. In his speech calling the election, Sunak said of Starmer: 

He has shown time and time again that he will take the easy way out and do anything to get power. If he was happy to abandon all the promises he made to become leader leader once he got the job, how can you know that he won’t do exactly the same thing if he were to become prime minister?

The current prime minister must be careful that the same logic doesn’t end up being applied to him.

The US has always had âbig governmentâ â even in the Colonial era,https://theconversation.com/the-us-has-always-had-big-government-even-in-the-colonial-era-228490,3013163,"Economics, Markets, Government, Capitalism, Small government, Free markets, Political philosophy, republicanism, Thomas Jefferson, Social contract, George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, John Adams, American Founders, Colonial America, 18th century","
Paralyzed by its most radical members, the House of Representatives passed just 27 bills that became law in 2023 — down nearly 90% from the previous year. Republicans who see big government as a threat to liberty view this failure as a “success.” 
The idea of small government, however, is a myth at odds with U.S. history. In our new book, “How Government Built America,” we explore the extent to which the U.S. government has intervened in markets since the Colonial era. It turns out the country has always had big government.
Big government, 18th-century style
Small-government advocates claim that the idea of limited government is foundational to the United States. But the Founding Fathers – including the ones who appear on today’s US$1 and $10 bills – called for the new government to intervene in markets. 
Consider the situation in the late 18th century. After the U.S. won independence from Great Britain, two political groups – the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists – struggled to divide power between the federal and state governments. 





While the Federalists favored a strong national government – which the Anti-Federalists opposed – both sides agreed that government should have a substantial role in the new nation. The Anti-Federalists weren’t opposed to strong government, but they wanted to keep it at the local level.
The Federalists, including Alexander Hamilton, George Washington and John Adams, won out. They led the federal government’s efforts to manage the economy and invest in infrastructure, including the building of canals, bridges and roads. To this day, the federal government makes similar investments to promote prosperity.
Thomas Jefferson and other Anti-Federalists did believe that a powerful centralized federal government was more likely to be corrupted than if government were kept local. In his inaugural address, Jefferson called for “a wise and frugal Government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement.”
But Jefferson didn’t campaign against the widespread regulatory activities that were taking place at the state level. At the time, almost every aspect of early American economy and society, from Sunday observance to the operation of taverns, was regulated by the states, and, before them, the colonies. This was “big” government.
Jefferson, like other founders, was influenced by a political philosophy, republicanism – not to be confused with today’s Republican Party – which understands the furtherance of the public good as a key goal of good government. These lowercase republicans put the government in charge of organizing economic and social activity. 
Some of that government, Jefferson conceded, had to be at a national level. As president, he supported key elements of the national government established by the Federalists, including the national bank.
Three centuries of big government
A similar pattern has played out throughout American history. Markets produced an Industrial Revolution during the 1800s, but they also introduced dangerous workplaces, products, slums and poverty, which restricted individual opportunity and threatened people’s lives. The federal government responded by taking over from the states, for the first time, the function of regulating consumer markets, including railroad regulation, antitrust enforcement and food and drug safety.
And when market freedom led to the Great Depression of 1929-1939, it was government that restored economic opportunity and helped people to live and work in the meantime. 
More recently, when Wall Street crashed the economy in the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, government had to act again to restore markets. When COVID-19 hit, government hastened the development of vaccines and thus the restoration of people’s freedom to live and work.
A question of values
We believe the myth of small government not only goes against the realities of American history, but it also threatens the basic political values of the country. It has taken both markets and government to build a country truer to American values of liberty, equality, fairness and the common good.
Take liberty, for example. Markets are celebrated for promoting individual liberty when individuals purchase a car, start a business and make countless other market decisions. According to this understanding, market participants are free to make their own choices, and as they do so, markets build wealth and prosperity for the country. 
The internet revolution is a good example. Consumers have endless choices of programming, software, podcasts and other social media as entrepreneurs seek their attention and business. 
But as history shows, markets can also limit the liberty of consumers and workers, and when this happens, the public interest is not served. Consider how the internet can threaten the safety and well-being of children.
The U.S. can shrink its government, as its most determined political opponents demand, but history shows that the dangers markets pose will not go away. For example, the world is facing the “existential threat” of climate change – a problem that can’t be solved with free markets alone.
The exact mix of government and markets has been contested throughout American history, and preference for “small” government is a perennial campaign theme. But the idea that the country is best served by “big markets” unsupervised by “big” government, as far-right House members insist, ignores centuries of American history.

Calls for divestment from apartheid South Africa gave todayâs pro-Palestinian student activists a blueprint to follow,https://theconversation.com/calls-for-divestment-from-apartheid-south-africa-gave-todays-pro-palestinian-student-activists-a-blueprint-to-follow-229591,3013162,"Policing, Israel, Activism, Gaza, South Africa, Vietnam War, Anti-Apartheid Movement, University endowments, University divestment, Philanthropy and nonprofits, Global divestment movement, Higher ed attainment, Campus protests, 2024 campus protests, BDS movement","
In recent weeks, college campuses across the U.S. have been roiled by pro-Palestinian protests, with the police called in to arrest demonstrators and students threatened with expulsion.  
But there’s nothing unusual about the protesters’ tactics of taking over university buildings and erecting tent encampments on college lawns and quads.
These students, whose actions build on years of organizing spearheaded by the Students for Justice in Palestine, are part of a long history of radical student organizing. 
There are echoes of both the protests against the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s and, more recently, of South African apartheid in the 1980s. 





In the 1980s, U.S. student activists worked to make higher education “South Africa Free.” They urged institutions of higher learning to commit to divest all assets held in endowments that were tied to doing business in or with South Africa.
Over the past 10 years, I’ve researched and written about these Black-led anti-apartheid movements, with a particular focus on student campaigns. 
By calling out complicity on the part of colleges, corporations and the government in South Africa’s system of apartheid, student activists were able to show that demands for divestment could be a concrete and effective form of protest.
A movement decades in the making
Apartheid was a racist and exploitative project that white South African officials had developed over decades. 
Segregationist laws and land seizure policies created a captive, impoverished Black population, whose exploitation and disenfranchisement supported the economic prosperity of the governing white minority.
Originally, the idea to push for the sale of assets tied to corporations doing business in South Africa stemmed from the directives of the South African liberation movements, which called for a total economic, cultural and diplomatic boycott of the country’s white minority government.
The foremost South African liberation movements were the African National Congress, formed in 1912, and the Pan Africanist Congress, established in 1959. The South African government banned both organizations in 1960, forcing organizers to build their movements in exile.

In response, anti-apartheid organizers around the world developed creative ways to heed the call. 
In the late 1960s, for example, U.S. students targeted U.S. banks that lent to the South African government, calling them “partner[s] in apartheid.”
And the Students for a Democratic Society and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee coordinated a sit-in at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York City in 1965.
Following the 1976 Soweto uprising, in which South African police massacred at least 150 children, some U.S. workers began to demand that their pension funds be “South Africa Free,” and students at U.S. colleges and universities organized some of the first protests calling for the divestment of their schools’ endowments. 
The 1977 formation of the Committee to Oppose Bank Loans to South Africa made economic withdrawal a centerpiece of the U.S. anti-apartheid movement, one that grew stronger both on and off campus in the decade that followed.
Calls for divestment grow
At its climax in 1985 and 1986, protests for total economic isolation of South Africa surfaced at more than 200 colleges and universities across the U.S.  
Whether they were enrolled at historically Black colleges and universities, liberal arts colleges, Ivy League schools or public universities, students coordinated a national divestment movement, pushing the issue of U.S. investment in South Africa to the center of American intellectual and civic life. 
Student organizing formed the militant grassroots basis for the U.S. anti-apartheid movement and contributed to the economic, political and cultural isolation of South Africa’s violent and repressive white minority regime.

Students assembled blockades, organized “sit-outs,” occupied buildings and built “shantytowns” – made to resemble the makeshift dwellings in which many Black South Africans lived under apartheid – at more than 100 universities.
These shantytown protests marked the culmination of nearly a decade of campus anti-apartheid organizing. Thousands of students at hundreds of campuses erected encampments to try to “stop business as usual,” as student groups put it.
Persistence pays off
At schools across the country, university administrators ordered police to dismantle the shantytowns.
University backlash ended up only amplifying support for the movement as media flocked to the shantytowns, while faculty, parents and alumni rallied around the students.
Students, in turn, rebuilt their encampments. Joining them were supporters from beyond the university: musicians, politicians, and New Left and Black Power activists. The presence of feminist political activist Angela Davis, counterculture activist Mario Savio, poet June Jordan, writer Amiri Baraka and Pan-Africanism organizer Kwame Ture helped draw further national attention to student demands.
The highly publicized determination of the students helped turn the tide of public opinion. Founded by Black organizers Randall Robinson, Mary Frances Berry, Eleanor Holmes Norton and Walter Fauntroy, the Free South Africa Movement – working closely with the foreign policy advocacy organization TransAfrica – led hundreds of students and everyday people in a picket outside the South African Embassy in Washington, D.C. 

Many of the activists and student protesters were arrested. But by calling out specific corporations doing business in South Africa and popularizing corporate ties to anti-Black violence, oppression and massacres in a foreign country, students succeeded in making investments in those stocks riskier and unattractive. 
After two years of sustained militant organizing and demonstrations, the student anti-apartheid movement claimed to have gotten colleges and universities to divest about US$3.6 billion – or $10.3 billion in today’s dollars – from their endowments.
Revisionist history
In 1990, after 27 years of imprisonment, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela was released from prison.
By then, South Africa’s system of apartheid was crumbling. The reinstatement of the liberation movements in 1990, the repeal of segregationist laws in 1991 and the first democratic election of 1994 signaled the official end of apartheid, though discrimination and inequality persist in South Africa to this day.
In the collective memory of the U.S., anti-Vietnam and anti-apartheid movements are generally seen as righteous struggles that U.S. institutions couldn’t help but get behind.
Perhaps that’s why, after the death of Mandela in 2013, the University of California, Berkeley, administration claimed to be at the forefront of student divestment protests for South Africa.
This was revisionist history. 
In fact, at Berkeley and across many campuses, administrators called the police on protesters, threatened to revoke their scholarships, took others to court and ordered custodial staff to demolish the shanties.
Past as present
Activists, scholars and even former U.S. President Jimmy Carter have drawn comparisons between South African apartheid and Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. Many Palestinians refer to the 440-mile (708 km) separation barrier that Israel erected along the Gaza Strip as the “Wall of Apartheid.” 
Still, there are some notable differences between the two movements.
Divestment is trickier today because financial instruments are more complex than they were in the 1980s, in part due to the outsourcing of their management to investment firms and hedge funds. The size of many university endowments have also grown exponentially since then.
Nonetheless, I believe divestment from companies doing business with Israel is still possible – and can be an effective demand. Several college administrations have agreed to consider divestment, including Brown University, Northwestern University, Evergreen State College and the University of Minnesota.  
The U.S. anti-apartheid movement of the 1980s helped topple South Africa’s apartheid government. Back then, campus anti-apartheid occupations placed students at the forefront of changing the national consensus on U.S. complicity with injustice in South Africa. 
Time will tell whether today’s students can do the same with regards to Israel’s systematic oppression of the Palestinian people.

"Militia extremists, kicked off Facebook again, are regaining comfort in public view",https://theconversation.com/militia-extremists-kicked-off-facebook-again-are-regaining-comfort-in-public-view-230356,3013161,"Facebook, Social media, Extremism, Online extremism, White nationalism, Social media and democracy, Militia movement, Militias, militia organizations, Social media and society, January 6 US Capitol attack, white extremism, Militia groups","
When journalists sounded alarm bells in early May 2024 that more than 100 extremist militia groups had been organizing and communicating on Facebook, it wasn’t the first time militias had garnered attention for their online activities.
As a scholar of militias, I’ve seen extremists get kicked off Facebook before. 
This time, the platform’s moderators took down roughly 100 pages and profiles for violating the social media network’s rules that prohibit “militarized social movements.” 
These organizations include U.S. domestic militias, which are usually groups of armed people who meet regularly for shooting practice as well as discussions of cultural and political concerns. They also take personal responsibility for defending their communities and their country from a variety of perceived possible threats.





Some militias seek to defend themselves from the government, while others prepare to attack it – but all prioritize preserving Second Amendment rights and believe that they are protecting democracy from government tyranny that would otherwise be unchecked.
The 100 groups most recently removed are just a tiny fraction of the thousands of militia groups Facebook has previously kicked off the site, supposedly permanently. But it is nonetheless a concern that militias appear to be trying to reclaim the platform to network, recruit and publicize their activities. 
Caught unprepared
In the months before the 2020 presidential election, Facebook blocked and removed the Facebook profiles and pages of about 10,000 militia groups and militia members. The company fully deleted the groups’ comments and interactions, including on topics that had nothing to do with militia activity. 
For researchers like me, this was an eerie time. When I went on Facebook, it seemed as though those people and organizations had never existed. I’d studied them for decades, and they were just gone – even from the pages I created to monitor their activities. 
Facebook had long been the primary place online where militias could chat with other militias, learning about their preferred tools and techniques, and, in some cases, plotting violent action. Most militia groups at the time had publicly accessible pages for their units and openly discussed many of their actions, though the most nefarious operated behind private or invite-only groups that researchers and law enforcement were not always able to access. 
Militias like to think of themselves as being prepared for any eventuality, whether a natural disaster, a foreign government incursion or a more commonplace emergency like a car crash. But it became apparent that most of these groups had no meaningful backup plan for what they would do if they lost access to Facebook, the social media site where most of them were most active.
Some members tried to regroup on a variety of other platforms. But without a clear plan for doing so, they had trouble reconnecting with each other after Facebook shut their profiles down. This action, which scholars call “deplatforming,” was, in my view, the single most disruptive event in the militia movement’s history because of how dramatically and rapidly it disrupted the movement’s ability to coordinate across state lines.

A radicalization opportunity
Deplatforming can have downsides. People who are most aggrieved by perceived government actions or cultural conditions are those who are most motivated to find each other online. So Facebook was a collection point and meeting place for these people, increasing opportunities for individuals to become radicalized and potentially violent.
As they have been driven off Facebook and other platforms, many of them have moved to platforms that are more difficult for researchers and police to monitor for signals of emerging threats. That’s one downside.
In addition, the experience of being kicked off Facebook may have been a radicalizing moment for some. Some militia members I follow interpreted their deplatforming as further proof of their perceived oppression. Some of them argued that it was a violation of their First Amendment rights – though private companies are not bound by those legal standards.
My research has also found that many of these militia members never actually left Facebook. I personally observed them almost immediately creating new accounts. They seemed to be blocked from doing so only if they used the name or email address associated with their previous, deplatformed account. 
With different names and email addresses to hide behind, these same people have remained active on Facebook since 2020. Most who evaded permanent deplatforming through such name modifications are not among those who were kicked off in the most recent purge. So far, they have chosen to remain under the radar rather than openly reclaiming a militia affiliation. 
Comfort in public
Groups that have reclaimed a militia identity on Facebook appear to include groups previously kicked off, some of whom use their earlier unit names, and some of whom have rebranded, as well as new groups with people who had not publicly identified as militia members before the 2020 clear-out.
The fact that groups were openly operating with militia-related names on Facebook in 2024 means they are testing the platform’s moderation efforts. And it signals they are becoming more comfortable being visible, public entities. 
That’s despite the increased public scrutiny that has followed criminal convictions of militia members for their involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and a militia plot in 2020 to kidnap Michigan’s governor.
These apparent militia efforts to reclaim Facebook as a semi-public platform mimic efforts by militias in places like Virginia to openly organize, recruit and participate in politics. Together, they serve as a reminder that militia members’ underlying concerns and beliefs have not disappeared in the past four years and are instead primed for potential calls to action as 2024’s electoral season continues.
During his term, President Donald Trump regularly appealed to fears that militia members share. His actions included both direct calls for the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” and more subtle but nevertheless derogatory references to immigrants, transgender people and other purported threats to American culture. Militia efforts to resurface into public view indicates that members feel both a legitimacy and an urgency for action as the 2024 election approaches. 
While researchers like me are not currently expecting another large-scale event like the Capitol incursion, we are very much on edge regarding the possible coordination around state and local politics, especially those directly connected to the electoral process and outcomes.

Board of Education, Plessy v. Ferguson","
When the U.S. Supreme Court issues opinions, you may hear that the nine justices reached a 6-3 or a 5-4 decision. You may also hear that certain justices wrote a concurrence or that there were multiple dissents.  
Those concurrences and dissents are where Supreme Court justices express disagreement with the majority opinion.
Consider the recent case of Arizona v. Navajo Nation, which examined the Navajo Nation’s water rights in the Colorado River. The court decided 5-4 in favor of Arizona, meaning five justices agreed with the arguments made by the state of Arizona, while four justices agreed with the arguments made by the Navajo Nation.  
The opinion issued by the five justices is the decision that serves as precedent for other courts. It is referred to as the “majority opinion” or simply “the opinion.” 





The opinion issued by the other four justices is called “the dissenting opinion” or simply “the dissent.” Just as the majority opinion outlines its reasoning and how it reached its conclusion, the dissenting opinion will do the same. Lower courts are required to follow the majority opinion; lower courts are not required to follow the dissenting opinion.
Why issue a dissent if courts are not required to follow it? Dissents have a role and purpose even if they are not the official guide for a court’s decision.

For the record
Justices write dissents for the sake of history, for their personal reputation or as a matter of principle. They want to be on the record for why they believe the majority decision is incorrect.  
In the dissent, justices may go step by step through the majority opinion to highlight what they view as errors in the logic, interpretation or holding of the case. The holding is the court’s official answer to the question it is being asked to decide.
You can see an example of this step-by-step approach in the record of the case that overturned federal protection for the right to get an abortion, Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health. In that case, the dissent wrote detailed responses to the majority opinion.
Develop the legal argument
A dissent also has a role in helping other justices articulate their arguments.  
Before the court issues an opinion, the justices meet in person to discuss their views and their preliminary decisions on the outcome of the case. 
Based on that conference, the justices have an idea of what the majority opinion will be and who will agree with it. The chief justice, or else the most senior justice, then assigns one justice to draft the majority opinion. The same process is used in assigning one justice to draft the dissenting opinion.
These draft opinions are then circulated among all the justices, who provide comments and feedback about points they feel are important to incorporate. This review process helps justices decide whether to join an opinion or to write their own if they feel a certain point needs to be addressed.  
The value of this process is to hone the arguments in the opinions. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a 2009 speech that “there is nothing better than an impressive dissent to lead the author of the majority opinion to refine and clarify her initial circulation.”  
Dissents as guidance
Sometimes the reasoning in a dissent is used to adjust future law. It may serve as guidance to lawmakers, or it may form the basis for future cases designed to eventually overturn this initial case.  
In Plessy v. Ferguson, a case from 1896 challenging a racial segregation law in Louisiana, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation was legal as long as separate but equal facilities and services were available. 
There was only one dissent in that case, by Justice John Marshall Harlan. In the dissent, Justice Harlan argued that segregation was unconstitutional: “[t]he arbitrary separation of citizens on the basis of race while they are on a public highway is a badge of servitude wholly inconsistent with the civil freedom and the equality before the law established by the Constitution. It cannot be justified upon any legal grounds.”
Harlan’s dissent laid the groundwork for the argument ultimately accepted by the court 60 years later, in Brown v. Board of Education, that overturned the Plessy decision and declared racial segregation to be unconstitutional. 
Although Harlan is not explicitly mentioned in the Brown decision, the reasoning and arguments he articulated in the Plessy dissent formed the basis for subsequent cases that tested the limits of “separate but equal” and ultimately led the court to overturn that doctrine in Brown.
The dissent is not limited to one opinion. This means that in a 5-4 decision there could theoretically be four separate dissenting opinions. 
What about concurrences?

At least five justices must agree with, and sign on to, the majority’s decision. The simplest outcome is when those five justices all agree on a single opinion. 
However, a justice in the majority may still disagree with the writing in the majority opinion. For example, a justice may write an additional opinion clarifying the extent of agreement with the majority’s decision. Or a justice may agree with the majority’s decision but not the reasoning and thus choose to write a separate opinion. 
These separate opinions by those in agreement with the majority decision are called “concurrences.” They serve similar purposes as dissents by recording a justice’s thinking on an issue, and that thinking could be used in the future on similar cases.  
The math can get tricky with concurrences. In the case about water for the Navajo Reservation, four justices signed the majority opinion, while the fifth justice wrote a concurrence. So, four justices in the majority plus one writing a concurrence equals five justices agreeing on a holding.
Additionally, justices in the majority can sign onto the majority opinion as well as a concurring opinion.  
In Griswold v. Connecticut, a 1965 case regarding privacy rights, seven justices agreed that a right to privacy could be found in the Constitution, but they disagreed about where that right was based. Five justices signed the majority opinion. Three of those five justices also signed on to a separate concurring opinion. Two other justices did not sign the majority opinion; instead, they each wrote their own separate opinions, concurring with the majority’s conclusion but not joining the majority opinion. 
That’s a total of four opinions all agreeing that there is a constitutional right to privacy but disagreeing about where in the Constitution that right can be located.
What should a lower court do with an opinion like in the Griswold case? Lower courts still must follow the majority opinion, but they may choose to incorporate the reasoning from a concurring opinion.
Legal conversations
Concurring and dissenting opinions are a conversation with the majority opinion about the legal issues in the case. So the next time you hear about a concurrence or dissent, pay attention. 
At the very least, you can learn about how a particular justice views the issue at hand. What’s more, you may gain a window to where the law is headed in the future.

How Iran selects its supreme leader â a political scientist and Iran expert explains,https://theconversation.com/how-iran-selects-its-supreme-leader-a-political-scientist-and-iran-expert-explains-230613,3013159,"Iran, Shiite, Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iranian revolution, Religion and society","
The sudden death of President Ebrahim Raisi is unlikely to drastically alter Iran’s foreign and domestic policies, but it has left a power vacuum. 
As stipulated by the constitution, Raisi was replaced by his first vice president, Mohammad Mokhber, as interim president before presidential elections are held in 50 days. That said, Raisi was supposedly being groomed to succeed an aging Ali Khamenei as the supreme leader, the Islamic Republic’s ultimate power broker and decision-maker.  
The Iranian supreme leader serves for life and is the highest religious and political authority in the Islamic Republic. He is the commander in chief of the armed forces and oversees other key institutions such as the judicial branch and state media. He also supervises the Guardian Council, which has the power to vet electoral candidates and veto parliamentary legislation. In this capacity, the supreme leader has the final say on foreign policy and different areas of domestic policy. 
As a scholar of Iran’s domestic politics and foreign policy, I have studied the process of who succeeds or gets elected to the position. This process has evolved during the Islamic Republic’s nearly 50-year history and is more a function of politics than religion.





The history of succession
Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, there have been two supreme leaders – Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who ruled between 1979-1989, and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who succeeded him. 
In addition to being a revolutionary and charismatic leader, Khomeini was a grand ayatollah and source of emulation, or “marja’ al-taqlid.” A grand ayatollah is among a select few of the highest-ranking clerics, considered a “sign of God,” in Twelver Shiism, the largest branch of Shiism and the state religion of Iran. These clerics have the authority to make legal decisions for their lay followers and for lower-ranking clerics. 
While Khomeini came into power as a religious cleric and revolutionary leader in February 1979, it was not until the Islamic Constitution was approved through a referendum in December of that year that the position or office of supreme leader was officially established. It was inspired by Khomeini’s concept of the Guardianship of the Jurist, or the idea that a senior cleric should supervise the state in accordance with Islamic law. 
The electoral facade
In 1982-83, when Khomeini was the supreme leader and Khamenei was the third president, the position or office fell under the purview of the Assembly of Experts, as enshrined in articles 107 and 111 of the constitution.
The Assembly of Experts is a body that comprises over 80 members who serve eight-year terms and are authorized to elect, supervise and, if necessary, dismiss the supreme leader. Although the members are elected by a popular vote, they are first vetted by the Guardian Council, much like presidential and parliamentary candidates. 
It should be noted that the members of the Guardian Council are appointed by the supreme leader and the chief justice, or head of the judiciary, who is also appointed by the supreme leader. Therefore, through the council, the supreme leader approves the candidates, who are potentially elected to a body that oversees him, making the process far from free and fair. 
As with the last election for the Assembly of Experts in March 2024, which had a historically low voter turnout of about 40%, the Guardian Council has disqualified many candidates. 
This is particularly the case with moderates and reformists, who tend to oppose the supreme leader on various issues. For this reason, the assembly has not been known to seriously supervise or challenge the supreme leader, and its proceedings have remained strictly confidential or closed to the public. 
The 1989 succession
Originally, the supreme leader was supposed to be a grand ayatollah and source of emulation. However, as Khomeini approached the end of his life in 1989, the constitution was amended so that a lower-ranking cleric like Khamenei could assume the position. 

As a seminary student of Khomeini who was more interested in politics than religion, Khamenei ranked below an ayatollah. Within the Shiite clerical hierarchy, and like other Islamic scholars who studied under an ayatollah, he earned the title Hojjat al-Eslam, or “proof of Islam.” 
After being appointed to succeed Khomeini, Khamenei’s rank was elevated overnight to a grand ayatollah. The reason for the appointment was that Khamenei, much like Raisi, was a longtime loyalist and regime insider, even though he lacked the charismatic and religious authority of Khomeini. 
Until 1989, Grand Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri – a prominent theologian and revolutionary leader – was expected to take over as the supreme leader. That year, however, he was ultimately passed over by Khomeini and later placed under house arrest by Khamenei.
Montazeri succumbed to this fate because he had criticized the regime for its repression, especially the execution of thousands of political prisoners in 1988 by a committee of four prosecutors, one of whom was Raisi.
The situation with succession today
With only a single case serving as precedent, the succession process of the supreme leader seems to be far from formulaic and formalized. 
Technically, the Assembly of Experts is responsible for electing the future supreme leader. As with other institutions, however, it is the supreme leader who ultimately exercises authority over the assembly and not vice versa. 
Additionally, and because of the intervention of the Guardian Council, the Assembly of Experts and other institutions are currently controlled by hard-liners. 
This scenario also applies to a Parliament that could once again authorize amending the constitution and altering the required qualifications of the next leader. It is critical for Khamenei that the Assembly of Experts and Parliament – the Majles – are controlled by hard-liners who are regime loyalists. 
As with Raisi, and in the spirit of patronage or clientelism, hard-liners are often appointed to other positions inside the political and economic establishment by the supreme leader. Consequently, they owe their careers to him and tend to show their loyalty. 
While political outcomes in the Islamic Republic are difficult to predict, the process of succession largely lies in the hands of the supreme leader and is at his discretion. As in 1989, it will be dictated or determined by Khamenei’s political and personal preferences rather than religious and ideological principles. 
At the same time, it is safe to say that the hard-liners inside the Assembly of Experts and other institutions are not monolithic and do not all follow the agenda of the supreme leader. They presumably possess different opinions about who should succeed him, among other issues. 
From my perspective, while the supreme leader may hold the upper hand inside the system, the selection of his successor will likely involve some consultation and consensus with hard-liners. Doing so will be essential to navigating a transition made more delicate by the death of the hard-line president and potential heir.

A 25-year study reveals how empathy is passed from parents to teens to their future children,https://theconversation.com/a-25-year-study-reveals-how-empathy-is-passed-from-parents-to-teens-to-their-future-children-229780,3013158,"Psychology, Ethics, Parenting, Friendship, Empathy, Adolescence, Quick reads, New research, Research Brief","
Our new research shows that parents who express empathy toward their teenagers may give teens a head start in developing the skill themselves. In addition, adolescents who show empathy and support toward their friends are more likely to become supportive parents, which may foster empathy in their own offspring.
How we did our work
The KLIFF/VIDA study at the University of Virginia has tracked 184 adolescents for more than 25 years: from age 13 well into their 30s. 
Starting in 1998, teens came to the university every year with their parents and closest friend, and a team of researchers recorded videos of their conversations. Researchers observed how much empathy the mother showed to her 13-year-old when her teen needed help with a problem. We measured empathy by rating how present and engaged mothers were in the conversation, whether they had an accurate understanding of their teen’s problem, and how much help and emotional support they offered. 
Then, each year until teens were 19 years old, we observed whether teens showed those same types of empathic behaviors toward their close friends.






A decade later, when some of those same teens were starting to have children of their own, we surveyed them about their own parenting. We also asked them about their young children’s empathy. For example, parents rated how often their child “tries to understand how others feel” and “tries to comfort others.”
We found that the more empathic a mother was toward her teenager at age 13, the more empathic the teen was toward their close friends across the adolescent years. Among teens who later had kids themselves, the ones who had shown more empathy for close friends as adolescents became more supportive parents as adults. In turn, these parents’ supportive responses to their children’s distress were associated with reports of their young children’s empathy.
Why it matters
The ability to empathize with other people in adolescence is a critical skill for maintaining good relationships, resolving conflict, preventing violent crime and having good communication skills and more satisfying relationships as an adult.
Adults want teens to develop good social skills and moral character, but simply telling them to be kind doesn’t always work. Our findings suggest that if parents hope to raise empathic teens, it may be helpful to give them firsthand experiences of being understood and supported. 
But teens also need opportunities to practice and refine these skills with their peers. Adolescent friendships may be an essential “training ground” for teens to learn social skills such as empathy, how to respond effectively to other people’s suffering, and supportive caregiving abilities that they can put to use as parents. Our lab’s most recent paper presents some of the first evidence that having supportive teenage friendships matters for future parenting.
What’s next
We’re continuing to follow these participants to understand how their experiences with parents and peers during adolescence might play a role in how the next generation develops. We’re also curious to understand what factors might interrupt intergenerational cycles of low empathy, aggression and harsh parenting. For example, it’s possible that having supportive friends could compensate for a lack of empathy experienced from one’s family.
While it’s true that you can’t choose your family, you can choose your friends. Empowering teens to choose friendships characterized by mutual understanding and support could have long-term ripple effects for the next generation.
The Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.

Hereâs how machine learning can violate your privacy,https://theconversation.com/heres-how-machine-learning-can-violate-your-privacy-226299,3013157,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Privacy, Technology, Machine learning, Data privacy, Inference, DIfferential privacy","
Machine learning has pushed the boundaries in several fields, including personalized medicine, self-driving cars and customized advertisements. Research has shown, however, that these systems memorize aspects of the data they were trained with in order to learn patterns, which raises concerns for privacy.
In statistics and machine learning, the goal is to learn from past data to make new predictions or inferences about future data. In order to achieve this goal, the statistician or machine learning expert selects a model to capture the suspected patterns in the data. A model applies a simplifying structure to the data, which makes it possible to learn patterns and make predictions.  
Complex machine learning models have some inherent pros and cons. On the positive side, they can learn much more complex patterns and work with richer datasets for tasks such as image recognition and predicting how a specific person will respond to a treatment.
However, they also have the risk of overfitting to the data. This means that they make accurate predictions about the data they were trained with but start to learn additional aspects of the data that are not directly related to the task at hand. This leads to models that aren’t generalized, meaning they perform poorly on new data that is the same type but not exactly the same as the training data. 





While there are techniques to address the predictive error associated with overfitting, there are also privacy concerns from being able to learn so much from the data.
How machine learning algorithms make inferences
Each model has a certain number of parameters. A parameter is an element of a model that can be changed. Each parameter has a value, or setting, that the model derives from the training data. Parameters can be thought of as the different knobs that can be turned to affect the performance of the algorithm. While a straight-line pattern has only two knobs, the slope and intercept, machine learning models have a great many parameters. For example, the language model GPT-3, has 175 billion.
In order to choose the parameters, machine learning methods use training data with the goal of minimizing the predictive error on the training data. For example, if the goal is to predict whether a person would respond well to a certain medical treatment based on their medical history, the machine learning model would make predictions about the data where the model’s developers know whether someone responded well or poorly. The model is rewarded for predictions that are correct and penalized for incorrect predictions, which leads the algorithm to adjust its parameters – that is, turn some of the “knobs” – and try again.

To avoid overfitting the training data, machine learning models are checked against a validation dataset as well. The validation dataset is a separate dataset that is not used in the training process. By checking the machine learning model’s performance on this validation dataset, developers can ensure that the model is able to generalize its learning beyond the training data, avoiding overfitting. 
While this process succeeds at ensuring good performance of the machine learning model, it does not directly prevent the machine learning model from memorizing information in the training data. 
Privacy concerns
Because of the large number of parameters in machine learning models, there is a potential that the machine learning method memorizes some data it was trained on. In fact, this is a widespread phenomenon, and users can extract the memorized data from the machine learning model by using queries tailored to get the data. 
If the training data contains sensitive information, such as medical or genomic data, then the privacy of the people whose data was used to train the model could be compromised. Recent research showed that it is actually necessary for machine learning models to memorize aspects of the training data in order to get optimal performance solving certain problems. This indicates that there may be a fundamental trade-off between the performance of a machine learning method and privacy.
Machine learning models also make it possible to predict sensitive information using seemingly nonsensitive data. For example, Target was able to predict which customers were likely pregnant by analyzing purchasing habits of customers who registered with the Target baby registry. Once the model was trained on this dataset, it was able to send pregnancy-related advertisements to customers it suspected were pregnant because they purchased items such as supplements or unscented lotions. 
Is privacy protection even possible?
While there have been many proposed methods to reduce memorization in machine learning methods, most have been largely ineffective. Currently, the most promising solution to this problem is to ensure a mathematical limit on the privacy risk. 
The state-of-the-art method for formal privacy protection is differential privacy. Differential privacy requires that a machine learning model does not change much if one individual’s data is changed in the training dataset. Differential privacy methods achieve this guarantee by introducing additional randomness into the algorithm learning that “covers up” the contribution of any particular individual. Once a method is protected with differential privacy, no possible attack can violate that privacy guarantee.
Even if a machine learning model is trained using differential privacy, however, that does not prevent it from making sensitive inferences such as in the Target example. To prevent these privacy violations, all data transmitted to the organization needs to be protected. This approach is called local differential privacy, and Apple and Google have implemented it.

Because differential privacy limits how much the machine learning model can depend on one individual’s data, this prevents memorization. Unfortunately, it also limits the performance of the machine learning methods. Because of this trade-off, there are critiques on the usefulness of differential privacy, since it often results in a significant drop in performance.
Going forward
Due to the tension between inferential learning and privacy concerns, there is ultimately a societal question of which is more important in which contexts. When data does not contain sensitive information, it is easy to recommend using the most powerful machine learning methods available. 
When working with sensitive data, however, it is important to weigh the consequences of privacy leaks, and it may be necessary to sacrifice some machine learning performance in order to protect the privacy of the people whose data trained the model.

Phone cameras can take in more light than the human eye â thatâs why low-light events like the northern lights often look better through your phone camera,https://theconversation.com/phone-cameras-can-take-in-more-light-than-the-human-eye-thats-why-low-light-events-like-the-northern-lights-often-look-better-through-your-phone-camera-230068,3013156,"Artificial intelligence (AI), Art, Photography, Light, Vision, Cameras, Northern lights, Eyes, astrophotography","
Smartphone cameras have significantly improved in recent years. Computational photography and AI allow these devices to capture stunning images that can surpass what we see with the naked eye. Photos of the northern lights, or aurora borealis, provide one particularly striking example. 
If you saw the northern lights during the geomagnetic storms in May 2024, you might have noticed that your smartphone made the photos look even more vivid than reality.
Auroras, known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis) occur when the solar wind disturbs Earth’s magnetic field. They appear as streaks of color across the sky. 

What makes photos of these events even more striking than they appear to the eye? As a professor of computational photography, I’ve seen how the latest smartphone features overcome the limitations of human vision. 





Your eyes in the dark
Human eyes are remarkable. They allow you to see footprints in a sun-soaked desert and pilot vehicles at high speeds. However, your eyes perform less impressively in low light. 
Human eyes contain two types of cells that respond to light – rods and cones. Rods are numerous and much more sensitive to light. Cones handle color but need more light to function. As a result, at night our vision relies heavily on rods and misses color.

The result is like wearing dark sunglasses to watch a movie. At night, colors appear washed out and muted. Similarly, under a starry sky, the vibrant hues of the aurora are present but often too dim for your eyes to see clearly.
In low light, your brain prioritizes motion detection and shape recognition to help you navigate. This trade-off means the ethereal colors of the aurora are often invisible to the naked eye. Technology is the only way to increase their brightness.
Taking the perfect picture
Smartphones have revolutionized how people capture the world. These compact devices use multiple cameras and advanced sensors to gather more light than the human eye can, even in low-light conditions. They achieve this through longer exposure times – how long the camera takes in light – larger apertures and increasing the ISO, the amount of light your camera lets in.
But smartphones do more than adjust these settings. They also leverage computational photography to enhance your images using digital techniques and algorithms. Image stabilization reduces the camera’s shakiness, and exposure settings optimize the amount of light the camera captures. 
Multi-image processing creates the perfect photo by stacking multiple images together. A setting called night mode can balance colors in low light, while LiDAR capabilities in some phones keep your images in precise focus.

LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging, and phones with this setting emit laser pulses to calculate the distances to objects in the scene quickly in any kind of light. LiDAR generates a depth map of the environment to improve focus and make objects in your photos stand out.

Artificial intelligence tools in your smartphone camera can further enhance your photos by optimizing the settings, applying bursts of light and using super-resolution techniques to get really fine detail. They can even identify faces in your photos.
AI processing in your smartphone’s camera
While there’s plenty you can do with a smartphone camera, regular cameras do have larger sensors and superior optics, providing more control over the images you take. Camera manufacturers like Nikon, Sony and Canon typically avoid tampering with the image, instead letting the photographer take creative control.
These cameras offer photographers the flexibility of shooting in raw format, which allows you to keep more of each image’s data for editing and often produces higher-quality results.
Unlike dedicated cameras, modern smartphone cameras use AI while and after you snap a picture to enhance your photos’ quality. While you’re taking a photo, AI tools will analyze the scene you’re pointing the camera at and adjust settings such as exposure, white balance and ISO, while recognizing the subject you’re shooting and stabilizing the image. These make sure you get a great photo when you hit the button.
You can often find features that use AI such as high dynamic range, night mode and portrait mode, enabled by default or accessible within your camera settings.
AI algorithms further enhance your photos by refining details, reducing blur and applying effects such as color correction after you take the photo. 
All these features help your camera take photos in low-light conditions and contributed to the stunning aurora photos you may have captured with your phone camera.
While the human eye struggles to fully appreciate the northern lights’ otherworldly hues at night, modern smartphone cameras overcome this limitation. By leveraging AI and computational photography techniques, your devices allow you to see the bold colors of solar storms in the atmosphere, boosting color and capturing otherwise invisible details that even the keenest eye will miss.

"Most Israelis dislike Netanyahu, but support the war in Gaza â an Israeli scholar explains whatâs driving public opinion",https://theconversation.com/most-israelis-dislike-netanyahu-but-support-the-war-in-gaza-an-israeli-scholar-explains-whats-driving-public-opinion-230046,3013155,"Holocaust, Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli politics, Likud Party, Israel history, Israeli hostages, Israel-Hamas war, Israeli psyche, Jewish people, Jewish memory, Oct. 7 attack, Gaza conflict, Israel-Hamas, Israeli public opinion, October 7, 2023, Israel-Hamas conflict, Gaza war","
Eight months after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip, some critics observe that the Israeli military hasn’t met either of its goals of destroying Hamas and rescuing all of the remaining 133 hostages Hamas is holding.
Yet two-thirds of Israelis still support their military’s aggressive approach in Gaza – including limiting humanitarian aid to Palestinians. 
While many Israelis support the military’s war in Gaza, most Israelis have also lost confidence in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government and would like to see new political leadership.
As someone who has studied Israeli politics for almost three decades, I believe it’s important to understand what elements contribute to Israelis’ collective mindset to explain these seemingly contradictory dynamics and views.






A familiar feeling of persecution
Hamas militants killed an estimated 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and took 240 hostages back to Gaza. 
The brutal Oct. 7 murders and the extermination of entire communities in southern Israel left Israelis feeling shocked, vulnerable and insecure. The attacks reminded Israelis that the country faces existential threats, which they believe need to be eliminated in any way possible. 

Jewish people have long been persecuted, dating back from the biblical era to the Holocaust during World War II. Some scholars call this feeling of a constant, looming risk of persecution the “Masada syndrome.” Masada, an ancient fortification in southern Israel, was where the ancient Kingdom of Israel waged a final battle against the Roman army in A.D. 73. Masada was eventually destroyed and all its Jewish inhabitants committed suicide in order to avoid becoming enslaved by the Romans. Jews then lost their political independence for almost 2,000 years, until Israel was established in 1948.
The story of Masada is still taught and remembered in Israel as a constant reminder that Jewish people cannot ever fully rely on the mercy or help of other countries – and that Jewish identity and independence are always at risk of persecution. For a long time, the Israeli Defense Forces held induction ceremonies atop Masada, which is also a popular tourism site.
As a ceremonial text used during the Jewish holiday of Passover says, “Each and every generation they rise up against us to destroy us.”
The Masada syndrome has been less pronounced among most Israelis in recent decades. This is partially because, up until recently, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been relatively muted since the second intifada, a violent uprising by Palestinians in the early 2000s. Israel also signed peace treaties with Arab countries including the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco over the past several years.
The Oct. 7 attacks resulted in widespread national trauma and pushed many Israelis to re-adopt the Masada mentality. 
Alone again
The global response to Oct. 7 is another important factor that pushed many Israelis to retreat to old feelings of persecution and a perceived need for self-defense. 
While the United States, the United Kingdom and France expressed strong support for Israel shortly after Oct. 7, other countries, like Russia and China, did not condemn the Hamas attacks. 
It also took United Nations experts about five months to recognize the systematic sexual violence committed on Oct. 7.
Further isolating Israelis was their widespread rejection that Israel is committing war crimes, as the International Criminal Court recently alleged in a request for arrest warrants for Netanyahu and Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant. Some Israelis have also questioned the accuracy of information about civilian death tolls in Gaza.
Most Israelis see these allegations of genocide as an example of global bias against Israel and as a new form of antisemitism. 
Netanyahu has exploited these feelings of persecution to both legitimize Israel’s war in Gaza and to downplay any criticism of his own leadership.

Netanyahu’s downfall
Since the beginning of the war in Gaza, polls consistently reflect Israelis’ declining support for the conservative political parties that make up Netanyahu’s ruling coalition. 
A May 2024 poll shows that if elections were held today, Netanyahu’s party would lose almost 40% of the seats it has in the Israeli Parliament. The same poll also found that just 35% of Israelis think that Netanyahu is fit to be a prime minister.
In January, just 15% of Israelis thought Netanyahu should stay in office.
Several factors help explain Israelis’ overall support for Netanyahu’s policies in Gaza, but their growing distrust of him as a politician and leader. 
First, most Israelis blame Netanyahu’s government for Oct. 7. They see Netanyahu as primarily responsible for the fact that Israel did not address Hamas’ strengthening military capabilities in the past decade, including its creation of underground tunnels in Gaza. 
There are also damaging issues that predate Oct 7. Netanyahu has tried to undermine the independence of the country’s judicial branch and passed legislation in 2023 that limited courts’ judicial review powers over legislation and government policies. This sparked widespread protests in Israel.
Israelis are also concerned that Netanyahu’s approach to the war – and inability to reach a hostage deal or agree to some kind of cease-fire – may be affected by his desire to stay in power. Netanyahu is facing several corruption-related charges and wants to delay these criminal trials – his defense team has said that the war leaves him with little time to attend the trials. Netanyahu also wants to appease his radical right-wing supporters, who want the war to continue. 
Israelis’ concerns about Netanyahu over the past few months manifested in an outbreak of mass demonstrations in different Israeli cities. These protesters, including families of the hostages, are demanding that Netanyahu reach a deal that will free the remaining hostages – even if that means agreeing to a long-term cease-fire. 
But it is not clear if these protesters make up the majority of the public opinion – and it is important to not confuse this protest with most Israelis’ desire to see Hamas defeated.     
Israel’s dilemma
Israel’s path forward is unclear, and it will be influenced by a few issues. An increase in public pressure on Netanyahu may force him eventually to take responsibility for not preventing the Oct. 7 attack and resign. 
The growing intensity of Israelis’ demonstrations demanding his resignation show the increasing possibility of such a scenario. 
At the same time, growing international pressure on Israel to end its war in Gaza may lead Netanyahu to have more conflicts with far-right members of his coalition, eventually causing the disintegration of his administration and his fall from power. 
Finally, the possibility of the war expanding into a broader regional conflict would dramatically change the region’s current dynamics in ways that are difficult to predict. Nonetheless, this development could force Israel to end the war in Gaza in order to address other emerging military threats.

Military experts believe that the US policy prohibiting Ukraine from using American weaponry to attack targets inside Russia is giving the invader an important advantage as it develops its recent offensive in the northern Kharkiv region. 
The latest offensive began on May 10, but Kharkiv itself – Ukraine’s second-largest city – has come under daily missile attack since the full-scale war began in February 2022. 
The city of about 1.4 million people, now crowded with refugees from the surrounding towns and villages, has become something of a symbol of continuing Ukrainian resistance.
Being able to use the powerful, long-range weapons supplied by its western allies would allow Ukraine to strike at targets across the border in Russia. This would help Kyiv’s military planners shape the wider battlefield in their favour. As it stands, Russia can mass forces and supplies in relative safety as its key infrastructure, such as air bases and supply depots, lie just across the border. 





Washington has always been adamant that Ukraine mustn’t use its weapons to target Russia. But there are reports that the State Department is pushing for a change in light of the fresh offensive in the Kharkiv region.
On a visit to Kyiv on May 15, US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, implied that the time might be right to allow Ukraine to use US weapon systems to strike at targets across the border, saying: “We have not encouraged or enabled strikes outside of Ukraine, but ultimately Ukraine has to make decisions for itself about how it’s going to conduct this war.”
There has been no official policy shift, but the removal of this limitation on Kyiv’s use of US weapons systems would mark a significant moment in the conflict. Despite all the setbacks of the past year, Kyiv has largely adhered to this rule, mindful that serious violations could curb foreign support.
Several of Ukraine’s allies have given the green light for Kyiv to use their weapon systems within Russian territory. The UK foreign secretary, David Cameron, recently said during a visit to Kyiv that Ukraine “absolutely has the right to strike back at Russia.” It appears that France is poised to follow suit.
Ukraine has already conducted strikes deep within Russia using its own weapons, including basic drones, which have significantly hampered Russian fuel production and even targeted Moscow. But it has limited resources. Using western-made systems would allow Ukraine to increase the tempo of these attacks, potentially limiting Russia’s ability to commit to offensives.

Strikes by Ukraine have already begun to disrupt the Russian rear. If US weapons systems were approved for use against targets in Russia, then the Russian interior would no longer be safe. Importantly, it could force Moscow to pull Russian air defence and strike aircraft away from the frontlines to defend critical infrastructure. 
Still, a potential expansion of how this aid can be used, including striking targets within Russia, raises several important considerations.
Ultimately, allowing Ukraine to use western weapons against targets in Russia is not guaranteed to shift the overall strategic balance greatly. It will disrupt Russian supply lines, command structures and logistical hubs, thereby reducing the effectiveness of Russian military operations in Ukraine. But it will not fundamentally alter the balance of power. 
Weapons such as the high mobility artillery rocket systems (Himars) are effective enough, but they are unlikely to alter the essential arithmetic at play in what has become a brutal war of attrition. Successive mobilisations have seen Russian forces increased by 15% since the war’s outset. These raw numbers are difficult for Ukraine to match.

Ukraine is struggling with recruitment and its economy is flagging. Unless Kyiv and its allies can fundamentally shift the character of this conflict, the outlook is not good. At present, Putin is content to grind down Ukrainian resistance and wait for western backing to diminish.
In this regard, the upcoming US election will be a key moment. Another Trump presidency could see Washington refocus on domestic issues, perhaps even cutting the supply of military aid.  
Potential for escalation
But the use of western weapons to strike Russian territory would have significant geopolitical implications. It could lead to increased tensions between Russia and the Nato countries supplying the weapons. The risk of escalation, including the possibility of Russia retaliating against Nato members, is a serious concern, particularly given Vladimir Putin’s repeated use of nuclear threats aimed to stoke western fears. 
The potential for miscalculation and unintended consequences cannot be overlooked. Striking Russian territory could provoke a strong and possibly unpredictable response from Russia. The Kremlin’s nuclear threats, while often considered bluster, cannot be entirely dismissed, especially if they choose perceive direct attacks on their homeland as an existential threat. Russian military doctrine allows the use of nuclear weapons if this is the case.
The debate over whether to permit Ukrainian use of western military aid to strike Russian territory involves a complex interplay of military strategy and geopolitical considerations. While such a move could provide significant tactical advantages to Ukraine, it will not fundamentally alter the overall strategic picture. It also carries substantial risks that must be carefully weighed. 
The evolving nature of this conflict requires continuous assessment and a cautious approach to ensure that the actions taken contribute to a sustainable and just resolution without escalating into a broader, more devastating war.

Scarlett Johanssonâs complaint to OpenAI is a new benchmark in the development of machine intelligence,https://theconversation.com/scarlett-johanssons-complaint-to-openai-is-a-new-benchmark-in-the-development-of-machine-intelligence-230655,3013101,"Microsoft, Artificial intelligence (AI), Apple, Technology, Acting, Aristotle, OpenAI, Scarlett Johansson, virtual assistants, Deepfakes, Large language models, Give me perspective, Sam Altman, GPT-4o","
Over 2,000 years ago, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle came up with a way to build arguments. He called this “rhetoric” and described how logic in the text of an argument or speech, the needs and understanding of the audience, and the authority of the speaker could be used as strategies to persuade others.
Rather than just relying on logic in the argument or trust in the speaker, politicians and actors have long recognised that there is nothing as effective as using emotion to win the hearts and, consequently, minds of an audience.
With the launch of GPT-4o last week, we may have just seen a machine ideally suited to this task. While most see this as a fantastic breakthrough, having the potential to benefit very many people, some view it with more caution.
Despite having previously declined OpenAI’s request to sample her voice, actress Scarlett Johansson said she was “shocked” and “angered” when she heard the new GPT-4o speak.





One of the five voices used by GPT-4o, called Sky, sounded uncannily like the actress in her role as the AI Samantha in the 2013 film Her – about a man who falls in love with a virtual assistant. Adding to the discussion, OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman appeared to play up the comparison between Sky and Samantha/Johansson, tweeting “her” on the launch day of GPT-4o.
OpenAI later posted on X that it was “working on pausing the use of Sky” and created a web page on May 19, explaining that a different actress had been used. The company also expanded on how the voices were chosen.

The fact that the film Her was almost immediately referenced when GPT-4o was launched has helped raise awareness of the technology among the general public and, perhaps, made its capabilities seem less scary.
This is fortunate because rumours about partnering with Apple have ignited privacy fears, with iOS18 coming out next month. Similarly, OpenAI has partnered with Microsoft with its new generation of AI powered Windows system called Copilot + PC.
Unlike other large language models (LLMs), GPT-4o (or omni) has been built from the ground up to understand not only text but also vision and sound in a unified way. This is true multi-modality going far beyond the capabilities of “traditional” LLMs.
It can recognise nuances in speech such as emotion, breathing, ambient noise, birdsong and it can integrate this with what it sees.
It’s a unified multi-modal model (meaning it can handle photos and text), is quick – responding at the same speed as normal human speech (at an average of 320 milliseconds) – and can be interrupted. The result is unnervingly natural, altering tone and emotional intensity appropriately. It can even sing. Some have even complained about how “flirty” GPT-4o is. No wonder some actors are worried.
It genuinely is a new way to interact with AI. It represents a subtle shift in our relationship with technology, providing a fundamentally new type of “natural” interface sometimes referred to as EAI, or empathetic AI.
The speed of this advance has unnerved many government organisations and police forces. It’s still unclear how best to deal with this technology if it is weaponised by rogue states or criminals. With audio deepfakes on the rise, it is becoming increasingly difficult to detect what is, and is not, real. Even friends of Johansson thought it was her.
In a year when elections are due to be held involving more than 4 billion potential voters, and when fraud based around targeted deepfake audio is on the rise, the dangers of weaponised AI should not be underestimated.
As Aristotle discovered, persuasive capability often isn’t about what you say, but in the way you say it. We all suffer from unconscious bias, an interesting report from the UK about accent bias highlights this. Some accents are more believable, authoritative, or even trustworthy than others. For this precise reason, people working in call centres are now using AI to “westernise” their voices. In GPT-4o’s case how it says things may be just as important as what it says.
If the AI understands the audience’s needs and is capable of logical reasoning, then perhaps the final piece that’s needed is the manner in which the message is delivered – as Aristotle identified 2,000 years ago. Perhaps then we will have created an AI that has the potential to become a superhuman master of rhetoric and with persuasive powers beyond the ability of audiences to resist.

"Affairs, diseases and menage a trois â real Regency sex was even raunchier than Bridgerton suggests",https://theconversation.com/affairs-diseases-and-menage-a-trois-real-regency-sex-was-even-raunchier-than-bridgerton-suggests-230446,3013100,"Sex, History, Netflix, English history, Period drama, history of sexuality, Bridgerton, Regency era, Give me perspective","
Many fans of the Netflix Regency series, Bridgerton, tune in for the steamy sex scenes, as much as the period drama. But how authentic are the show’s love scenes compared to the experience of sex in real Regency Britain? 
One reality not mentioned in the show is how common sexually transmitted disease was. An estimated fifth of Londoners suffered from syphilis in the late 18th century. And a greater proportion would have suffered from other afflictions, such as gonorrhoea or chlamydia. 
William Buchan, a doctor who wrote a popular medical tract on the Prevention and Cure of the Venereal Disease, attributed the spread of “the gentleman’s disease” to lewd women prowling the streets of London with no restraint, and to a lack of moral education from parents. 
Buchan advocated cleanliness and frequent washing or douches with solutions of quicklime, alkali or extracts of lead. The treatment for syphilis, once contracted, was equally perilous with pills or ointments made of mercury.

      Bridgerton: in a show full of sex, many of the characters know little about it – the real ladies of the ton weren't so ignorant




Knowledge of contraception was also patchy. James Boswell, the Scottish biographer and diarist who suffered 19 bouts of gonorrhoea, would frequent prostitutes clad in “armour” (a condom made of sheep’s gut). However, this was less to prevent pregnancy and more as protection against sexually transmitted diseases. 
It was not until 1823 that there were attempts to widely educate the population in matters of birth control when the radical, Francis Place, published his pamphlet, To the Married of Both Sexes. Place, influenced by the economist Thomas Malthus, was convinced of the need to control the population and saw preventing conception as the best means of achieving this.

Double standards and dangerous liaisons
Double standards were hardwired into society. Debauched women were seen as the carriers of sexually transmitted diseases, infecting the male population. But there was no sense that men bore any responsibility. Unmarried aristocratic women were expected to be chaste and were chaperoned at all times when in public. For aristocratic men, there were no such strictures – sexual conquests were signs of virility and masculinity. 
However, this was not the full picture, and behind the closed doors of country houses and London mansions, the reality could be quite different. 

Take for example, the close female relatives of the novelist (and lover to Lord Byron), Lady Caroline Lamb. Her aunt, Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, was in an unhappy marriage and lived in a menage a trois with her husband’s mistress, Lady Elizabeth (Bess) Foster. 
The Duke and Bess had two illegitimate children, Caroline St Jules and Augustus Clifford. Georgiana also had affairs and in 1791 became pregnant by her lover Charles Grey (who later became prime minister). She was dispatched to France for two years and forced to give up the child to Grey’s family. 
Caroline Lamb’s mother, Henrietta Ponsonby, Countess of Bessborough, also had numerous lovers including the playwright, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, and Lord Granville Leveson-Gower.

Ponsonby had two children with Leveson-Gower and manged to conceal her pregnancies from her husband. Her relationship with Leveson-Gower ended when she encouraged him to marry her niece, Georgiana’s daughter, Lady Harriet Cavendish, to advance his political career. Aristocratic women tended to have more freedom to partake in extramarital relationships once they had produced the requisite heir.
There are numerous examples of both aristocratic men and women having affairs, illicit relationships, dalliances and liaisons in Regency England. They graced the pages of the popular Tệte-à-Tệte series in the Town and Country magazine, which would thinly disguise their identities. 
However, while men could generally escape condemnation (although particularly juicy gossip might result in bawdy ballads or caricatures), women who transgressed could face social ostracism and effective exile from polite society. 
There were some who got revenge, nonetheless. Harriette Wilson, an accomplished courtesan had connections with those at the very top of society, including the prime minister, Lord Wellington. In 1825 sensing she might be at the end of her “career”, she published her memoirs, which quickly became a bestseller, and charged previous lovers £200 to keep their names out of print. 
Unlike other concubines and mistresses, discarded when their charms faded, Wilson ensured she received some recompense and her death certificate described her as a “woman of independent means”.

"We dropped over 8,000 pieces of litter into a fake river to fight plastic pollution",https://theconversation.com/we-dropped-over-8-000-pieces-of-litter-into-a-fake-river-to-fight-plastic-pollution-229779,3013099,"Oceans, Plastic, Rivers, Nature, Environment, Litter, Microplastics, Marine litter, Plastic pollution, riverine plastic pollution, Microplastic pollution","
Nobody really knows how much plastic is in the world’s rivers or where it accumulates.
Estimates of the amount of plastic entering the oceans from rivers range from 0.057 million to 2.75 million tonnes a year, or 10 to 250 bin lorry loads per day.
Plastic pollution can cause devastating effects to river ecosystems and the invertebrates, fish and mammals that live there. So improving these plastic estimates is vital.
This is why we’ve conducted research analysing how different pieces of litter behave in our waterways. We and our colleagues tracked the movement of more than 8,000 plastic items in large laboratory rivers, which can recreate the behaviour of real rivers under perfectly controlled conditions. 





Consider the journey of a plastic coffee cup that has been carried by the wind or rain into a nearby river. Does the cup settle on the riverbed? Does it break up and fragment into tiny microplastic particles? Or does the cup bounce along the riverbed transported by the flow? Maybe the cup is suspended in the water column or floats on the surface where it can be transported large distances – even all the way to the ocean.  

The number of different pathways a piece of plastic can take in waterways is diverse and complicated. Understanding the behaviour of plastic pollution in rivers may help to overcome this complexity. It could provide more accurate estimations of plastic pollution in our streams, rivers and freshwater systems.
If we know where the majority of river plastic pollution exists, we can design targeted methods to accurately count them and clean them up.
Bouncing and hopping
Our laboratory river is a long indoor glass tank with a controlled flow of water, which mirrors real river conditions. A variety of objects, from plastics to sediments, can be dropped into these fake rivers to study and measure how they move in real rivers. 
The first experiment we conducted involved tracking the movement of tiny spherical microplastic particles bouncing and hopping along an artificial riverbed. 
We recorded more than 11,000 different microplastic bounces, down to millimetre accuracy. Tracking these movements allowed us to characterise the behaviour of the microplastics under various conditions. We found that spherical microplastic particles behave in similar ways to natural sediment like sand and gravels. 

This is good news because a large body of research has already been developed over the last century for describing how small sediment particles travel in rivers. This knowledge can be transferred to better predict the movement of microplastics in rivers.
Our second and third experiments focused on tracking the movement of common sinking and floating litter items, such as cups, films and face masks. We found that plastic items move in diverse ways in rivers, depending on their shape, size and density.

      I sailed across oceans in search of microplastics – a new film charts my journey




We discovered that both sinking and floating litter can be caught at the water surface like flies in a spider’s web. Once plastics are caught by this surface tension, they cannot easily escape. This causes a build-up of plastic travelling on the river’s surface.
Those plastics which travel on the surface are easy to observe and count in rivers. But when the river flow increases, plastics may dive beneath the water’s surface, which makes them more difficult to count and monitor.

The data we collected was used to adapt the equations which were previously developed for sediments, to predict the total amount of plastic that travels in rivers. The equations could improve the monitoring of plastic pollution. The data also provides us with a better description of how plastic is transported in rivers. 
Solving the plastic crisis is just beginning. But our experiments take us one step closer to having a more realistic picture of plastic pollution in rivers, as well as where to focus any cleanup efforts.

The bacteria in your mouth play an important role in your health â here are four diseases linked to your oral microbiome,https://theconversation.com/the-bacteria-in-your-mouth-play-an-important-role-in-your-health-here-are-four-diseases-linked-to-your-oral-microbiome-230041,3013098,"Heart disease, Bacteria, Inflammation, Colon cancer, Respiratory disease, Alzheimer's disease, mouth microbiome, Educate me","
Your mouth is one of the most diverse habitats in the human body. It contains over 700 known species of bacteria, as well as yeasts, viruses and some protozoa. This community is collectively referred to as the oral microbiome – and like your gut microbiome, the bacteria in your mouth play an important role in your health.
Some of the most common diseases caused by changes to your oral microbiome are tooth decay and gum disease. But growing evidence suggests that the oral microbiome is also linked to many other serious health conditions that occur elsewhere in the body.
Respiratory diseases
Since the respiratory tract starts in the mouth and ends in the lungs, it’s perhaps not surprising that an overgrowth of the oral microbiome can result in these microbes being inhaled into the lungs.
This can commonly lead to infections such as pneumonia, an often fatal disease in the elderly that has been linked to poor oral hygiene, leading to an overgrowth of oral bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. 





Research has even demonstrated that introducing regular oral hygiene practices and professional dental cleaning in elderly care homes can reduce the number of pneumonia cases by a third. Keeping dentures and mouthguards clean is also important.
Poor oral health has also been linked to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and poorer respiratory function, and this is linked to changes in the oral microbiome.
Heart disease
One of the most common oral microbiome diseases is chronic gum disease. This is a destructive inflammatory response that destroys the bone and tissues that support the teeth, eventually resulting in tooth loss. This disease is caused by an overgrowth of the bacteria that thrive in the crevice between your gums and your teeth due to poor oral hygiene.
But what has puzzled researchers for years is the strong associations between gum disease and cardiovascular disease.
The link may be due to common risk factors. For example gum disease and heart disease are both more common in smokers.
Others have theorised that gum disease bacteria might travel to the heart and cause infection. No convincing evidence for this link has yet been presented.
Gum disease also triggers a strong inflammatory immune response. Inflammation is how the body tackles infections. It results in the production of immune cells and chemical signals that fight infection. But too much inflammation can be damaging. Some researchers think that inflammation caused by gum disease could damage the cardiovascular system.

One study showed that treating gum disease reduced inflammation levels in the bloodstream and significantly improved artery function. Other studies have also shown that treating gum disease reduces overall inflammation levels in the body. 
These studies demonstrate how a disease in the mouth can have significant effects on the function of tissues elsewhere in the body. And considering many people live with untreated gum disease for decades, the potential for long-term health impacts are significant.
Colon Cancer
Oral bacteria have been known to travel through the stomach and into the intestines. Generally, our oral microbes are not well adapted to this new environment and they normally die out. But in 2014, two studies showed that bowel cancers were heavily colonised by a species of bacteria called Fusobacterium which is normally found in dental plaque.
Both studies also showed Fusobacterium has a high affinity for malignant cancer cells. This is because the surface of cancer cells allows the bacterium to tightly bind and invade the tumour. Multiple studies have now confirmed that Fusobacterium can colonise tumours throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
Research has also shown that colon cancer patients heavily colonised with Fusobacterium respond worse to chemotherapy and have shorter life expectancy compared to those who are not colonised. This may be because tumours infected with Fusobacterium are more aggressive and therefore more likely to spread compared to those that aren’t infected with the bacteria. 
Investigations are ongoing into this relationship – and whether those at risk of bowel cancer could be vaccinated against this oral bug.
Alzheimer’s disease
One of the most controversial links between oral health and disease involves Alzheimer’s disease. 
Chronic gum disease has been associated with greater cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. But since both gum disease and Alzheimer’s disease are associated with ageing, it’s difficult to determine if there’s a clear cause-and-effect relationship.
But in 2019, researchers presented evidence that the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease were colonised with P gingivalis – one of the main bacteria that causes gum disease. The idea that the brain, a normally sterile part of the body, could be infected by oral bacteria is still highly controversial and requires further work. 
As with heart disease, the inflammation caused by gum disease has also been proposed to be a driver of Alzheimer’s disease in patients with poor oral health.
Good oral health
Although the impact of poor oral health seems overwhelming, the good news is that we have the power to manage our oral microbiome and prevent diseases related to it.
A good oral hygiene regimen is essential. This includes brushing twice a day and flossing regularly to control plaque and reduce the incidence of cavities and gum disease. If you smoke, quitting can greatly reduce your chances of developing gum disease. It’s also worthwhile visiting your dentist or hygienist every six months for a professional cleaning and personal oral hygiene advice.
All this work not only enhances your smile, but may even add years to your life.

Grattan on Friday: Growing momentum for governments to fight social mediaâs grip on children,https://theconversation.com/grattan-on-friday-growing-momentum-for-governments-to-fight-social-medias-grip-on-children-230771,3012955,"Social media, Domestic violence, mobile phone ban, eSafety, social issues, Chris Minns, Online Safety Act, Peter Malinauskas, Teens and social media","
While federal politics often seems “top down”, some issues are pushed onto the national agenda from lower levels. We’re seeing this with the increasing concern to protect kids from the harmful effects of social media. 
This week Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sympathised with calls for limits on children’s access to social media, while last week’s budget allocated funds for a trial of age verification, originally recommended by the eSafety Commissioner. The government in November also brought forward by a year the scheduled review of the Online Safety Act.
But on the whole, the federal government has been lagging behind the states and activist parents on an issue that has immense ramifications for a young generation that has been recording increased levels of stress and mental health problems. 
South Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas has recently  said his government will legislate, if feasible, to prohibit children under 14 accessing social media accounts. For those aged 14-15, parental consent would be needed.
This week Malinauskas had talks in Washington with the United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy about the issue. The premier later told the Adelaide Advertiser Murthy had endorsed the SA plan. 
“[Murthy] was essentially saying, governments don’t have time to waste because this is now creating almost a mental health emergency among young people.” Murthy also told him  young people  were more open to the idea of relinquishing social media than often thought, if their friends were off it, too. 

In New South Wales, Premier Chris Minns this week announced a summit, to be held in October, “to address the increasing harm online platforms are having on children and young people”. 
In Minns’ electorate of Kogarah, in Sydney’s south, there’s been intense activity on the issue. A group of parents with children at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Primary School and St Ursula’s College got together a few years ago to discuss delaying their kids getting onto smartphones and social media. 
Parent Dany Elachi, whose daughter was ten at the time, told me they thought concerted action gave them the best chance of “staying the course”  against the pressure from their children’s complaints, or pleas, that “everyone else” had a smartphone. 
The group of parents had no connection with Minns, then opposition leader, until reading an article by him in their local paper. His concerns chimed with their own and they reached out to him. 
The Heads Up Alliance is now a national movement  of thousands of Australian parents delaying smartphones  and social media for their children. 
The group lobbied Catholic authorities, and there is now a widespread ban on mobile phones in Sydney Catholic schools. 
Minns, as premier last year, implemented a ban on mobile phones in NSW public schools. All states and territories have acted on phone bans, with Queensland and the ACT falling into line earlier this year.  
These have been important steps, but perhaps the easy ones.  More robust action involves greater challenges to big tech and their revenue and customer streams. Capturing the kids is central to their business models. 
The Albanese government has already had a taste of what taking on big tech can look like in its fight with Elon Musk over the eSafety Commissioner’s demand that X (formerly Twitter) remove a post showing the stabbing of a bishop at a Sydney Assyrian church. 
Tougher action in dealing with social media is one area where  potential bipartisanship should be possible. Federal opposition communications spokesman David Coleman has been a strong proponent of protecting children and age verification. 
The NSW summit will  be attended by senior officials, academics, representatives from other jurisdictions, and people from  leading social media platforms. 

The idea of age-limited access to social media – the next logical step – is guaranteed to be a hot topic. 
While states have been leading the way, to have a prospect of working properly, any legislated ban on young people accessing social media sites needs to be national. There are likely also constitutional constraints  to be overcome. Minns has expressed doubt a ban would be enforceable at the state level.
Some  social media companies argue they don’t accept children under 13 setting up accounts.  But this has been unenforceable, even assuming the companies wanted to enforce it.
Albanese said: “We want to make sure that any changes that are made actually work. You don’t want them being circumvented around the side door, if you like.” 
That’s right – up to a point. It should not be an excuse for avoiding action. In reality, no ban is likely to be absolutely watertight. 
Critics of a ban cite privacy, concerned about the sort of information that would be handed to tech companies to establish a user’s age. But age has to be proven in many circumstances, and various methods could be used to minimise the privacy problem. 
Also, some critics say social media is important especially for young people who need connection; they say there would be harm in denying this to them. Here it’s a question of weighing one side against the other: the negatives of social media against the positives for young people. 
In his recent widely-publicised book,  The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues Gen Z (born after 1995)  have been  “rewired”. He dubs them the “the anxious generation”. 
With a combination of over-protective parents and the ubiquity of modern tech, Haidt says we’ve seen a move from a “play-based childhood” to a “phone-based childhood”. 
“Gen Z became the first  generation in history to go through puberty  with a portal in their pockets  that called them away from the people nearby  and into an alternative universe  that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and  […] unsuitable for children and adolescents,” Haidt writes. 
This had serious consequences for their mental health, he argues, with girls adversely affected in particular by social media, and boys more by pornography and addiction to video gaming. 
While Haidt primarily writes of the American scene, he includes findings from other western countries, which he says show similar trends. 
Haidt prescribes four lines of action. Parents should not give their children smartphones before high school. Children should not be on social media before 16. Schools should be phone-free.  Children should have more unsupervised play and childhood independence. 
Those who fear that social media, for all its pluses, can be a serious threat to young people, will believe a lot more needs to be done than we’re doing now. The burden is not one that can be carried by government, schools, or other authorities alone. Parents must also do their part. But parents need help from the institutions to do it. 
Back at ground zero in the battle to curb harm from social media, Dany and his wife have “stayed the course”. Their daughter, now almost 15, doesn’t have a smartphone or a social media account. “We bought her a basic phone,” Dany says. “But it’s so unappealing she rarely uses it.”

Why Vladimir Putin seems stronger now than he was a year ago,https://theconversation.com/why-vladimir-putin-seems-stronger-now-than-he-was-a-year-ago-230362,3012710,"Russia, Vladimir Putin, Kremlin, Kharkiv, Give me perspective","
Vladmir Putin appears far stronger now than he did at any other time since Russia launched a full-scale invasion into Ukrainian territory in February 2022. 
On the ground Russian troops are pushing hard into Ukrainian territory and have captured several villages in the past two weeks alone. Plenty of other indicators, too, show Russia’s growing strength and suggest a future in which a Ukrainian, and western, defeat is becoming a more realistic possibility. 
On the domestic front, over the past year, Putin has faced down a mutiny by his erstwhile ally Yevgeny Prigozhin, who was subsequently killed in a plane crash. His only other major opponent, Alexei Navalny, perished in a penal colony in Russia’s far north earlier this year. 
After being re-elected to yet another term as Russian president, Putin has also consolidated his alliances with Iran and North Korea, which supply Moscow with much-needed military equipment. This may not be the company of choice for a self-declared great power, but it keeps the Russian war machine well-oiled – in sharp contrast to the problems that Ukraine has faced over the past six months with western military aid. 





At the same time, President Xi Jinping of China has reassured Putin of his continuing support during a high-profile state visit on May 16-17 2024. The seemingly strong bond between Moscow and Beijing, and between Xi and Putin personally, also appears to be more sustainable than the relationships that Kyiv has with western capitals. Within the EU, Slovakia and Hungary have repeatedly set out their opposition to continued western support for Ukraine. 
Russia’s offensive in the Kharkiv region, which began on May 10 2024, has enabled Moscow to capture several villages and drive some 10 kilometres deep into Ukraine. More than 10,000 people have been displaced amid constant Russian bombing and infantry assaults, adding pressure on already stretched humanitarian aid operations in the area and the city of Kharkiv in particular, which already hosts 200,000 displaced people. 
Russian successes around Kharkiv come in the wake of territorial gains elsewhere along the 1,000km-long frontline over the past several months. While not a game changer in the Kremlin’s war of aggression against Ukraine, Moscow appears to have significant momentum behind its ground operations as Kyiv struggles to hold off Russian troops. 
Russian advances this year have all but wiped out the Ukrainian gains from last year’s counter offensive. While Russia has only captured one major town — Avdiivka — since it took Bakhmut a year ago, it has captured some 500 square kilometres of Ukrainian territory over recent months. 
As the Kremlin keeps up the pressure, Ukraine continues to suffer from shortages of weapons and ammunition even as more US supplies are finally beginning to reach the frontlines. 

Future western support for Ukraine is far less certain than it seemed a year ago. Consequently, future-proofing aid for Ukraine is high on the agenda for Kyiv’s allies, especially with an eye to upcoming presidential and congressional elections in the US, where Trump and his supporters have suggested cutting off aid to Ukraine. President Joe Biden remains staunchly committed to Kyiv for now, but it is far from certain that he will win a second term in November this year. 
Western wavering
The EU has managed to agree on a deal on how to use the profits from frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine. By contrast, G7 countries struggle to agree on how to finance ongoing support for Ukraine, especially over the use of frozen Russian assets in the west.
What appears as Russia’s strength is, in part at least, Ukraine’s and the west’s weakness. While Russia has mercilessly struck targets across Ukraine for more than two years now, Kyiv has been constrained by the types of weapons and munitions supplied by the west and by the rules of engagement attached to these deliveries, such as where they can be used. This may slowly be changing with more arms deliveries now reaching Ukraine with fewer strings attached to how Kyiv can use them.
The Kremlin has had no qualms in using convicts at the front and mobilising large numbers of young Russians for its war effort. Or in sacrificing their lives in holding off Ukraine’s counter-offensive last year and achieving its own territorial gains this year. 
By contrast, Ukraine only updated its mobilisation laws in April, lowering the age of conscription from 27 to 25 years. This has yet to translate into tangible gains on the battlefield in the form of fresh, well-trained and equipped troops.
Putin makes his own decisions, almost completely unconstrained within his political regime. Buoyed by the resources that Russia can muster domestically and source from his allies, he has been able to recover from strategic and tactical mistakes. 
What passes for strategy in the west is often no more than the best deal that can be agreed among 32 Nato and 27 EU members who all push and pull in different directions. The resulting permanent crisis management has, so far, prevented a defeat of Ukraine. But it has not, and will not, pave a way to victory. 
Putin’s strength is relative, rather than absolute. And therein lie both a danger and an opportunity for Ukraine and the west. 
More muddling through by the west will make Putin look stronger than he is and could further increase the pro-Russian narrative of an unwinnable war for Ukraine and the west. But if Kyiv’s western allies finally muster the will to provide the resources Kyiv needs, the balance of power could decisively shift to Ukraine’s advantage.

Moments of hope: how Indians keep pushing back against the hollowing out of democracy,https://theconversation.com/moments-of-hope-how-indians-keep-pushing-back-against-the-hollowing-out-of-democracy-230609,3012709,"Audio, Hope, Narendra Modi, Podcasts, India elections, India's Citizenship Amendment Act, The Conversation Weekly, India farmers, Give me perspective, India election 2024","
After six weeks of voting in the world’s largest democracy, on June 4, Indians will learn who is to be their next prime minister. Narendra Modi, standing for a third term, is the frontrunner. 
Critics of Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) warn that India’s democracy has been hollowed out during his premiership, including through its treatment of religious minorities, most notably Muslims, the targeting of political adversaries, and by pushing through laws with little debate in the Lok Sabha, India’s parliament. 
Thousands of Indians have taken to the streets to protest against Modi’s policies. And for Indrajit Roy, professor of global development at the University of York in the UK, this pushback by Indians against threats to their democracy is an example of an audacious type of hope. He talks to The Conversation Weekly podcast about what it means to be living in hope, and where he sees examples of that in India.  








For Roy, to live in hope shouldn’t be conflated with aspiration, or with a search for a form of political utopia. 

Hope is a collective emotion … it’s about collectively thinking of how you want to live your life. Hope is also about not giving up. It’s about pursuing a collective objective, despite lots of difficulties and pursuing them without quitting. Hope is necessarily incomplete … it’s imperfect, it’s always a work in progress. 

In a new book called Audacious Hope: an archive of how democracy is being saved in India, Roy charts the ways various Indians have fought back against threats to democracy. 
One prominent example were the countrywide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in 2019. This law, passed in haste in the Indian parliament, gives a fast-track route for citizenship for religious minorities from India’s Muslim-majority neighbours Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. 
While six religions are included, Muslims are not. For Roy, the protests against the law from across Indian society were a good example of audacious hope. 

This was a very clear example of how numerous Indians, despite all odds were out on the streets protesting a divisive law. And I found that almost moving, touching because they didn’t have to do it. For a lot of them, they wouldn’t be touched,  affected by this law at all, perhaps, but it was the principle of a divisive citizenship law which many people were really against.

The protests – and the implementation of the law – were interrupted by the COVID pandemic. But in March 2024, just a few weeks before the election, Modi’s government enacted the law and new protests sprung up.

Honk! These monkeys have truly legendary noses â now we better understand why they evolved,https://theconversation.com/honk-these-monkeys-have-truly-legendary-noses-now-we-better-understand-why-they-evolved-230012,3012589,"Evolution, Primates, Monkeys, Borneo, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Of all the monkey species around the world, one stands out with its large, bizarre nose. In male proboscis monkeys, their bulbous noses will often hang past their mouths.
But why evolve such a strange feature? Are they a visual sign of health and status to potential female mates, and to other males? Or did they evolve to help the monkeys make honks and other loud sounds? 
In our new study, published in Scientific Reports, we have deepened our understanding of these enlarged nasal structures by investigating what lies beneath: the structures in the skull.
Our findings help to explain how these noses function as visual and acoustic signals of health and status. They also add to a growing body of evidence that shows researchers can use  close examinations of skulls to glean information about primate social behaviour.





A battle of noses
One of the largest monkey species in Asia, proboscis monkeys (Nasalis larvatus) are endemic to the island of Borneo. They live in coastal mangroves, peat swamps and riverine forests, and have an unusual diet made up mostly of leaves.
They can swim quite well and have webbed fingers and toes. They typically live in harem groups, made up of a single adult male (who tends to have a large, bulbous nose), some adult females and their offspring.
Males don’t often get the opportunity to attract a harem until they reach middle age. These older, dominant and large-nosed males don’t easily tolerate other large-nosed males, often trying to ward them off aggressively with deep honks and “nasal roars” – loud calls they make using their noses.
Young adult males with smaller noses often live in all-male bachelor groups, and don’t tend to fight aggressively with each other. When these bachelor males get older and become large (and large-nosed) enough to compete with males that are part of a breeding group, they are in a position to overthrow the tenured male. Females then often choose to form a harem group with this new, high-status male.

What’s behind the nose?
We investigated the size and shape of the proboscis monkey nasal cavity. That’s the bony chamber of the skull that sits behind the fleshy nose. Our goal was to find out if the size and shape of the nasal aperture  – the front part of the cavity, where the fleshy nose tissue attaches – can tell us more about why these peculiar appendages evolved.
Previous research that looked at the bulbous nose in males suggests it evolved to advertise status. In our new research, we wanted to better understand how this could be the case, this time using data taken from the skull. 
We used 3D surface models, downloaded from a public repository, to take size and shape measurements from 33 adult proboscis monkey skulls. We compared these with the adult skulls of king colobus monkeys, blue monkeys and crab-eating macaques, three old world monkey species.

We chose some measurements to quantify the nasal cavity, and others to quantify the nasal aperture in all the species. We also looked at tooth wear, since older adult monkeys have more worn teeth than younger adults. That would allow us to find out if older adult males had a larger nasal aperture than younger adult males.
Better honks
If male proboscis monkeys have a different nasal cavity shape to females, and a unique shape compared to the other monkey species, it would support the idea these enhanced nasal structures – both the fleshy nose and the cavity behind it – evolved to allow for more effective honks and nasal roars.
That was indeed what we found. The shape of the male nasal cavity was low and long compared to females. This allows males to build up resonance (sound vibration) in their nasal cavities, allowing them to emit deeper and louder calls through their noses. 
The nasal aperture shape was also different between the sexes. In males, it looks a bit like an eggplant, while in females it looks more like an upside-down pear. This unique opening shape in males allows for higher intensity sounds to be emitted through the nose. 

The sex differences in cavity shape were also larger than what we found in other old world monkey species. This further supports the idea that the nasal cavity of male proboscis monkeys underwent an evolutionary change for the purpose of making certain sounds.
Lastly, the age. Older proboscis monkey males really do have larger nasal apertures than younger adult males, but the cavity itself didn’t increase with age. This supports the idea that the large noses act as a visual signal. It’s also consistent with the fleshy nose size increasing in middle-aged or older adult males, which we know from behavioural studies in the wild.

Our evidence from the skull allows us to better understand how nasal structures in male proboscis monkeys evolved for both acoustic and visual signalling. 
The more we know about how regions of the skull function as social signals, the better chance we have of reconstructing extinct primate social behaviour using fossilised skull remains.

"Bird flu is hitting Australian poultry farms, and the first human case has been reported in Victoria. Hereâs what we know",https://theconversation.com/bird-flu-is-hitting-australian-poultry-farms-and-the-first-human-case-has-been-reported-in-victoria-heres-what-we-know-230691,3012424,"Infectious diseases, Avian flu H5N1, Health, Avian flu, Bird flu, Poultry farms, Health in the news, news analysis","
The first human case of avian influenza (bird flu) in Australia was reported yesterday in Victoria. A child acquired the H5N1 strain of the virus in India and became ill upon returning home to Australia in March this year. 
Based on information made available yesterday on the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), we can ascertain the child is a two-year-old girl. She tested positive in early March and was reportedly very unwell but has since fully recovered.
According to the Victorian Department of Health, contact tracing revealed no additional cases, and the risk to others is very low.

Humans who acquire H5N1 generally have close contact with infected poultry; H5N1 does not spread easily between people. But the fatality rate in human cases is about 50%.





So what should we make of this latest development, as bird flu makes news locally and around the world?
H5N1
There’s no publicly available information on how this child became infected in India, or even where in India this case came from. However, the country is currently facing significant avian flu outbreaks in the states of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra. 

H5N1 is a strain of influenza A, which is further divided into variants called clades. GISAID data shows the virus the child was infected with belongs to the H5N1 clade 2.3.2.1a. The South Asian clade 2.3.2.1a was first identified in 2009 and is still circulating in birds in Bangladesh and India. 
This is different from the clade behind outbreaks in dairy cattle making headlines in the United States (H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b). A second human case in the US associated with this outbreak has just been reported – a dairy worker in Michigan. Globally, a total of 14 human cases have been linked to this clade.
What about the poultry farms?
On the same day we heard about the child with H5N1, a bird flu outbreak was reported at an Australian egg farm in Meredith, Victoria. 
This was a different strain, influenza A H7N3. H7 outbreaks are not new to Australia. The earliest H7 outbreak in Australia was an H7N7 outbreak in Melbourne, Victoria in 1976. The three most recent outbreaks occurred in free-range farms in Lethbridge, Victoria, in 2020. 
While some strains of avian flu tend to produce mild or no visible disease (called low pathogenic), H5N1 and H7N3 are both highly pathogenic viruses. This means they cause severe illness in poultry and wild birds.
Wild birds are the source, and can infect farmed or domestic poultry. They can also infect animals such as pigs and horses. 
Free range farms are at risk of avian flu, as they are outdoors and may be exposed to infected wild birds. But overall there have been very few highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks in Australian poultry, summarised in the table below. 

The strain dominating Europe and the Americas, H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, began in 2020 and spread globally to infect more than 300 avian and 40 mammalian species. 
This is the most worrying clade, as it has spread further and more widely than any other avian flu virus. In mammals and birds it causes severe respiratory disease but also affects the brain.
Some good news
To date, H5N1 has not been detected in birds in Australia. It’s positive news that the egg farm outbreak is H7N3 rather than H5N1. The unrelated H5N1 infection in the child showed no evidence of spread, and the child recovered. 
Australia has historically been protected from highly pathogenic avian flu because it’s spread by migrating ducks, geese and swans (known as waterfowl) from Asia. Their flyways bypass Australia. 
However, with a range of different wild birds now infected by H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b, including in Antarctica, there may be new bird migration routes by which the virus could enter Australia. 
The egg farm outbreak should be controlled quickly by culling infected birds. There are vaccines for poultry, but they are only partially effective and can mask outbreaks, so tend not to be used. France, which has had widespread outbreaks of H5N1 in its farms, began vaccinating poultry recently, but has experienced continued outbreaks.

What needs to happen now?
Past H7 outbreaks have been controlled rapidly in Australia, but we must remain vigilant. Meanwhile, an outbreak of low-pathogenic avian influenza virus H9N2 has been reported in a poultry farm in Western Australia today. The situation is being closely monitored.
There are often delays in reporting and sharing of avian flu data. Information on the child in Victoria was reported almost three months after the event, which is not ideal for preparedness. 
Open source surveillance using publicly available data and intelligence, such as our Epiwatch platform, can provide more rapid information where there may be delays in updates to international reporting databases.
Avian influenza is a global concern, so heightened and timely surveillance in animals, birds and humans is crucial, as is global data sharing. The impact of avian flu on farming and the economy is substantial, but we also worry about a human pandemic arising. 
H5N1 is so widespread globally now that the chance of it mutating to a point where it’s able to spread between humans is higher than ever.

How 17th century refugees used the printing press to fight their oppressors â and laid the foundations of modern humanitarianism,https://theconversation.com/how-17th-century-refugees-used-the-printing-press-to-fight-their-oppressors-and-laid-the-foundations-of-modern-humanitarianism-229043,3012423,"Refugees, Printing press, Protestantism, The Conversation Europe","
For victims of mass violence around the world, attracting foreign media attention can be a matter of life and death. Right now, Palestinian reporters are risking their lives on a daily basis to keep the world’s eyes on the suffering in Gaza, and international coverage has been crucial to receiving humanitarian aid, mobilising widespread protest movements and exerting political pressure on Israel and its allies. 
The Israeli government is also clearly aware of the power of local reporting in swaying public opinion: it continues to obstruct on the ground coverage of the war, and has even allegedly targeted journalists. Simultaneously, it has made great efforts to remind the world of the horrifying details of 7 October in order to counter Hamas’s denial of massacring civilians and generate sympathy for its retaliation.
New research reveals that this struggle for international attention and compassion has a surprisingly long history. Already in the 17th century, oppressed minorities in Europe found the printing press to be a powerful ally in putting the spotlight on their agony. 
To bring foreign audiences to their aid, they faced a difficult question, one that we still grapple with today: how do you make people care about distant suffering? In my new book, I show that in their attempts to answer this question, early modern refugees helped lay the foundations of modern humanitarian culture. 





Lobbying for compassion
European societies first developed a tradition of engaging with distant people’s misery after the Reformation, a time of extreme religious polarisation between, primarily, Catholic and Protestant believers. To combat this fragmentation, many states violently persecuted religious dissidents, causing the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Protestants, Catholics, Anabaptists, Jews, and Muslims. 
Centuries before the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, these refugees had next to no rights. To survive, they depended on the charity and hospitality of religious kin in other parts of Europe.
Uprooted minorities often sent delegates with written testimonies to raise awareness of their plight among potential allies. Initially, this lobbying for support leveraged the established, hostile religious divisions to rally fellow believers. Refugees therefore tended to mix their stories of violence with militant religious rhetoric.
Generating outrage
Practices such as these gradually changed with the rise of news media in the 17th century. As consuming news became commonplace for many Europeans, some persecuted groups realised that they could scale up their campaigns for solidarity by publishing their accounts as pamphlets. 
Moving to print required displaced people to reassess their strategies, as they now had to think more carefully about the diverse audiences they would inevitably reach. In a tempestuous political landscape marked by religious tension, volatile alliances and incessant war, the safest and most far-reaching way to attract support was to highlight one’s suffering without alienating other religious groups in the process.
Abused minorities and their advocates therefore increasingly avoided framing their hardship in religiously polarising terms. Instead, they adopted a more universal rhetoric of compassion, appealing to the rule of law and a sense of shared humanity. This shift in rhetoric would ultimately allow humanitarian engagement to transcend the religious divisions from which it had emerged.
Our shared humanity

Some of these publicity campaigns had sweeping political effects. Take the Waldensians, a Protestant minority in Savoy who suffered a religiously motivated massacre in 1655 at the hands of their sovereign, the Duke of Savoy. After the slaughter – which left some two thousand men, women, and children dead – the survivors fled to France and wrote up eyewitness accounts, which they managed to publish and distribute with the help of the Dutch ambassador in Paris.
The Waldensians provided appallingly detailed reports of rape, torture, and infanticide, and insisted that only people who had “discarded all sentiments of humanity” could “bear to hear this without trembling”. Their story sent shock waves throughout Europe, and successfully mobilised its main Protestant powers. The Dutch Republic, English Commonwealth, and Swiss Reformed Cantons organised large scale charity campaigns to aid the survivors, sent letters of protest to the Duke of Savoy, and dispatched special envoys to Turin to broker a peace deal. 

Then as now, compassion could also lapse into intolerance. Some Dutch Protestants saw the mass killing as proof of the fundamental inhumanity of Catholics, and used it to propose anti-Catholic legislation. In Leiden, an altercation about the Waldensians even ended in violence.
But by foregrounding human (rather than religious) suffering, the Waldensians successfully brought people on side, and retained vital cross-faith support. Catholic France, most notably, offered them asylum and served as mediator during the peace talks. Moreover, this strategy pressured persecuting governments to respond: the Savoyard authorities grudgingly issued a public statement denying the massacre, implicitly recognising foreign audiences as moral arbiters.
New allies
By appealing to humanity in the press, victims of violence did not completely knock down the religious walls separating solidarity networks, but they certainly created cracks. 

In 1745, the Jewish community in Prague managed to cause serious international outrage through reporting about their expulsion at the hands of their queen, Maria Theresia. The queen received a flood of protests from foreign authorities and interest groups, including the Ottoman Sultan, the Pope, the Venetian Senate, the kings of Great Britain, Denmark and Poland, as well as the merchant guilds of London, Amsterdam, and Hamburg. They urged her, in the words of one observer, to uphold the virtues of “humanity, commiseration, love for one’s neighbour, wherever he may be.”
Silence of the press
Today things move faster, as much of the clamour for international attention has moved online: Palestinian journalists like Motaz Azaiza and Bisan Owda have garnered millions of followers on social media, playing a huge role in keeping the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza in the public eye and providing crucial evidence against any efforts to whitewash war crimes and crimes against humanity.
While it cannot solve a crisis on its own, public attention can be instrumental in highlighting, challenging and preventing atrocities. As early modern Europeans already realised, mass violence thrives on the silence of the press.

Politics with Michelle Grattan: Madeleine King on investment incentives and the pivotal role of gas,https://theconversation.com/politics-with-michelle-grattan-madeleine-king-on-investment-incentives-and-the-pivotal-role-of-gas-230772,3012305,"Renewable energy, Nuclear power, Politics with Michelle Grattan, Critical minerals, Madeleine King, Budget 2024, Future Made in Australia Act","
The energy debate has ramped up, with government and opposition trading blows over their respective plans to secure Australia’s energy future. 
The budget announced big tax incentives for green energy projects. Earlier the government embraced the importance of gas up to 2050 and beyond. The Coalition is still promising its yet-to-be-announced nuclear policy, but that took a hit from a sceptical CSIRO report this week.
On the podcast Resources Minister Madeleine King pushes back against Coalition claims the green energy projects – developing green hydrogen, processing critical minerals – should stand on their own feet:  

I think the opposition’s being a bit disingenuous in that regard, given when they were in government they also provided various forms of support to critical minerals projects. It’s very important to acknowledge that they’re not the same resources as the resources we might be used to in Australia. So it’s not iron ore, it’s not coal, which is a huge commodity export of this country. 

King is confident tax-payer money will be going to the right places:






I don’t think there has been any bad money going into the critical minerals sector. They’re projects that have been supported by the former government and I. Some of them, of course, have had their challenges, but they are all projects that are progressing well, and even with some of the international challenges around pricing and market manipulation and, there will be guardrails, of course.
Whilst [the government assistance] incentivises investment and we want to international investment in this story, we want local investment in this story. For each dollar we put in we get more dollars out in terms of the jobs that are created right across the country.

King defends the government’s future gas strategy as a back-up to renewable’s and distances it from the Morrison government’s “gas-led recovery”: 

The future growth strategy doesn’t come with any giveaways to gas companies or any funding at all. It was never intended to and actually never did and never will. It’s a million miles from the gas-led recovery. People [who] want to make that kind of comparison […] should perhaps read the future gas strategy and just look at what it’s based on, which is a thorough analysis. 
Hopefully, there are other technologies like hydrogen that can supplant gas, and that would be great. And that’s what this government is investing in.
The responsibility of the federal government [is] to make sure we have a back up plan. So gas is the insurance on this.

While the opposition points to countries like Canada’s use of nuclear power as a model for Australia, King says it isn’t viable:

I went to Canada recently, and they’re only just sort of getting to the stage of […] disposing of [nuclear waste] permanently. And these reactors have been going for a number of decades. So, it’s hard to underestimate the challenge of nuclear power. I think the CSIRO have estimated the extraordinary cost, and why would you go down that path when it’s simply not needed? 
Canada went down the nuclear path a long time ago, so they continue to use it, and that was their choice. They have a different establishment, they’re closer to North America, they’re able to have the technical cooperation, and I think they also don’t have the access to renewables like we do, given the weather there and the different geography. So it’s just a different story for a different place.

Critical minerals for the world âÂ or just for the US? Turning Australia into a green minerals powerhouse comes with risks,https://theconversation.com/critical-minerals-for-the-world-or-just-for-the-us-turning-australia-into-a-green-minerals-powerhouse-comes-with-risks-230212,3012235,"Mining, Energy, Exports, Environment, US China trade war, green stimulus, green transition, Critical minerals, Inflation Reduction Act, future made in australia","
Globalisation is on shaky ground. As China rises, the United States and its allies are moving to reduce their reliance on the world’s factory. 
The rivalry between the US and China is wide-ranging, from competition in technology over silicon chips and artificial intelligence to the critical minerals essential for green energy technologies such as grid batteries, wind turbines and electric vehicles.
At present, China dominates critical minerals. Beijing has secured supplies of rare earth elements and lithium, which have enabled it to take the lead in many green tech sectors, from solar to EVs. This has heightened geopolitical volatility. 
But it also offers Australia a new pathway to export success – as well as fresh risks. A key part of the government’s flagship Future Made in Australia Act is an effort to fast-track mining of critical minerals – elements such as cobalt and lithium essential to the green energy transition. 
That’s great. But who will buy them? If tensions between the US and China force us to pick a side, we might not be able to export our wealth of critical minerals to China, our largest customer. 

What’s so important about Australia’s critical minerals?
Thermal and metallurgical coal, iron ore and gold have long dominated our mining exports. But this is changing. Under Australian soils are some of the world’s largest recoverable critical mineral deposits, including cobalt, lithium, manganese, rare earth elements, tungsten and vanadium.
Two years ago, the US government introduced the Inflation Reduction Act, an enormous stimulus bill aimed at speeding up the green transition. But it also contains nationalistic elements, prioritising American industries, workers and technologies over foreign competitors. The US also spearheaded a new multilateral Minerals Security Partnership aimed at reducing reliance on China. 
Australia is one of the few mineral suppliers in the partnership. Most members are on the demand side, each with distinct mineral priorities for their industrial, technological and defence needs.
On budget night last week, Treasurer Jim Chalmers said the A$22.7 billion Future Made in Australia package “will help make us an indispensable part of the global economy”.
The framing is clear: Australia will mine and supply critical minerals for nations such as America, which is increasingly integrating us into its plans to reduce reliance on China. 
About $7 billion of the Future Made funding will go to downstream refining and processing of the 31 critical minerals we have in deposits worth mining over the medium term.
These plans do not stand alone. They’re in part a response to other nation’s plans to boost processing and production, especially America, which will need reliable mineral sources to go green. 

Who else is rich in critical minerals? Other middle-power, mineral-rich countries such as Argentina, Chile, Indonesia and Malaysia. These nations, by contrast, do not align their interests as closely with US strategies as Australia does. 
China plays a critical role here as a technology and investment partner, enabling these nations to keep a larger share of economic benefits. 
Mineral-rich countries in Africa and other parts of the global south are focused on attracting investment for mineral extraction and mining to achieve immediate economic returns and infrastructure development. Here, too, China has secured access to many important mines in these regions.
Both groups are competitors to Australia.
Over the past two decades, China has secured diverse sources of minerals and developed advanced mineral recycling technologies to reduce its reliance on the global supply of these resources. 
It has also advanced its processing capabilities for most of these minerals. 
China’s dominance of downstream green tech sectors has given it overcapacity. This enables Beijing to use its market power to significantly influence global supplies of critical minerals.
In response, nations like the US have slapped tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and batteries. 
The risk for Australia
Politically, Australia’s decision to align closely with the US on critical minerals presents substantial risks. 
For instance, to qualify for US government green subsidies, Australian mining companies must ensure Chinese companies or funds hold less than 25% ownership. The world’s largest hard-rock lithium mine, Greenbushes in Western Australia, is 26% owned by China’s Tianqi Lithium Energy. 

As a result, such mining firms are having to reassess their relationship with Chinese companies and entities. 
Chinese battery giants such as CATL and BYD that have partnerships or supply deals with Australian miners may respond by shifting their sourcing 
For decades, Australia has tried to walk a tightrope between America, our military backer, and China, our top customer for minerals and ore. This is becoming less and less possible, as US-China tensions increase. 
If Australia has to pick a side and decouple from China, it will hit our export revenues hard. Finding alternative markets with ore-processing capacities comparable to China’s will be challenging.
China remains a key export destination for Australia’s critical minerals. For instance, 97% of its lithium is exported to China. Lithium exports earned A$11.7 billion in the first half of 2023. Lithium has now overtaken liquefied natural gas (LNG) as Australia’s second-biggest export to China by revenue, behind iron ore.
What about processing the minerals here? To match China here would require massive investment, a large skilled workforce, huge scale and prolonged effort. 
And even if we do, we might end up stuck being able to export these minerals to America and other partnership nations only when supplies from China are disrupted. If that happens, we might be confined to a niche role. 
Can we think differently?
So what should we do? Rather than just competing for a share of green manufacturing, Australia should focus on developing enabling technologies, such as automated production lines and robotics for solar panel and battery manufacturing, as well as next-generation fireproof battery materials. 
If the government takes the lead on building shared-use infrastructure such as laboratory facilities, transport and mineral processing hubs, it will help attract investors, inventors and entrepreneurs by reducing upfront capital costs and operational risks. 
Success in these general-purpose technologies will position Australia as a unique and irreplaceable player in the global critical mineral supply chain.

Scarlett Johanssonâs row with OpenAI reminds us identity is a slippery yet important subject. AI leaves everyoneâs at risk,https://theconversation.com/scarlett-johanssons-row-with-openai-reminds-us-identity-is-a-slippery-yet-important-subject-ai-leaves-everyones-at-risk-230677,3012234,"Privacy law, Privacy rights, Defamation, Identity theft, OpenAI, Scarlett Johansson, ChatGPT","
OpenAI will be removing access to one of its ChatGPT voices, following objections by actor Scarlett Johansson that it sounds “eerily similar” to her own. 
Earlier this week, the company said it was “working to pause” the voice of Sky, which is one of a few options users can choose when conversing with the app. 

Johannson said OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, had approached her in September  and again in May, asking if she would allow her voice to be used in the system. 
She declined, only to hear a voice assistant that sounded uncannily like her only days after the second request. She was, in her own words, “shocked, angered and in disbelief”. OpenAI replied by saying:

AI voices should not deliberately mimic a celebrity’s distinctive voice – Sky’s voice is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice.

Johansson is known to have voiced an AI in the past, for a role in the fictional 2013 film Her – which Altman has declared himself a fan of. He also recently tweeted the word “her” without much further explanation.

Johansson said she had to hire legal counsel to demand the removal of Sky’s voice and information on how the company created it. 
This dispute provides a prescient warning of the future identity harms enabled by AI – harms that could reach any of us at any time.
Identity is a slippery subject
Artificial intelligence is developing at an incredible pace, with OpenAI’s ChatGPT being a game-changer. It’s very likely AI assistants will soon be able to meaningfully converse with users, and even form all sorts of “relationships” with them. This may be why Johansson is concerned.
One thing has become unassailably clear: we can’t out-legislate AI. Instead, we need a right to identity, and with that a right to request the removal, deletion (or otherwise) of content that causes identity harm. 
But what exactly is “identity”? It’s a complex idea. Our identity may say nothing about our specific personal traits or qualities, yet it is fundamental to who we are: something we build through a lifetime’s worth of choices. 
But it’s also about more than how we see ourselves, as celebrities demonstrate. It’s linked to our image. It is collaborative – cultivated and shaped by how others see us. And in this way it can be tied to our personal traits, such as our voice, facial features, or the way we dress.
Minor attacks against our identity may have limited impacts, but they can add up like death by a thousand cuts. 
Legal defences
As AI democratises access to technologies that can manipulate images, audio and video, our identities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to harms not captured by legal protections.
In Australia, school students are already using generative AI to create sexually explicit deepfakes to bully other students.
But unlike deepfakes, most identity harms won’t breach criminal law or draw the ire of the eSafety Commissioner. Most legal avenues afford ill-fitted and piecemeal remedies that can’t heal the damage done. And in many Western democracies, these remedies require legal action that’s more expensive than most can afford.
AI can be used to manipulate or create content that shows “you” doing things you haven’t (or would never do). It could make you appear less competent, or otherwise undermine your reputation. 
It could, for example, make you appear drunk in a professional setting, as with former US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. It could show “you” vaping, when doing so would disqualify you from your sports team, or place you inside a pornographic deepfake video.

Australian law lags behind
The United States Congress recently proposed an actionable right to privacy. But even without this, US protections exceed those offered in Australia. 
In the US, privacy is defended through a combination of legal claims, including the publication of private facts, presenting a subject in a false light, or the misappropriation of likeness (as in, co-opting some part of another’s identity and using it for your own purposes).
Based on the limited facts available, US case law suggests Johansson could succeed in action for misappropriation of likeness. 
One pivotal case from 1988 featured American singer Bette Midler and the Ford Motor Company. Ford wanted to feature the singer’s voice in an ad campaign. When Midler declined, Ford hired a “sound alike” to sing one of Midler’s most famous songs in a way that sounded “as much as possible” like her. 
Midler won, with one court likening Ford’s conduct to that of “the average thief” who simply takes what they can’t buy.
Australian public figures have no equivalent action. In Australia and the UK, the law will intervene where one party seeks to profit by passing off lesser quality look-alikes or sound-alikes as “the real thing”. But this applies only if consumers are misled or if the original suffers a loss. 
Misrepresentation might also apply, but only where consumers believe a connection or endorsement exists. 
Australia needs a rights-based approach akin to that in the European Union, which has a very specific goal: dignity.
Identity or “personality” rights empower those affected and impose an obligation on those publishing digital content. Subjects may receive damages or may seek injunctions to limit the display or distribution of material that undermines their dignity, privacy or self-determination. 
Johansson herself has successfully sued a writer in France on the basis of these protections (although this win was ultimately more symbolic than lucrative).
With AI, it’s now child’s play to impersonate another’s identity. Identity rights are immensely important. Even where these rights co-exist with free speech protections, their very presence enables people to protect their image, name and privacy.

US hostility towards the ICC is nothing new â it has long supported the court only when it suits American interests,https://theconversation.com/us-hostility-towards-the-icc-is-nothing-new-it-has-long-supported-the-court-only-when-it-suits-american-interests-230663,3012063,"United States, Israel, Russia, Joe Biden, Ukraine, Fatou Bensouda, International justice, International Criminal Court (ICC)","
This week, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) applied for arrest warrants for three Hamas leaders, as well as Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, in connection with the ongoing war in Gaza. 
The reaction of the United States, Israel’s main backer, was swift. President Joe Biden condemned the prosecutor’s action against Israel’s leaders as “outrageous” and accused the ICC of drawing false moral equivalence between Hamas and Israel.
While it is not yet clear if the ICC’s judges will decide to issue the warrants for Netanyahu and Gallant, the Biden administration has already hinted at the possibility of imposing US sanctions against ICC officials. 
Yet, just a year ago, when the ICC issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and another Russian official for alleged international crimes in the Ukraine war, US officials were full of praise for the court. Biden welcomed the action, calling it “justified”.





Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in fact, the US has continually displayed its support for the ICC. One top US official, the ambassador-at-large for global criminal justice, said the ICC “occupies an important place in the ecosystem of international justice”. 
The US’ apparent about-face when the court targeted its ally is nothing new. Nor is it surprising. 
Rather, this vacillating approach is merely symptomatic of the US’ complicated relationship with the ICC since its creation in 1998. Its hostile reaction to the Israel-Palestine situation will certainly have been expected by court officials. 

Wariness from the court’s inception
I worked for many years as a cooperation advisor at the ICC’s office of the prosecutor. During that time, Washington’s position towards the court shifted several times – it supported the court at certain times and criticised it at others. 
This has largely been tied to a broader assessment of US foreign policy goals and the anticipated costs and benefits that supporting the court could bring. 
The US was initially a keen supporter of the creation of a permanent international criminal court and was an active participant in the ICC treaty negotiations in the 1990s. 
But it ultimately voted against the Rome Statute that created the court in 1998 due to concerns with the court’s jurisdictional framework. The US feared it could allow for the prosecution of Americans without US consent. 
Although the US still signed the Rome Statute, President George W. Bush later effectively unsigned it, saying the US would not ratify the document and had no legal obligations to it.
The US remains a non-member state to the ICC today.
Once the ICC was created, the US adopted laws to restrict its interactions with the new court. Most importantly, it passed the American Servicemembers’ Protection Act of 2002 (ASPA) that prohibited providing any support to the ICC. 
This law also allowed the US president to use “all means necessary” – a phrase understood to include armed force – to free American officials or servicemembers should they ever be detained for prosecution in The Hague, the seat of the ICC. This earned it the nickname of “The Hague Invasion Act”. 
That same year, however, an amendment was passed to the law allowing exceptions for when the US could assist international courts to bring to justice:

Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama bin Laden, other members of al-Qaeda, leaders of Islamic Jihad and other foreign nationals.

The amendment created significant flexibility, demonstrating that the US was ready to assist international justice efforts as long as they targeted designated US “enemies” or other foreign nationals.
US support in African cases
The US soon adopted a pragmatic approach towards the court, supporting its activities depending on the circumstances and its interests. 
In 2005, Washington allowed a UN Security Council referral to the ICC in relation to possible genocide and war crimes committed in Darfur, Sudan. The conflict was among the US’ top foreign policy priorities in Africa at the time. 
Later, the Obama administration formally adopted a “case-by-case” strategy to cooperate with the ICC when it aligned with US interests. 
Under this policy, the US played an important role in the 2011 referral of alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Libya to the ICC. This was, again, in line with US foreign policy interests. 
US diplomats also provided vital support in the arrest of Congolese warlord Bosco Ntaganda, who was later sentenced to 30 years in prison by the ICC for war crimes and crimes against humanity. And the US assisted with the arrest of Dominic Ongwen of the Lord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, who was later sentenced to 25 years.

Another falling out over Afghanistan
The relationship between the US and the court soon soured again, though, during the Trump administration. 
This was in part because of developments in the ICC’s investigation into alleged crimes committed in Afghanistan, which marked the first time the court probed possible crimes committed by US forces.
In 2020, ICC judges authorised an investigation into US, Afghan and Taliban forces. Soon after, the US imposed sanctions on the ICC prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, and another senior ICC official. 
After some delays, the investigation is continuing again, with a focus solely on crimes allegedly committed by the Taliban and Islamic State Khorasan Province. Other aspects of the investigation have been “deprioritised”, an implicit reference to the US and its allies.

Soon after taking office, the Biden administration lifted the sanctions against the ICC officials, returning to a seemingly more collaborative period in US-ICC relations. 
These relations became closer following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, with the adoption of new laws that broadened the possibilities of US cooperation with the court. The goals of the US and ICC had seemingly aligned again, at least for the time being.
But this week’s request for arrest warrants for Israeli leaders demonstrates yet another shift in the US approach to the court. It continues the pattern of the US supporting the court when it suits it, prioritising its own foreign policy goals over wider international criminal justice efforts.

"Itâs not just retiring athletes who need mental health support â young sportspeople need it, too",https://theconversation.com/its-not-just-retiring-athletes-who-need-mental-health-support-young-sportspeople-need-it-too-230296,3012032,"Psychology, AFL, Mental health, Sport psychology, Sports, Youth mental health, Sport and Society","
Retiring from professional sport can be anguishing for some athletes. 
In Australia, high-profile athletes such as Brendan Cannon, Nathan Bracken, Stephanie Rice and Lauren Jackson have spoken about the loss of identity, purpose and goals for the future, as well as depression and thoughts of suicide after retirement. 
More recently, the death of former Australian Football League (AFL) player Cam McCarthy – who battled mental health issues during his career – brought on calls for more support for athletes during retirement, including from Fremantle coach Justin Longmuir. 
Meanwhile, the sentencing of former St Kilda footballer Sam Fisher for drug offences has driven similar conversations about “life after footy”, as has become the go-to phrase for headline writers.





These discussions about the mental health challenges at the end of an athletic career are important – but there’s a missing piece of the puzzle. 
The danger of the athlete identity
Reaching and maintaining peak performance as an athlete requires immense dedication and discipline. 
As a result, athletes’ identities often become closely linked to their status as sportspeople. This means when something disrupts their ability to play sport, like injury or retirement, serious mental health problems can follow.

The good news is, sporting organisations are increasingly investing in retirement transition programs that support mental health during and after the end of athletes’ careers. 
Programs typically aim to encourage athletes to develop more well-rounded identities, consider future careers and encourage help-seeking when needed.
Such programs are currently being delivered by the AFL, Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and National Rugby League, among others. 
This investment is encouraging. These programs can play important roles in preventing and responding to serious mental health problems among retiring athletes.
But more needs to be done to support athletes’ mental health at the start of their careers.
The importance of early intervention
As with all illnesses, early intervention is key. Taking preventative approaches to mental health is essential to build resilience and prevent symptoms from becoming severe. 
There is a need for greater focus on prevention and early intervention for mental health issues in elite sport.
Elite athletes often have to navigate significant pressures and responsibilities from an early age. For example, the 2020 Tokyo Olympics showcased athletes such as Sky Brown, who competed in skateboarding and won bronze at the age of only 13. 
Importantly, athletes are at the most vulnerable age for mental health problems when they enter elite sport settings, given 75% of these issues develop by age 24. 
Coupled with this, the pressures young athletes face – performance pressure, high training loads, strict lifestyle demands and public and media scrutiny – exist alongside the normal challenges of adolescence: academic pursuits, increasing independence from caregivers, developing a sense of identity and navigating peer relationships and early romantic relationships. 
This is clearly a lot for young people to be managing. 
And yet so far, little emphasis has been given to promoting athlete mental health during this transition. 
Importantly, these efforts need to start from entry into the high-performance system, rather than late in athletes’ careers.
What more can be done?
Our research team at Orygen – a youth mental health organisation – recently developed a framework for promoting mental health during the transition into elite sport. This highlights ways people in sport settings (such as coaches, teammates and staff) can support athlete mental health and wellbeing.
One recommended strategy is ensuring athletes understand the key challenges they’re likely to face throughout their careers. This can be complemented by helping them develop healthy strategies for overcoming these challenges. 
Across the whole-of-sport system, there’s a need to ensure all athletes are valued as people – not just sportspeople. This requires building meaningful relationships in sport and preparing athletes for life beyond the athletic career. 
Importantly, opportunities for mental health support should be provided regularly. Athletes need to know seeking help is part of maintaining optimal health and may even support performance.
Sports organisations are starting to make strides in this area. For example, the AFL delivers a curriculum to all Talent Pathways players on mental health literacy, resilience, stress management and coping, and skills to contribute to a safe and inclusive team culture. 
Similarly, the AIS’s Start Strong program  offers online learning that provides athletes and their parents with important information about the Australian high-performance sport system and topics such as personal values and overcoming obstacles. 
Others, such as the Australian Cricketers’ Association, have begun to offer support for alternative education and career pathways earlier in a player’s career, to ensure they have options after retirement. 
Next steps for everyone
These investments are the way forward but we need to push on with preventing mental health problems from the outset, ensuring athletes are best prepared to perform their roles and live healthy lives – physically and mentally – during their lifetimes. 
And perhaps the rest of us – including sports fans and media – can use recent events and this Olympic and Paralympic year to remember that sportspeople are often in a developmentally critical period of life.

The Vatican is cracking down on miracles. Here are the new rules for âsupernaturalâ occurrences,https://theconversation.com/the-vatican-is-cracking-down-on-miracles-here-are-the-new-rules-for-supernatural-occurrences-230544,3011997,"Catholic church, Vatican, Jesus, Supernatural, Mary, Apparitions","
New norms for differentiating supernatural phenomena from the natural within Roman Catholicism took effect on May 19. 
The new norms arise from the need to evaluate as quickly as possible the supernatural origin or otherwise of an array of phenomena occurring increasingly within the Catholic world and spreading quickly via social media.  
Possible supernatural phenomena include apparitions – especially of Jesus or the Virgin Mary – interior or exterior voices, writings or messages from the beyond, the weeping or bleeding of sacred images, the bleeding of consecrated eucharistic hosts, and so on. Visions of the Virgin Mary, in particular, continue to occur regularly within Catholic Christendom.
The new document neither endorses supernatural phenomena nor rejects them. Rather, it provides a set of criteria and processes by means of which the church can officially discriminate between them and separate the authentic from the fake. So what do we need to know about these norms?





An old document replaced
The new norms replace an earlier document from 1978.
In this 1978 document, the decision whether to approve a phenomenon as supernatural or not was essentially left in the hands of a local authority – in most cases, a diocesan bishop. 
According to criteria, the bishop decided on a choice of two options: supernatural, or not. 

In the case of a judgment that a phenomenon was of supernatural origin, he could permit a public manifestation of devotion to the supernatural phenomenon equivalent to his saying, “for now, nothing stands in the way” (“pro nunc nihil obstat”). 
Under this document, central control of the Vatican was minimal. Local authorities were in control. 
The supernatural is under new management
The new document is intended to more effectively oversee the validation of such events.  
It does so by centralising authorisation, management and control of the supernatural within the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, better known as “the Inquisition”. Any decision bishops or any other authority wish to make has to be submitted to the Dicastery for approval. 
The new document declares the Holy Spirit may:

reach our hearts through certain supernatural occurrences such as apparitions or visions of Christ or the Blessed Virgin.

But the central authority of the church will now decide where, when and how God works, his wonders or miracles to perform.
Overall, God will be shown to be minimally directly intervening in the world.
Six new criteria to judge whether God is involved
Rather than a relatively simple judgment whether an event is supernatural or not, the church now provides six possible ways an event can be classified. 
These range from “nihil obstat” (“nothing stands in the way”) to “declaratio de non supernaturalitate” (“declaration of non-supernaturality”).

But even where a nihil obstat is granted, as a rule, neither a diocesan bishop, nor any conference of bishops, nor the Dicastery itself “will declare that these phenomena are of supernatural origin”. 
In short, a clear declaration of a supernatural event having taken place will virtually never happen (or, at least, unless the Pope intervenes). 
A declaration of non-supernaturality will be made if it is discovered 

the phenomenon was based on fabrication, on an erroneous intention, or on mythomania. 

In short, if a fake or a hoax is discovered. 
Between these two extremes lie four other possible judgments. Although there are positive signs of divine action in each of these, they each indicate increasing worries about credibility. The first two of these concern increasing doubts about the credibility of the phenomenon. The next two concern increasing doubts about the honesty of the people involved. 
What are the new procedures?
If a diocesan bishop, after consultation, believes a supernatural phenomenon requires investigation, he alerts the Dicastery. 
He then convenes an Investigatory Commission to carry out a “trial”. This trial will see witness examinations, sworn depositions, expert analysis of written texts, along with technical-scientific, doctrinal and canonical assessments. It is pretty much the traditional method of the Inquisition in modern dress (or vestments).  

The commission finally makes a judgment on the truth of the matter based on positive and negative criteria.
Positive criteria include the reputation of persons involved, doctrinal orthodoxy, exclusion of fakery and the fruits of Christian life that have resulted from it. 
Negative criteria include the possibility of manifest error, potential doctrinal errors, breeding of division within the church, an overt pursuit of profit, power, fame or social recognition, and the personal and public ethical rectitude of those involved, along with their mental health.
In the light of the commission’s work, the bishop  proposes to the Dicastery a judgment following one of the six ways of classification. The Dicastery then makes a final judgment to be delivered to the bishop, who is obliged to implement the decision and make it public
Catholicism ‘disenchanting’ the world
There is deep concern within the Vatican over misinformation and disinformation about the supernatural.
The document informs us:

Now more than ever, these phenomena involve many people […] and spread rapidly across different regions and many countries. 

The digital world is a place of multiple meanings where the supernatural occupies a space somewhere between reality and unreality. It is a domain where belief is a matter of choice and disbelief is willingly and happily suspended.

Ironically, the outcome of the new norms will be to minimise the number of phenomena recognised as “supernatural” within the Catholic Church. In effect, it will put stricter limits on God’s action within the world. 
The new norms within the church to  manage the supernatural are intended more to “disenchant” the world than further to “enchant” it.

"The Swimmer, Russian thugs, Jesusâ feet: Anne Carsonâs lyrical, surreal new work strategically pricks literary seriousness",https://theconversation.com/the-swimmer-russian-thugs-jesus-feet-anne-carsons-lyrical-surreal-new-work-strategically-pricks-literary-seriousness-226501,3011957,"Literature, Fiction, Poetry, Book reviews, Short stories, Canadian literature","
Wrong Norma, the latest collection of writings (and drawings and facsimiles) by the feted Canadian poet Anne Carson, is a work full of allusions, quotations, references, parody and other forms of stylised evocation. 
Sometimes the allusions are more buried than a quick Google allows for. The opening piece 1=1, for instance, is a meditation on (among other things) swimming. While considering all the swimmable bodies of water that are not being swum in, the narrator eccentrically asserts: 

One by one or all at once, geographically or conceptually, putting aside gleaming Burt Lancaster, someone should be using all that water. 

Out of context, with its campy imperative tone and reference to a mid-century movie star, this could almost be from a poem by the New York poet Frank O’Hara. But the narrator of 1=1 quickly moves on to a more contemporary concern: “refugees in a makeshift plastic boat” – one of a number of references in Wrong Norma to political, ethical or legal concerns.

Review: Wrong Norma – Anne Carson (Jonathan Cape)

But what of Burt Lancaster, whose presence seems enigmatic compared to the morally urgent maritime asylum seekers? 
Lancaster played the lead role in The Swimmer (1968), an adaptation of a story by John Cheever, in which the protagonist seeks to “swim home” across the backyard pools of well-heeled Connecticut. This quasi-surrealist conceit, which brings together the real and the gently fantastic, is an appropriate allusion for Carson’s book, which also inhabits the liminal spaces between everyday reality and the extra-rational categories writers traffic in: the lyrical, the surreal, the absurd, and so on.

At the risk of freighting a fleeting reference with undue significance, The Swimmer – a film about the loss of romantic and social bonds – also seems thematically apposite for Wrong Norma, as each piece in the collection is concerned with connection and its opposite. 
Disconnection might seem, at first glance, to be the work’s modus operandi. The book is made up of a diverse, seemingly unrelated, series of forms and genres: short stories, poems, essays, lectures, dialogues, translations, satirical vignettes and elegies. 
These formally diverse pieces are also conspicuously heterogeneous in their subject matter. The author describes the collection as being 

about different things, like Joseph Conrad, Guantánamo, Flaubert, snow, poverty, Roget’s Thesaurus, my Dad, Saturday night, Sokrates, writing sonnets, forensics, encounters with lovers, the word “idea”, the feet of Jesus, and Russian thugs. 

Random, as a teenager in the noughties might have said. 
But this apparent randomness is given a degree of form by various connections, intended or otherwise. Certain images and phrases reappear, so that they begin to act like motifs. Sure, these images and phrases might themselves appear random – they include bread, weeping, the crossing of legs, foxes, tuna, Virginia Woolf and John Cage – but that is how repetition works. Things, from the insignificant to the culturally resonant, take on importance when they reappear. 
By engaging in these acts of connection (that is, noticing the momentary linking of apparently disparate things), the reader apprehends the tension between connection and disconnection as an overarching theme of the book. 
Other related themes start to make themselves apparent. The thematisation of dialogue, conversation, sentences, translation and language more generally, is ultimately concerned with language’s (and therefore our) ability to make or not make connections between the self and the world, the self and others. These connections – as the buried allusions, apparent non sequiturs, eclectic subject matter and sudden shifts of tone suggest – are not facile or inevitable. As the narrator states in 1=1 (the redundancy of the title being redolent of both meaning and meaninglessness), “Conversation is precarious”. 

Precarious play
According to the psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott, play – of which creativity is a “higher” expression – is also precarious. This precarity is most obvious when a writer abandons, destroys or does not publish work. But we can see it, too, in the subjective experience of reading, which is the vicarious sharing in the play of another. 
Such a “connection” is not inevitable, as made clear by the handful of times when I felt bored and alienated by Carson’s rambling, sometimes opaque narratives. But for the most part, her pieces are oddly compelling. Her status as a poet is underlined by moments of imagistic brilliance, such as the description, in An Evening with Joseph Conrad, of a church congregation: “Everyone sat packed like teeth.” 
In the noirish Eddy, intense moments of lyricism appear out of nowhere: “Calm as linen is the lab at night, lamps on, black winter beating the windows.” Later in the same piece, Carson includes this wintry tableau: 

She looks out her [car] window at a man wrestling three enormous snowflakes out of a box onto his lawn, beside him a plastic snowman tilts on a mound of snow. Man gives her a look. The wires of his snowflakes are terribly tangled. Inside a dark house a dog is barking, barking.

And then there is Carson’s gift for humour and the strategic pricking of literary seriousness. I especially like her paraphrase of a sentence about creativity from Samuel Beckett’s story The End (1946): “Build a little kingdom then shit on it.” 
The ghost of Beckett haunts this collection, not least in Lecture on the History of Skywriting, in which the sky (suitably personified) interviews Godot, that non-appearing presence from Beckett’s landmark play Waiting for Godot (1953). It is a characteristic Carson gag that Godot’s first name should turn out to be Rusty. “So tell me, Rusty,” asks the sky, “how did it all get started, the non-arriving?”
Not arriving, not connecting, is a common feature of this collection: not arriving at a conclusion; not arriving at a meaning; not arriving at the expected destination, and so on. Such non-arrivals, Carson seems to be reminding us, are central to the artistic process.
Tragedy and enigma
Humour and linguistic skill are strong tools for a writer, and I read Wrong Norma primarily for its comedy and images. But tragedy and enigma are present too, especially with regard to capital-H History. 
One of the strangest pieces in Wrong Norma, Todtnauberg, concerns the meeting in 1966 between the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (“a committed Nazi from 1933 until who knows when”) and Paul Celan, the Romanian-born French poet and Holocaust survivor who wrote in German. 
Carson’s poem is named after Celan’s poem about the meeting, a piece that in turn was named after the village in the Black Forest where the meeting took place. At some level, Carson’s poem seems to evoke the ancient argument between philosophy and poetry, which is consistent with the numerous evocations of classical themes and figures throughout Wrong Norma and Carson’s work as a whole – she has had a long career as a professor of Classics.

Carson’s Todtnauberg employs an extreme form of parataxis – a poetic technique that uses juxtaposition without explanation – in response to Celan’s poem, which is similarly paratactic and enigmatic in style. 
Misread as a homage by Heidegger and his students, Celan’s Todtnauberg has been the subject of extensive critical and biographical debate. Carson’s intervention in this debate appears wilfully short and almost simplistic, with its childlike, frankly ugly, drawings and apparent linking of the meeting between the philosopher and poet with Celan’s suicide in 1970. 
Dialogue and misunderstanding, image and narrative, the sayable and the unsayable: Todtnauberg is perhaps the most intense expression of the theme of (dis)connection in Wrong Norma, which is perhaps why I was haunted for days by the question of its import – aesthetic as much as moral. 
In her 2004 Paris Review interview, Carson offers a kind of key to her work when she repeats a maxim from the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan: “The reason we go to poetry is not for wisdom, it is for the dismantling of wisdom.”
Carson’s career has been one of dismantling and reassembling the forms, traditions and texts that she finds fascinating. She is engaged in an ancient dialogue between writers across time and space. Her oeuvre as a whole is one of connection as much as disconnection. 
But her work, with its semi-random use of association and coincidence, also seems to evoke a more mundane and contemporary form of connection and disconnection. The internet, as much as literary history, could be an analogue for her work, in the way that it collapses time and space into instantaneous and seemingly infinite connections and disconnections. 
As such, I wonder if there is a risk that the virtual worlds of writers such as Carson might start to seem a little less strange, a little less absorbing, when their aesthetic has become virtually (in both senses of the word) routine. Perhaps, but at its best, Carson’s routine – to use the word in its stand-up comedy sense – is indeed nothing less than compelling.

Rishi Sunak fires election starting gun with a damp whimper â but Labour will want to play down talk of a landslide,https://theconversation.com/rishi-sunak-fires-election-starting-gun-with-a-damp-whimper-but-labour-will-want-to-play-down-talk-of-a-landslide-230740,3011873,"UK politics, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
“It’s the optics that matter” is a modern cliche of political life. It doesn’t matter what you say so much as how you say it – and where you say it. If this is true, then the early election omens are not good for Rishi Sunak. 
Standing at the lectern, he looked like a schoolboy who’d been sent into the yard for being naughty. Hunched shoulders and sodden smile, he grimaced through a speech that was badly written and far too long.
Where he gave the speech was nowhere unusual – in front of Downing Street like so many other prime ministers before him. Except he did it in the pouring rain, and was thoroughly soaked before he’d even got to the point. The sound of New Labour’s anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” blasting out in the background from a nearby protester’s speaker only added to the sense of the bizarre. 
Never has the starting gun for an election been fired with such a whimper. 





So why now? The immediate reasoning is the economy. Recent inflation figures – 2.3% and not the expected 2.1% – meant that the hope of a June rate cut was a forlorn one. The rationale for playing the long game and pushing back the general election to later in the year was tied to a level of economic optimism which has now been dashed. 
The prospect of more small boats crossing the Channel during the summer months is another very good reason to get this date with destiny out of the way sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, add in a restless party, defections to Labour and a broader sense that no matter what the Conservatives did, the polls would stay stubbornly in Labour’s favour, and the benefits of holding out until October grew thinner and thinner. In the end, waiting until later in the year risked making the Tories’ eventual losses even greater. Sunak must also be exhausted – physically and mentally drained by governing under huge pressures.

A reasonable observer might presume from this situation that there is no way “Rishi can win”. It is indeed the case that a working majority for Labour is currently the most likely outcome once crosses are drawn on ballot papers with stubby pencils in six weeks’ time.    
But – and there has to be a but – talk of a landslide is dangerous hyperbole for those hoping the Labour party will win. Political apathy and any perception of electoral complacency could puncture Labour’s bubble. Being 30 points ahead in the polls is worth nothing unless you can get your supporters into those ballot boxes to make those crosses with those stubby pencils.
The second “but” is that the Labour party has a habit of clinching defeat from the jaws of victory. A second-string element of the Conservative’s long-game strategy was simply hanging onto power in the hope that Labour might self-destruct and implode due to some internal catastrophe, crisis or disaster – or that an unexpected “black swan” event would suddenly leave Labour unelectable and the Tories in pole position. 
The impact of the highly improbable is – as statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb has explained – as hard to predict as it is to mitigate, but are there any black swans flying on the horizon for Labour? 
The answer is yes. The recent local elections in England revealed a severe disconnect between the Labour Party and Muslim communities. In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour’s share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. The Israeli-Palestine war could yet have a significant effect on the next general election. 

Which leads into a third and final reason why talk of a large Labour success needs to be treated with caution – the lack of a connection. Labour may well be ahead in the polls but this does not mean that they are necessarily popular. There is no doubt that the Labour party has pursued a  “ming vase approach”, in the sense that they have made political progress by criticising the Tories while refusing to provide policy details about exactly what they would do in government. 
The issue is that, with an election now called, Labour must transition at pace from an official opposition to a credible “government in waiting”. Criticising the Conservatives is no longer enough, a credible and integrated policy portfolio must now be presented.

Using smart devices to schedule on-demand public transportation can save time and money,https://theconversation.com/using-smart-devices-to-schedule-on-demand-public-transportation-can-save-time-and-money-227101,3011872,"Bus, Quebec, Transportation, Suburbs, Montreal, Bus services, Public transit, On-demand public transit","
Suburban residents often face challenges receiving reliable and accessible bus transit — riders often complain about infrequent schedules and long waiting times. Often, transit agencies are unable to provide additional buses because population density in such areas is usually low.
On-demand transit (ODT) is an innovative transportation approach that enhances the accessibility and quality of service while reducing operating costs.
Despite the rapid growth of ODT services in various cities across Canada and the United States, the mechanism of placing ride-requests with many ODT service providers remains reliant on mobile applications, telephone calls or websites. 
But privacy concerns may lead passengers to be reluctant to use mobile applications for booking a ride. And individuals without access to phones face barriers in accessing these services. 





Real-time information
Our research investigates the potential of ODT by simulating a novel configuration that uses smart devices installed at bus stops. Smart City Network (SCiNe) devices are used for local communication with passengers that also provide them with real-time information. Prototypes of SCiNe devices, developed by BusPas, Inc., have been installed at bus stops in Montréal and Laval, Qué.

SCiNe devices provide useful information, such as estimated arrival time, potential delays and the number of passengers on transit services. Providing such real-time information can improve passenger satisfaction while enabling transit agencies to make data-driven decisions that optimize operations.
With such a proposed configuration, passengers at a bus stop equipped with a SCiNe use the device to request a ride. Upon receiving a request from the passenger, each SCiNe sends the transit agency information, including bus stop location, request time and destination location. 
The agency also receives real-time data from the fleet of vehicles, mainly vans, travelling across the network. This data allows it to be continuously aware of the status of vehicles in terms of availability, current position, requested locations and routes. 
Optimizing schedules and routes
The real-time data received from vehicles and SCiNes are transmitted to the dispatching algorithm. 
The dispatching algorithm is responsible for dynamically matching passengers to available vehicles by taking different parameters into account such as wait and detour times. The algorithm also considers how two or multiple requests can be addressed simultaneously. 
When allocating rides to passengers, the algorithm considers vehicle availability, the proximity of passenger location and the expected duration of the trip. Once a vehicle is assigned to a passenger, the algorithm determines the optimal route for the vehicle to reach them. In order to select the best route, it takes real-time traffic conditions, distance and estimated travel time into account.
The dispatching algorithm assigns vehicles to passengers, and passengers receive personalized information through the SCiNes, which includes the estimated waiting time. Vehicles also receive information on the passengers who need to be picked up and the bus stop locations.
Implementing on-demand services
The proposed configuration was implemented to simulate ODT service for the first-mile, which is the initial leg of a commuter’s journey. Terrebonne, a suburb of Montréal, was selected as the study area, and the proposed ODT service was compared with the existing bus transit service operating there.
Our simulation results suggest that if such an ODT service were available, transit users would result in reduced travel times compared to using a regular bus service. ODT streamlines getting around on public transit, making travel quicker and smoother.
Were such a system to be developed and adopted on a large scale, ODT could have a big impact on the organization and performance of suburban transit provision. Using innovative technologies, such as SCiNe devices and sophisticated dispatching algorithms, ODT offers a potential method to improve accessibility, reduce commute times and enhance the overall experience of transit users.

How to end the wasteful boom-bust cycle driving NZâs infrastructure gap: new report,https://theconversation.com/how-to-end-the-wasteful-boom-bust-cycle-driving-nzs-infrastructure-gap-new-report-230398,3011851,"New Zealand, Infrastructure, Value capture","
Debates about infrastructure often turn around money – with good reason. It’s estimated New Zealand’s infrastructure deficit – the amount we would need to spend to modernise, upgrade and build what we need today – is more than NZ$100 billion. 
And this will double by 2030 if we don’t significantly increase spending now to avoid the even higher cost of falling further behind and having to catch up.
These are big numbers, but they are just numbers. The real problem is political. No matter which major party is in office, no recent government has seriously addressed the country’s long-term infrastructure needs.
Priorities should include modernising water systems to prevent leaks and contamination, expanding and improving road and rail networks to reduce congestion and support economic growth, and ensuring infrastructure can withstand the impacts of climate change and natural disasters.





Next week’s budget seems likely to continue the trend. Spending and tax cuts, and reducing debt, have already been well signalled. Building a few more big roads and installing tunnels and pipes is no substitute for what is truly required.
A report made available to media today from the Helen Clark Foundation and environmental consulting firm WSP – Bridging the Infrastructure Gap: Funding and Financing Aotearoa New Zealand – argues there is a better way. Central to this will be greater political consensus and longer-term planning. 

Wasteful and unproductive
While there are several ways to fund infrastructure, the report argues a significant portion will need debt financing. And it reminds us New Zealand is still a reasonably low-debt nation.
As of 2022, Crown debt sat at around 57% of GDP, compared to an OECD average of 89%. Given the strong Crown balance sheet, there is capacity for further government borrowing for infrastructure projects.
As the report argues, however, money isn’t the real problem – political willpower is. Above all, there is a lack of multiparty support for prioritising a resilient future.
This became starkly evident with the recent change of government. Since the National-led coalition took office, we’ve seen infrastructure project cancellations and a significant shift in funding priorities. 
As the Clark Foundation report highlights, the incoming government cancelled the iReX interisland ferry terminal project after $424 million had already been spent. Similarly, the previous Labour-led governments cancelled eight major road projects. Some of these have now been reinstated at a significantly higher cost.
This boom-bust cycle is wasteful and unproductive. The report emphasises the need for a stable, long-term vision supported by consistent investment levels across successive government terms. 
Historically, this cycle has also led to many infrastructure assets reaching the end of their lives all at once. The need for substantial repairs or replacement leads in turn to urgent spending that could be avoided with better planning.
Big savings available
The lack of a long-term vision carries other costs, too. The decisions made today will affect multiple future generations. It is irresponsible to make critical, long-term, high-impact decisions about vital infrastructure on a three-year political cycle. 
The Clark Foundation report recommends developing a 30-year national infrastructure plan. Not only would this provide greater certainty, it would unlock productivity benefits that could save between 13% and 26.5% on project costs.
But spending more and building more isn’t the only way to sustain infrastructure. We also need to use – and charge for – existing infrastructure more efficiently. There are examples of this already, such as a planned time-of-use charge for some Auckland roads, but far more can be done.
Other possibilities include new highway tolls and more targeted water-use charges. For instance, “volumetric charging” – metering – for water has had significant success on the Kāpiti Coast where it led to a 90% reduction in water lost to leakage, and a 26% decrease in private water use.

Transcending the political cycle
There are also more innovative and equitable ways to fund infrastructure that have long been used globally, including what is known as “value capture”. This is where an increase in rates revenue resulting from an infrastructure investment is used to fund or offset some of the cost of the infrastructure itself.
For example, in the United States, value-capture mechanisms were integral to funding the development of the Atlanta BeltLine, a 35-kilometre walking and cycling path, and eventual light rail route. Capturing the increase in property values along the corridor provided 40% of the project’s US$4.8 billion cost.
Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway (MTR) Corporation has successfully used value capture through land premiums and property development to fund its extensive rail network. 
And in London, the Crossrail project (also known as the Elizabeth Line) partially funded its construction through a business rate supplement and a community infrastructure levy targeting properties that would benefit from the new rail line.
In New Zealand, targeted rates – a form of value capture – have been successfully used to fund projects such as the $400 Moa Point Sludge Minimisation Facility in Wellington. Financed through a levy on all city properties (excluding protected Māori land), the cost is spread over the life of the new facility.
It is not that feasible funding solutions for significant infrastructure investments don’t exist. Rather, as the Helen Clark Foundation and WSP report makes clear, it is the lack of a long-term plan transcending the political cycle that is holding the country back.

Bridging the Infrastructure Gap: Funding and Financing Aotearoa New Zealand will be publicly available on June 26.

Why the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion is a bad deal for Canadians ,https://theconversation.com/why-the-trans-mountain-pipeline-expansion-is-a-bad-deal-for-canadians-and-the-world-229854,3011828,"Fossil fuels, Climate change, Federal Government, Global warming, Oil and gas, British Columbia, Tar sands, Alberta, Fossil fuel subsidies, Trans Mountain Pipeline, Federal government Canada","
Earlier this month the Trans Mountain expansion project (TMX) — the heavy oil pipeline connecting Edmonton, Alta. and Burnaby, B.C. — began operations. The oil industry argues that the project will boost revenues and stabilize the industry over the long term. The federal government claims that the project will create a “fair price” for Canadian heavy oil.
But what, among the claims, are the facts?
The federal government nationalized the TMX project in 2018 with the acquisition of its corporate owner Trans Mountain  which became a federal Crown corporation. Ottawa framed this decision around a short-term desire to address financial and investor “crises” and push forward with what it viewed as a key Canadian asset.
Since then, the project has faced many additional delays due to legal challenges, the permitting process, engineering difficulties, route changes, extreme weather (including massive flooding and landslides in 2021) and “technical issues”.





The expansion project was first projected to cost $5.4 billion in 2013. In reality, the bill for the project in 2023 came to an astonishing $30.9 billion, and the final cost is yet to be disclosed. 
It is important to push through the rhetoric and engage in some sober reflection, lest we fall prey to collective amnesia or misleading and rosy musings about the pipeline’s long-term profitability.
How we got here
When the federal government intervened in 2018, the project was facing “unquantifiable risk,” according to pipeline company — and the project’s previous owner — Kinder Morgan. 
Sustained resistance from the Government of British Columbia and multiple Indigenous nations compounded the project’s risks which — alongside ballooning costs — made it increasingly unviable for Kinder Morgan. The sale of the project could cost taxpayers $17 billion. 
While the federal government promised no more federal funding in early 2022, further analysis showed “additional cost overruns cannot be financed without government backing”.

In May 2022, it was reported that the six largest banks in Canada provided a $10-billion loan with a guarantee from Finance Canada. In other words, taxpayers continued to take on more financial risk for a project which further jeopardized Canada’s long-term climate goals. 
Since the government purchased the project it has only become clearer that it is not commercially viable. The federal government’s own analysis in 2022 projected that TMX will deliver a net loss for the government. 
Subsidizing fossil fuels
Increased tolls for companies transporting heavy oil through the pipeline could make up for some of the project’s losses. However, these tolls cover only a portion of the costs and oil companies like Cenovus continue to vehemently oppose raising tolls on the pipeline, though this decision will ultimately fall to the federal energy regulator. 
The federal government’s decision-making around the TMX is reminiscent of other failed — and publicly funded — megaprojects with clear parallels to the Site C Dam project in B.C. Even more striking is the comparison to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador. 
A commission established by the government of Newfoundland and Labrador described Muskrat Falls as a “misguided project” driven by “a combination of unrealistic optimism, a willingness to misrepresent costs, schedule and risk, and an inability to change course when things were going wrong”. The same could easily be said about the TMX. 

The TMX is the government’s largest ever fossil fuel subsidy, despite claims otherwise. Indeed, to use the government’s own language, the TMX should be classed as an “inefficient” fossil fuel subsidy which will “encourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change.”
Though the federal government has not been transparent, estimates suggest the government and federal Crown corporations provided over $18.6 billion in total fossil fuel subsidies in 2023, including $8 billion in loan guarantees for the TMX.
What’s next?
TMX has long been called a “Faustian bargain” as building new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in future carbon pollution and bets on the continued expansion of the oil sands. 
Put simply, to continue investing in oil sands expansion is to invest in a world of climate chaos. To force young taxpayers to help fund the future chaos that will disproportionately affect them is particularly galling.
If the world succeeds in addressing the climate crisis, Canada’s oil and gas rapidly becomes uneconomic, with an enormous risk of stranded assets estimated at US$100 billion for physical assets alone. The assets most at risk are the  most expensive and carbon polluting to produce, like the oil transported by TMX.

The federal government now faces the impossible task of successfully offloading the project. Despite the government’s promises for ownership schemes in partnership with industry and Indigenous nations and communities, the project has become much less appealing to private companies. Even less clear are the risks and costs that potential future Indigenous owners bear, including the significant risk of stranded assets as fossil fuel infrastructure loses its economic value.
Abandoning the project would be politically disastrous for the Liberals with an upcoming federal election. However, it will be economically disastrous regardless — the question is for whom.

Rishi Sunakâs fires election starting gun with a damp whimper â but Labour will want to play down talk of a landslide,https://theconversation.com/rishi-sunaks-fires-election-starting-gun-with-a-damp-whimper-but-labour-will-want-to-play-down-talk-of-a-landslide-230740,3011827,"UK politics, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
“It’s the optics that matter” is a modern cliche of political life. It doesn’t matter what you say so much as how you say it – and where you say it. If this is true, then the early election omens are not good for Rishi Sunak. 
Standing at the lectern, he looked like a schoolboy who’d been sent into the yard for being naughty. Hunched shoulders and sodden smile, he grimaced through a speech that was badly written and far too long.
Where he gave the speech was nowhere unusual – in front of Downing Street like so many other prime ministers before him. Except he did it in the pouring rain, and was thoroughly soaked before he’d even got to the point. The sound of New Labour’s anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” blasting out in the background from a nearby protester’s speaker only added to the sense of the bizarre. 
Never has the starting gun for an election been fired with such a whimper. 





So why now? The immediate reasoning is the economy. Recent inflation figures – 2.3% and not the expected 2.1% – meant that the hope of a June rate cut was a forlorn one. The rationale for playing the long game and pushing back the general election to later in the year was tied to a level of economic optimism which has now been dashed. 
The prospect of more small boats crossing the Channel during the summer months is another very good reason to get this date with destiny out of the way sooner rather than later. Meanwhile, add in a restless party, defections to Labour and a broader sense that no matter what the Conservatives did, the polls would stay stubbornly in Labour’s favour, and the benefits of holding out until October grew thinner and thinner. In the end, waiting until later in the year risked making the Tories’ eventual losses even greater. Sunak must also be exhausted – physically and mentally drained by governing under huge pressures.

A reasonable observer might presume from this situation that there is no way “Rishi can win”. It is indeed the case that a working majority for Labour is currently the most likely outcome once crosses are drawn on ballot papers with stubby pencils in six weeks’ time.    
But – and there has to be a but – talk of a landslide is dangerous hyperbole for those hoping the Labour party will win. Political apathy and any perception of electoral complacency could puncture Labour’s bubble. Being 30 points ahead in the polls is worth nothing unless you can get your supporters into those ballot boxes to make those crosses with those stubby pencils.
The second “but” is that the Labour party has a habit of clinching defeat from the jaws of victory. A second-string element of the Conservative’s long-game strategy was simply hanging onto power in the hope that Labour might self-destruct and implode due to some internal catastrophe, crisis or disaster – or that an unexpected “black swan” event would suddenly leave Labour unelectable and the Tories in pole position. 
The impact of the highly improbable is – as statistician Nassim Nicholas Taleb has explained – as hard to predict as it is to mitigate, but are there any black swans flying on the horizon for Labour? 
The answer is yes. The recent local elections in England revealed a severe disconnect between the Labour Party and Muslim communities. In 58 local council wards analysed by the BBC, where more than one-in-five residents identify as Muslim, Labour’s share of the vote was 21% down on 2021, the last time most seats were contested. The Israeli-Palestine war could yet have a significant effect on the next general election. 

Which leads into a third and final reason why talk of a large Labour success needs to be treated with caution – the lack of a connection. Labour may well be ahead in the polls but this does not mean that they are necessarily popular. There is no doubt that the Labour party has pursued a  “ming vase approach”, in the sense that they have made political progress by criticising the Tories while refusing to provide policy details about exactly what they would do in government. 
The issue is that, with an election now called, Labour must transition at pace from an official opposition to a credible “government in waiting”. Criticising the Conservatives is no longer enough, a credible and integrated policy portfolio must now be presented. 
Labour is likely to win. But nothing is guaranteed.

âFacebook probably knows I sell drugsâ â how young peopleâs digital footprints can threaten their future prospects,https://theconversation.com/facebook-probably-knows-i-sell-drugs-how-young-peoples-digital-footprints-can-threaten-their-future-prospects-229994,3011794,"Facebook, Social media, New Zealand, Instagram, WhatsApp, Data harvesting, Data theft, Meta, Social media privacy","
Social media and messaging apps such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Messenger are increasingly used to buy and sell drugs in many countries. New Zealand is no exception.
This trend is particularly popular among young people, who are often involved in trading recreational drugs such as cannabis and MDMA. These deals are generally small scale, which means people believe the risks of getting caught and facing legal action are low. 
But our new research shows how drug-linked “digital trace data” may lead to unexpected consequences in the future. Young people could see their data sold and used against them by job recruiters, insurance companies and others for decades to come.
Data harvesting is the new normal
Social media companies such as Meta are among the largest and most aggressive harvesters of user data. 





These companies collect data on users beyond the confines of their platforms, generating profiles on individuals they can use to target advertising or sell to third-parties. 
We interviewed 33 people as part of our study of social media drug trading in New Zealand. Participants had varying experiences buying and selling drugs via apps. 
A core question we were interested in was how our interviewees navigated security and digital trace data as part of their drug trading. 
Many participants were aware of and concerned about the impact a potential criminal record could have on their lives. 
They also felt the collection of their digital trace data by social media companies could become another potential source of exposure to police, who can request their data  from these companies. As one participant said: 

Facebook probably knows I sell drugs.

But concerns went beyond just law enforcement. Some participants accepted their digital trace data could be used by other groups:

my data has been bought and sold 1,000 times by now, I don’t care what company has it anymore. 

Some of our interviewees also reported receiving targeted adverts related to drug use on Meta platforms, ranging from cannabis edibles to rehab clinics. 
This raises questions around how drug-linked digital trace data may influence different areas of people’s lives as it’s absorbed into the global data trade. 
Increasingly, a person’s digital trace data is being accessed by different groups, from recruitment and insurance companies to law enforcement agencies. 

Data may become the new criminal record
Criminal records have long had an impact on employment, housing access, insurance, loans and travel opportunities – also known as “collateral consequences”. 
The 2004 Criminal Records Act included the clean slate scheme which allows eligible New Zealanders to request their criminal records be concealed from employers and third parties.
The scheme is meant to give hope to people grappling with the consequences of criminal records for minor offences, often committed in their youth. But critics have argued it doesn’t really work as intended in the digital age. 
Today, archived digital content, such as media reports of an offence, often remain easily searched and accessible after official records have been removed. 
But the rise of big data and the use of algorithms to analyse digital trace data sets and predict consumer behaviour further complicates this picture. Big data analytics are spreading beyond advertising into other private sectors such as insurance. This means the collateral consequences of criminal records – and any illegal behaviour – are expanding.
Collateral consequences in the age of big data
The fact our research participants viewed themselves as having a low risk of being caught by police is unsurprising, given the small scale of their drug trading. 
But the collection and sale of digital trace data as part of social media drug deals means we need to broaden the understanding of collateral consequences beyond criminal records. 
The spread of big data and predictive algorithms shows how criminal convictions could become just one of many sources of collateral consequences for individuals.
The targeted advertising of drug-related products and services to some participants in our research highlights how labels such as “drug consumer” may be applied to people based on their digital trace data. There is a high likelihood this classification will feed into other data sets as they are sold on to third parties. 
And given the long-term storage of data by many public and private groups, it may well be that data gathered about an individual when they were 18 continues to affect them when they are 35. 
These data sets may end up causing collateral consequences similar to criminal records, regardless of whether or not there was a criminal conviction.
The global data trade is likely to affect all of us in some form. But it may have a particularly harsh impact on people whose digital trace data links them to behaviours such as drug use or minor offending such as small-scale drug trading.

Peter Dutton wants to cut migration for the sake of housing. Hereâs why thatâs not a good idea,https://theconversation.com/peter-dutton-wants-to-cut-migration-for-the-sake-of-housing-heres-why-thats-not-a-good-idea-230298,3011689,"Housing, Immigration, Migration, International students, Society, Skilled migration, Housing crisis, Visas, Migration policy, temporary visa holders","
Opposition Leader Peter Dutton has suggested the level of Australia’s permanent migration program be reduced from 185,000 – as proposed by the government in the budget – to 145,000. This is a significant reduction.
His rationale is extremely simple: fewer migrants means fewer people needing housing amid a housing crisis. 
As tempting as this logic may be, it’s misleading to suggest issues around migration or housing are easy to fix. Far from it.
Instead, these measures could be counterproductive, leaving us with fewer people to fill important skill shortages and ultimately doing little to manage population growth.





Bidding for skills
Under the current system, there are two main streams of migration: family and skilled. Dutton’s announcement has prompted questions about which sorts of migrants would be cut. 
As the number of new permanent residents in the family stream is dominated by the partners and dependent children of Australian citizens who have a legal right to Australian residence, Dutton’s proposed cut would have to come overwhelmingly from the skilled stream.

At present, the leading occupations in the skilled stream are nurses, teachers, IT workers and engineers. These are all occupations in high demand. If intake of these professions were cut, employers would need to look for alternative sources of people with these skills. This would be bad news for New Zealand, as Australian state governments would likely target its nurses and teachers. 
In addition, state and territory governments would engage in a bidding war for people with these skills. The effect of this would be no decrease in housing demand in the states that won this war and empty houses in the states that lost. 
This is not a solution to the housing crisis, which is due mainly to lack of adequate supply. 
Also, more than 50% of people granted permanent residence are already living in Australia. Their conversion to permanent residence onshore does not free up housing.
Temporary vs permanent
For the past 18 years, the level of Australia’s permanent migration program has fluctuated in the narrow range of 160,000 to 195,000 under seven different prime ministers, beginning with John Howard. This has proven to be a successful, bipartisan policy, leading to the slowing of population ageing, maintenance of a high employment to population ratio (fewer dependants for each worker), and the provision of skills needed for economic development.
Much of the concern about immigration levels has arisen because net overseas migration, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, hit 518,000 in 2022–23. This is an extraordinarily high number by historical standards. 
It is not well understood that almost all this net movement (90%) related to temporary residents, not permanent residents. This is important because temporary residents differ in many ways from permanent residents.

Excluding tourists and New Zealand citizens, there are around 1.7 million temporary residents in Australia. They are not eligible for most government services including Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, the National Disability Insurance Scheme, state education, domestic tertiary fees and many more. Temporary residents do not buy houses. 
While temporary residents are in the housing rental market, most are mainly in dedicated student or backpacker housing, or live with a higher number of people per dwelling than the permanent population.
The differences between temporary and permanent residents are not taken into account in the calculations made for planning documents such as government budgets and intergenerational reports. It is primarily the permanent population that contributes to economic development and productivity. Planning and understanding would be greatly enhanced if the Bureau of Statistics divided the estimated resident population into permanent and temporary components.
Temporary arrivals in 2022–23 were about 200,000 higher than in 2018–19, the last pre-COVID year. This was due to the COVID-induced backlog of students and working holidaymakers wanting to come to Australia all arriving in the same year, along with the normal annual intake. 
Temporary departures were about 100,000 fewer in 2022–23 than in 2028–19 due to an explosion of people switching between visas (known as “visa hopping”) onshore. 

In 2022–23, an astounding 192,000 people on student and graduate visas hopped to the temporary employment visa (408), which gave them an additional two years’ residence. Eligibility for the 408 visa was extended during COVID to provide a means of employment for temporary residents stuck in Australia, but this figure was for the period after COVID.  
In March 2024, around 40,000 former working holidaymakers were on the 408 visa or a bridging visa, the first time working holidaymakers have joined the visa-hopping bandwagon. If these visa hoppers had left Australia in 2022–23 rather than visa hopping, the net migration outcome would have been very different.
What about international students?
Both major parties have proposed caps on Australia’s international student intake.
The number of people on student visas in Australia at the end of March 2024 was only marginally higher than the pre-COVID peak. And the present number is high likely because of the backlog of enrolments created by COVID border closures. 
Dealing with dodgy educational institutions that exploit international students is important, as is the genuine student test introduced by Labor, but capping numbers attending respectable universities is unnecessary and will likely have negative consequences. There could be staff reductions, the dropping of courses and a reduction in the level of university research.
So what could be done to manage migration more effectively?
The government could start by maintaining the permanent migration program at its 18-year average level. Instead of cutting from the overall intake, severely curtailing visa hopping by accepting fewer visa applications from people already in the country would better manage population growth.
This, combined with leaving international student intake as it is and cracking down on dodgy educational organisations, would be more useful than the current proposals from both major parties. 
The Bureau of Statistics should also divide the estimated resident population into permanent and temporary components. This data would help create better migration planning and policy.

New research suggests girls in single-sex schools do slightly better in exams than girls in co-ed environments,https://theconversation.com/new-research-suggests-girls-in-single-sex-schools-do-slightly-better-in-exams-than-girls-in-co-ed-environments-230425,3011688,"Schools, High school, girls schools, single sex education","
Students at all-girls’ schools do slightly better in their exams than girls at co-educational schools, according to new research from the United Kingdom. 
This goes against previous studies that suggest it does not matter if students attend single-sex or co-ed schools.  
What is the study?
This research was done by FFT Education Datalab. This is an independent research team specialising in education policy and statistics. 
Using the United Kingdom’s National Pupil Database, the study  looked at more than 580,000 students who attended more than 3,200 schools. All schools were government-funded (so were “public schools” in Australian termimology) and were either single sex or co-ed. 





Students exam results were examined at the end of Year 11 and the study controlled for differences in schools and pupil characteristics, such as socioeconomic disadvantage or high levels of students who learned English as a second language. 

What did the research find?
The research found girls who went to all-girls’ schools recorded a small improvement in their exam results compared to their peers in co-educational schools. 
This is after adjusting their results to account for factors such as disadvantage. 
The gap is small – around one month’s progress for each of the students. But it is noticeable. 
Yet for boys’ schools, there wasn’t any difference in results between single sex and co-ed schools.
Why is this important?
While the UK study was not peer-reviewed, this finding is important because it contradicts other recent large-scale research, which has found no statistically significant academic advantage to single-sex schooling. 
For example, a 2022 analysis of Irish students found no significant performance gaps between co-educational and single-sex schools. 
A 2014 meta-analysis (an overview of many studies) across 21 countries also found no high-quality evidence of benefits to single-sex schooling. 
What about Australia?
This new research plays into the renewed debate over single sex schooling in Australia in recent months. 
This follows some prestigious all boys’ schools announcing moves to co-education (and some former students crying about the change). It also follows multiple examples of sexism and misogyny by male students at both all-boys and co-ed schools. 
There is also a growing body of Australian research examining toxic behaviour of boys towards their female teachers and peers. 
So the UK research could further entrench a perception girls are better off in single-sex schools.  
This perception has a long history. Many girls schools were set up in the 1800s by pioneering headmistresses such as English educator Frances Buss, who believed in girls’ equal rights to education and girls’ schools were the best places to provide this. 
Girls’ schools today retain an image of feminist progressivism, promoting the idea that “girls can achieve anything”. The perception is supported by some research evidence that girls in single-sex schools are more likely to feel confident in traditionally male-dominated subjects such as STEM. 

What needs to be done?
This UK study raises many questions. Are girls indeed better off on their own? Are there aspects of single-sex education that could be applied in co-ed environments? How do we ensure that all schools are schools of choice for girls, including coeducational schools? 
We can investigate these questions further by doing research with families to better understand their perceptions and experiences of single-sex schools today. We can also do more research into the impact of programs such as Respectful Relationships, which have been introduced to build positive gender cultures in schools.

In 2021, the coach of the Perth-based West Coast Eagles Australian rules football team said recruits who attended public schools and came from single-parent families are too costly to manage off-field and the club might be better off concentrating on private school boys from stable families. 
His comments came a year after a Western Australian parliamentary inquiry found  elite private schools had provided 30 to 40% of the state’s AFL draftees in the previous three years, even though they accounted for only seven of the state’s 300 secondary schools. 
The committee was alarmed that state government funding for football development was going disproportionately to the elite schools, giving boys from those schools an “unfair advantage”. The great Indigenous player Dale Kickett observed that football is one of the few careers in which the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous kids was narrowing. 
If the opportunity to play at the top level were taken away, said Kickett, the competition would become just “a bunch of rich kids playing each other”. Others pointed out that the West Coast Eagles’ two most infamous players, plagued with drug problems, were educated at private schools.

Elite domination of sport is not confined to Australian football. The encroachment of privilege into sport is particularly evident in the sports that have a higher social status – rugby (but not rugby league), rowing, tennis, sailing, equestrian and cricket. 
In England, private schools accounting for 7% of high school students supplied 40% of England’s test match batters born between 1986 and 1999 and 31% of test match bowlers. 
In Australia, after a sharp increase in the 1990s, the share of privately
educated players in Ashes cricket teams has been hovering around 45%.
Sporting hothouses
If top-class players are made by intensive coaching as teenagers, this is not surprising when we see the lavish sporting facilities at schools such as Wesley College in Melbourne and the King’s School in Parramatta, which boasts of its 17 sporting fields.
It’s true around 40% of high school students in Australia are enrolled in private schools. However, there is a very wide gap in fees, facilities and prestige from the lowest (mostly in the Catholic system) to the highest (mostly non-evangelical Protestant schools). The elite private schools in Australia – including the elite 11 members of the Associated Public Schools grouping in Melbourne, the eight belonging to Sydney’s Great Public Schools grouping plus a couple of dozen others – correspond to the private sector in England. 
Not only in Western Australia have elite schools come to dominate the top ranks of Australian rules football, once seen as the sporting code that crossed all class barriers. 
The 11 APS schools (around 0.2% of all high schools in Victoria) provide around a quarter of players drafted into AFL clubs each year. In 2019, Caulfield Grammar alone (fees A$35,746 annually in Year 12 at the time of writing) was the source of 19 AFL players in the league. Haileybury (A$35,920 at the time of writing) supplied 20 players.

In addition to top-class facilities and coaches drawn from the ranks of celebrated former players, one of the key factors has been the decision from around 2000 to aggressively recruit talented teenagers from state schools and put them on scholarships. Using the talents of working-class kids to enhance the reputation of privileged schools is similar to the function of Indigenous scholarships. In fact, the two often overlap.

Children with wealthy parents and sporting talent are especially prized. Beyond its “outstanding sporting facilities”, Sydney’s Knox Grammar offers a special program to support “high-performance student athletes considering a career in elite sport”. They are promised personalised one-on-one mentoring by high-performance coaches, an individual performance plan and regular visits from experts.
The gap between sporting facilities available to children from families of modest means and those from wealthy families is widening. While cashed-up private schools have been using tax-deductible donations from well-heeled alumni to build state-of-the-art Olympic swimming pools, local councils across Australia have been closing municipal pools because they cannot afford to maintain them.
Across most sports, the arrival of more Indigenous players and the elevation of women’s sports in traditional male bastions such as cricket, AFL and rugby has been welcomed. Yet the growing domination of the top levels of these sports by young people passing through the hothouses of elite schools suggests that improving gender and ethnic diversity is camouflaging declining “class” diversity.
Hogging society’s highest symbols of esteem.
In Australia, perhaps no form of symbolic capital is purer than an Order of Australia. It has four levels, Companion (AC), Officer (AO), Member (AM) and Medal (OAM), in descending order. ACs are rare, often fewer than 10 in a year, and highly coveted.
AOs are highly regarded and difficult to obtain, with around 100 awarded each year. AMs are awarded for service to a particular field and are more common. OAMs are given mostly to volunteers at local sports clubs, youth groups, charities, and so on.
Decisions are made by the Council of the Order of Australia, comprising a diverse membership of well-regarded community members and state government representatives. The Council commissions its own independent referees’ reports from people in the same field as the various nominees.
Today, the proportion of awards going to women is approaching parity with men. Yet no one is advocating for more class diversity. The lowest award, the OAM, typically goes to working-class people in local communities, but at the higher levels, networks of privilege can determine who receives the top honours. 
To be in the running for a top award you need four or five high-level referees, preferably with ACs themselves. How many people, even very accomplished ones, know five distinguished people willing to write a reference?
An analysis by Sydney Morning Herald journalists in 2021 revealed a quarter of the richest 200 people in Australia have awards. Directors of major corporations are strongly represented, and the recipients of the top awards, AOs and ACs, are heavily concentrated in the country’s wealthiest suburbs – 67 residents of Toorak had them, 57 in Mosman, 45 in South Yarra, 34 in Kew, and 39 in Vaucluse. The honours system, they concluded, “is arguably just as class-based as ever”.

We examined the educational backgrounds of the 63 people awarded Australia’s highest honour, the Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), over the four years 2019–22. Of those whose high schools could be identified, 34 (71%) attended private schools and 14 (29%) public schools. Of those who attended private schools, they were overwhelmingly elite ones (27 of the 34). It’s hard to avoid the conclusion that those born into privilege hog society’s highest symbols of esteem.
Has elite bias in the award of top honours improved or worsened in recent decades? We compared data from 2019–22, with the four-year period 1986–9 – that is, 33 years
earlier. In the earlier period, 64 ACs were awarded, compared with 63 in the later period.
The share going to private school graduates rose from 66% in the earlier period to 71% in the recent period, with the share going to graduates of expensive private schools rising from 47 to 56%. Public school graduates received 34% of ACs in 1986–9 and 29% in the recent period. On this evidence, class bias has become worse.
In the earlier period, 59 of the 64 ACs went to men and five to women; in the recent period, men received only 33 of the 63 awards and women 30. While we congratulate ourselves on greater gender diversity, the continuing domination of these most prestigious awards by wealthy elites goes unnoticed. 
Our privately schooled Rhodes scholars
We examined the schooling of Australian Rhodes scholars over the four decades 1983–2022. Data are systematically collected for three states only – Queensland, WA and Tasmania.  Given that exclusive private schools are more powerful in Sydney and Melbourne than elsewhere, we expect our results, if anything, to understate the bias.
The first observation to emerge from the data is increasing gender equality. In the first two decades, 1983–2004, 28% of recipients were women, while in the second two decades, 41% were women.
Over those decades, around 70% of all secondary students in the three states attended state schools but state school graduates received only 31% of Rhodes scholarships. 39% of Rhodes scholars attended high-fee private schools and 30% attended private schools with medium-low fees.
Comparing the two periods, 1983–2004 and 2005–22, the share of scholarships going to state school graduates fell from 36% to 27%. The share of scholarships going to students from the most exclusive schools, accounting for about 5% of all students, rose from 33% to 45%.
The dominance of elite private schools over the most prestigious academic awards has grown over the last 40 years. 
Graduates of elite private schools are around 20 times more likely to win Rhodes scholarships than those who went through the government system, even though their academic performance is no higher when account is taken of socioeconomic status. As we will see next, the same pattern emerges in appointments to Australia’s highest court.
The High Court: a decline in class diversity
In the legal world, “privilege” has more than one meaning. In 2021, a 20-year-old man found himself in court after he had punched a woman in the face because she had pushed back against his drunken insults in a pub (he had called her a “slut” and told her to “put her tits away”). 
Defending the man before the judge stood one of Sydney’s very best silks, Phillip Boulten SC, a former president of the NSW Bar Association and a barrister-of-choice for the city’s rich and powerful.
After hearing an account of the incident and the man’s admission of guilt for the assault, the judge decided to record no conviction. His honour’s judgement referred to the fact that the man had attended Knox Grammar, an elite school in Sydney’s leafy northern suburbs (Year 12 annual fee A$36,840 at the time of writing).

His reasoning was from start to finish exculpatory, suggesting the woman’s clothing “might have been perceived by a 20-year-old former student from Knox to be provocative” and that his action in punching the woman was “an aberration”. He wished the defendant good luck and advised him to “keep your nose clean, young man”.
In Britain, 65% of senior judges on the bench in 2019 had attended private schools. In the United States, Supreme Court judges come overwhelmingly from three Ivy League law schools, Yale, Columbia and Harvard, admission to which favours students from wealthy families. 
New data show that the same elite school bias prevails in Australia. Since the end of the second world war, 40 justices have been appointed to Australia’s highest court. If we divide them into two periods, each with 20 appointments, we see a welcome increase in diversity on the High Court bench. 
In the first period, 1946–87, all the justices were men; in the second period, 1987–2022, seven of the 20 appointments were women. However, this growing gender diversity conceals a decline in class diversity. 
In the earlier period, 60% of the High Court’s justices had been educated at private schools, with 45% at expensive private schools, bringing to the bench the worldview absorbed at those places. 
In the second period, 80% attended private schools, with fully 60% the products of the most privileged schools.
The last ten appointments since 2009 show no improvement. While five have been women, only three of the ten attended public schools, with seven the products of elite private institutions.
Although judges are required to make decisions without bias or prejudice, they are human beings. Today, when judges make comments or rulings that are explicitly sexist or racist, an uproar often follows, which isn’t to say that they do not make judgements that are implicitly sexist or racist. Similarly, and perhaps more insidiously, judges from privileged backgrounds may be prone to what has been called by a US chief judge “unselfconscious cultural elitism”.
Studies show that judges favour wealthy litigants over poor ones, in part because they may have “a fundamental misunderstanding of the lives of poor people.”
When asked whether the appointment of female judges makes a difference to judgements, Lady Hale, then president of the Supreme Court in the UK, said, “Where you start from can have an effect on where you end up,” which applies as much to class as it does to gender.

Parenting a perfectionist? Hereâs how you can respond,https://theconversation.com/parenting-a-perfectionist-heres-how-you-can-respond-224509,3011686,"Mental health, Stress, Parenting, Health, Perfectionism","
Some children show signs of perfectionism from early on. Young children might become frustrated and rip up their drawing if it’s not quite right. Older children might avoid or refuse to do homework because they’re afraid to make a mistake. 
Perfectionism can lead to children feeling overwhelmed, angry and frustrated, or sad and withdrawn. 
And yet perfectionism isn’t considered all bad in our society. Being called a “perfectionist” can be a compliment – code for being a great worker or student, someone who strives to do their best and makes sure all jobs are done well. 
These seemingly polarised views reflect the complex nature of perfectionism. 





What is perfectionism?
Researchers often separate perfectionism into two parts: 

perfectionistic strivings: being determined to meet goals and achieve highly
perfectionistic concerns: worry about being able to meet high standards, and self-criticism about performance. 

While perfectionistic strivings can be positive and lead to high achievement, perfectionistic concerns can lead to a higher chance of children developing eating disorders or anxiety and depression, and having lower academic achievement. 

Children and adolescents may experience perfectionism in relation to school work, sport, performance in art or music, or in relation to their own body. 
Signs of perfectionistic concerns in children and adolescents may include: 

children being highly critical of themselves
their reactions to mistakes seeming to be an overreaction
intense preoccupation and worry over their standards and goals and/or procrastination
significant change in performance, for example, lower academic results
irritability and negative emotions, stress and feelings of worthlessness
social problems with peers and friends, such as bullying and alienating themselves from peers.

A range of genetic, biological and environmental factors influence perfectionism in children. And as a parent, our role is important. While  research evidence suggests we can’t successfully increase positive perfectionistic strivings in our children, harsh or controlling parenting can increase negative perfectionistic concerns in children. 
Parents who are perfectionistic themselves can also model this to their children. 
So, how can we walk the line between supporting our child’s interests and helping them to achieve their potential, without pressuring them and increasing the risk of negative outcomes? 
Give them space to grow
A great metaphor is the gardener versus the carpenter described by psychology professor Alison Gopnik. 
Instead of trying to build and shape our children by controlling them and their environment (like a carpenter), parents can embrace the spirit of the gardener – providing lots of space for children to grow in their own direction, and nourishing them with love, respect and trust. 

We can’t control who they become, so it’s better to sit back, enjoy the ride, and look forward to watching the person they grow into.
However, there is still plenty we can do as parents if our child is showing signs of perfectionism. We can role model to our children how to set realistic goals and be flexible when things change or go wrong, help our children manage stress and negative emotions, and create healthy balance in our family daily routine. 
Set realistic goals
People with perfectionistic tendencies will often set unattainable goals. We can support the development of flexibility and realistic goal setting by asking curious questions, for example, “what would you need to do to get one small step closer to this goal?” Identifying upper and lower limits for goals is also helpful. 
If your child is fixed on a high score at school, for example, set that as the “upper limit” and then support them to identify a “lower limit” they would find acceptable, even if they are less happy with the outcome. 
This strategy may take time and practice to widen the gap between the two, but is useful to create flexibility over time. 
If a goal is performance-based and the outcome cannot be guaranteed (for example, a sporting competition), encourage your child to set a personal goal they have more control over.

We can also have conversations about perfectionism from early on, and explain that everyone makes mistakes. In fact, it’s great to model this to our children – talking about our own mistakes and feelings, to show them that we ourselves are not perfect. 
Talk aloud practices can help children to see that we “walk the walk”. For example, if you burn dinner you could reflect:

I’m disappointed because I put time and effort into that and it didn’t turn out as I expected. But we all make mistakes. I don’t get things right every time.

Manage stress and negative emotions
Some children and adolescents have a natural tendency towards perfectionism. Rather than trying to control their behaviour, we can provide gentle, loving support. 
When our child or adolescent becomes frustrated, angry, sad or overwhelmed, we support them best by helping them to name, express and validate all of their emotions. 
Parents may fear that acknowledging their child’s negative emotions will make the emotions worse, but the opposite is true.
Creating healthy balance
The building blocks of healthy child development are strong loving family relationships, good nutrition, creative play and plenty of physical activity, sleep and rest. 
Perfectionism is associated with rigidity, and thinking that there is only one correct way to succeed. We can instead encourage flexibility and creativity in children. 
Children’s brains grow through play. There is strong research evidence showing that creative, child-led play is associated with higher emotion regulation skills, and a range of cognitive skills, including problem-solving, memory, planning, flexibility and decision-making. 

Play isn’t just for young children either – there’s evidence that explorative, creative play of any kind also benefits adolescents and adults. 
There is also evidence that getting active outdoors in nature can promote children’s coping skills, emotion regulation and cognitive development.

"What is âNet Zeroâ, anyway? A short history of a monumental concept",https://theconversation.com/what-is-net-zero-anyway-a-short-history-of-a-monumental-concept-229901,3011685,"Climate change, Energy, Kyoto Protocol, Environment, Getting to Zero, Net zero emissions, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)","
Last month, the leaders of the G7 declared their commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest. Closer to home, the Albanese government recently introduced legislation to establish a Net Zero Economy Authority, promising it will catalyse investment in clean energy technologies in the push to reach net zero. 
Pledges to achieve net zero emissions over the coming decades have proliferated since the United Nation’s 2021 Glasgow climate summit, as governments declare their commitments to meeting the Paris Agreement goal of holding global warming under 1.5°C. But what exactly is “net zero”, and where did this concept come from? 

Stabilising greenhouse gases
In the early 1990s, scientists and governments were negotiating the key article of the UN’s 1992 climate change framework: “the stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic [human-caused] interference with the climate system”. How to achieve that stabilisation – let alone define “dangerous” climate change – has occupied climate scientists and negotiators ever since. 
From the outset, scientists and governments recognised reducing greenhouse gas emissions was only one side of the equation. Finding ways to compensate or offset emissions would also be necessary. 
The subsequent negotiation of the Kyoto Protocol backed the role of forests in the global carbon cycle as carbon sinks. 
It also provided the means for well-forested developing countries to participate in the emerging carbon offset market, and to play their part in reaching the carbon accounting goal of “carbon neutrality”. Under those terms, the industrialised countries subject to the Kyoto Protocol could pay developing countries to offset their own emissions as a form of low-cost mitigation. 
The Kyoto Protocol was unable to curtail soaring global greenhouse gas emissions, and a successor agreement appeared uncertain. As a result, interest turned in the late 2000s to the possibility of using highly controversial geoengineering techniques to remove greenhouse gas emissions. These proposals included sucking carbon dioxide out of the sky so the atmosphere would trap less heat, or reflecting sunlight away from the planet to reduce heat absorption. The focus on carbon sinks, whether through forests or direct air capture, would appear again in the idea of net zero. 
Temperature targets
By this point, policymakers and advocates were shifting away from emissions reductions goals (such as Australia’s unusual first Kyoto target to limit emissions to 108% of 1990 emissions by 2012). 
Instead, temperature targets became more popular, such as limiting warming to no more than two degrees above pre-industrial levels. The European Union had already adopted the 2°C threshold in 1996 and argued successfully for its relevance as a long-term objective for climate action.
What changed was scientists now had better ways of tracking how long carbon dioxide emissions would stay in the atmosphere, allowing better projections of our carbon budget. 
These findings allowed the IPCC’s 2014 report to clearly state limiting warming to below 2°C would require “near zero emissions of carbon dioxide and other long-lived greenhouse gases by the end of the century”. 

By this time, London-based environmental lawyer and climate negotiator Farhana Yamin had also set her sights on net zero by 2050. For Yamin, translating the 1.5°C ambition into climate negotiations meant focusing on net zero: “In your lifetime, emissions have to go to zero. That’s a message people understand.”
The concept of net zero offered a simple metric to assess mitigation efforts and hold parties legally accountable – an instrument she and colleagues proposed for the negotiation of a new legally binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. 
By late 2014, net zero had gained traction, appearing for the first time at a UN climate conference, the UN’s Emissions Gap Report, and in a speech by World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim that stressed “we must achieve zero net emissions of greenhouse gases before 2100”.
Zero in Paris
These efforts culminated in the 2015 Paris Agreement, which in addition to its well-known temperature targets of 1.5°C and 2°C, also added a complementary goal: 

To undertake rapid [emissions] reductions … so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removal by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century.

This is what “net zero” means – a “balance” between carbon emissions and carbon sinks. It was subsequently enshrined in the IPCC’s Special Report on the importance of keeping warming under 1.5°C, in which 195 member states agreed to get to net zero emissions by 2050. 
Slogan for greenwashing?
So, what’s next for net zero? Countries such as India have questioned what it means for fairness and equity between developing and developed nations, Instead, they favour the well-established approach of “common but differentiated responsibility” to mitigation. This justifies India’s aim to reach net zero emissions by 2070, as developed nations should lead the way and provide developing countries with funds and technologies necessary to support their mitigation ambitions.
The UN, by contrast, has warned the flexibility of net zero as a concept could make it a mere slogan for greenwashing by corporations and other non-state entities rather than a concrete objective. 
As the chair of the UN’s High Level Experts group put it: 

It’s not just advertising, bogus net-zero claims drive up the cost that ultimately everyone would pay. Including people not in this room, through huge impacts, climate migration and their very lives.

Given the chasm between pledges and practice documented in the 2023 UN Emissions Gap Report, there is a very real likelihood we will shoot past the temperature limits of the Paris Agreement. 

Fossil fuel treaty
Net zero isn’t the only approach to tackle climate change. Other concepts are growing in popularity. 
For instance, optimists say the temperature “overshoot” we’re on track for could be  tackled with a “drawdown” of carbon emissions if we use “carbon dioxide removal” or “negative emissions technologies” such as carbon capture and storage, soil carbon sequestration, and mass tree planting and reforestation. 
But beware: the IPCC’s Special Report cautioned that while some of these options might be technologically possible, they have not been tested on a large scale. 
Can these untested technologies be relied on to halt and reverse the chaos likely to be unleashed by dangerous levels of global heating? 
What does overshoot mean for the low-lying island nations who rallied around “1.5°C to stay alive”? 
Momentum has been building for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty since 2022, when Vanuatu called on the UN General Assembly to phase out the use of fossil fuels.
Such a treaty, Vanuatu President Nikenike Vurobaravu said, would “enable a global just transition for every worker, community and nation with fossil fuel dependence”.
At the Dubai climate conference late last year, held in the wake of the International Energy Agency’s revised Net Zero Roadmap, the negotiations culminated in a first for the UNFCCC – an explicit statement endorsing: 

transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems, in a just, orderly and equitable manner, accelerating action in this critical decade, so as to achieve net zero by 2050 in keeping with the science. 

Will net zero become more than hot air? That remains to be seen. While the science behind the concept is broadly sound, the politics of achieving net zero are a work in progress. 
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the point where they are zeroed out by carbon sinks by 2050 requires just and credible planning. We must prioritise the phase-out of fossil fuels sooner rather than later.

Businesses and directors could face multi-million dollar penalties if they fail to disclose their climate impact,https://theconversation.com/businesses-and-directors-could-face-multi-million-dollar-penalties-if-they-fail-to-disclose-their-climate-impact-229889,3011684,"Carbon emissions, Corporate accountability, Supply chains, COP26, Climate risk disclosure","
Large businesses will have to publicly disclose detailed information about what they are doing to reduce carbon emissions and other climate-related financial information under legislation before federal parliament.
Under the new legislation companies will have to include a separate sustainability report in their annual report.
And, as with the financial component of the annual report, the sustainability document will be formally adopted by the company’s board.
The UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow in 2021 (known as COP26) identified mandatory climate-related financial disclosure as necessary for combating climate change.





Disclosure makes a company’s climate-related risks, opportunities, metrics and targets transparent to its investors and other stakeholders.
The planned laws do not change what companies are required to do in response to climate change, but they allow regulators and stakeholders to monitor the company’s progress towards internationally agreed net-zero targets.
For that reason, the disclosures companies produce are likely to be closely scrutinised.   
What will the disclosure laws look like?
The specific – and lengthy – content requirements for the sustainability report are being developed by the Australian Accounting Standards Board in line with global sustainability reporting standards produced after COP26.

Companies will have to disclose information about their scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions.
Scope 1 emissions are those produced by a company’s own operations and scope 2 emissions are from the production of the energy it uses to do business. Scope 3 are the emissions produced by its supply chains, for example in the production of materials from suppliers or from the activities of businesses it funds.
To account for their scope 3 emissions, companies preparing sustainability reports will need detailed information from the businesses with which they deal.
Australia already has a regime – known as the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme – that requires companies with a big climate impact to report their emissions, energy production and energy consumption to the government each year.
The new sustainability reporting requirement is wider than this, and will apply much more broadly.
Which businesses will be affected?
When the new laws are fully implemented, they will apply to all companies covered by the existing NGER scheme, all investment trusts and funds (including superannuation funds) with assets over A$5 billion, and other companies that meet two out of three proposed size thresholds. The proposed thresholds are: assets above $25 million, revenue above $50 million and 100 or more employees. 
For now, the sustainability report will focus on climate-related issues. But the legislation flags the possibility of adding other environmental disclosures (for example, covering nature and biodiversity impacts) in later years.
In first few years, the disclosure laws will be enforced by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) only, and private plaintiffs including climate advocates will be locked out of courts.
If the company’s disclosure is misleading, and ASIC can demonstrate the company didn’t take all reasonable steps to ensure it was accurate, the company can face civil penalties.  These, for very large companies, can run to hundreds of millions of dollars.

Statements about the future will be taken to be misleading unless the company can demonstrate reasonable grounds for making them. 
Once the transition arrangements expire, companies can also expect shareholders and climate advocates to be active in the courts to punish misleading disclosure.
New pressure on company directors
Making the sustainability report a component of the annual report – rather than a separate document – has important legal consequences for company directors.
For the first few years of the new reporting regime, the directors will have to declare whether, in their opinion, the company has taken reasonable steps to ensure the sustainability report accords with the law.
After that, they will be required to declare whether, in their opinion, the report complies with the sustainability reporting standards set by the Australian Accounting Standards Board and accurately includes all required disclosures.
Directors have a statutory duty to ensure the company meets the legal requirements for annual reporting, a duty that will extend to the sustainability report.
Also, the laws that make directors personally liable for defects in mandatory corporate disclosure documents will apply.
These provisions, which can be enforced by ASIC, carry a maximum civil penalty for individuals of $1,565,000. 
Will the new disclosure laws change sustainability governance?
For many decades, board members have been expected to take personal responsibility for what their company says in its financial report.
They cannot simply leave it to the management team or the auditors to ensure the disclosure is accurate. As a result, the financial information is carefully reviewed and directors ask detailed questions about the data and assumptions on which it based.
The financial report provides stakeholders with a clear picture of the company’s financial viability and performance. But it also forces the board to pay close attention these issues.
Under the new laws directors will have personal responsibility for what the company says in the sustainability report. Designing the law this way will force directors to pay the same close attention to the company’s climate-related disclosures.
They will need to understand and question the data and assumptions that underpin the disclosure. 
This will affect the company’s broader governance, by elevating sustainability issues in boardroom discussions and bringing climate-related risks, opportunities, targets and metrics closer to the centre of boardroom deliberations.
It should make directors much more aware of – and sensitive to – their company’s climate impact.

A rare find in ancient Timorese mud may rewrite the history of human settlement in Australasia,https://theconversation.com/a-rare-find-in-ancient-timorese-mud-may-rewrite-the-history-of-human-settlement-in-australasia-228391,3011683,"Archaeology, Human migration, Australasia, Caves, Timor, Sahul, New research, Australia New Zealand","
Humans arrived in Australia at least 65,000 years ago, according to archaeological evidence. These pioneers were part of an early wave of people travelling eastwards from Africa, through Eurasia, and ultimately into Australia and New Guinea.
But this was only one of many waves of migration in the story of the human colonisation of the globe. These waves were probably driven by climate change and the ability of groups to adapt to a wide range of environments.
In new research published in Nature Communications, we have found evidence that a large wave of migration reached the island of Timor not long after 50,000 years ago. Our work at Laili rock shelter suggests the people who first reached Australia some 65,000 years ago came via New Guinea, while Timor and other southern islands were only colonised by a later wave of settlers.

Potential routes to Australia
Timor has long been regarded as a potential stepping-stone island for the first human migration between mainland Southeast Asia and Australia and New Guinea. At the time of these ancient migrations, sea levels were lower, so many of what are now islands in Southeast Asia were joined to the mainland in a region known as Sunda, and Australia and New Guinea were joined together in a single continent known as Sahul.





The islands between Sunda to the west and Sahul to the east are known as Wallacaea. These islands have never been connected to each other or the mainland, owing to the deep channels that separate them. This has meant that even when sea levels were much lower than today they remained as islands.

The search for evidence of early migrations on Timor has been hampered by a lack of suitable sediments in caves and rock shelters. 
However, we found a unique source of evidence at Laili rock shelter, overlooking the Laleia river in central-north Timor-Leste. Unlike other sites in the region, Laili preserved deep sediments dating between 59,000 and 54,000 years ago which contained no sign of human presence.

On top of these layers we found clear signs of human arrival, in the dirt occurring about 44,000 years ago. This provides clear evidence that while humans were initially absent from the site and the local landscape, they subsequently arrived in what must have been significant numbers.
From other research, we also know there is evidence of humans arriving at other sites in Timor-Leste and nearby Flores Island between 47,000 and 45,000 years ago. Taken together, all this evidence strongly supports the view that humans only arrived in this region around this time.
Evidence in the dirt
Our analysis of the sediment layers at Laili suggests humans arrived in a deliberate and large-scale colonisation effort, rather than ad-hoc settlement by a small population. This is clearly seen in the earliest traces of occupation, which include hearths, dense accumulations of stone artefacts, and the remains of a diet rich in fish and shellfish.
We used a technique called micromorphology to study the layers of sediment under the microscope. 
We could see the sediment from before the time of occupation did not carry signs of human presence. But when humans moved in to the site, many traces of human occupation appeared abruptly, including compressed trampled layers caused by the passage of people on the shelter floor.
Island hopping to Sahul
Our findings may prompt a re-evaluation of the route and timing of the earliest human migration into Sahul. They also show movement to the islands was an ongoing process rather than a single event, with occupation of the southern islands occurring thousands of years after the initial settlement of Australia. 
The intensity of the initial occupation we found at Laili suggests this migration may have been large enough to overwhelm previous migrations in the islands of Southeast Asia and Australasia. 
The earlier dispersal waves, including the people using the ancient Madjebebe rock shelter in Australia, may have been small numbers of people coming from a different route further north via New Guinea. The later wave of dispersal through the Wallacean Islands may have formed a much more significant arrival of humans on Sahul.
The absence of human occupation on Timor before 50,000 years ago indicates that humans arrived on the island later than previously supposed. This supports the theory that humans first arrived in Australia via New Guinea rather than Timor. 
This path is less direct, but it may be explained by the fact the southern islands including Timor have far fewer land-dwelling animals to eat. Early colonists would have needed the flexibility to live on fish and shellfish. So moving into these southern islands could have been more challenging than the northern islands which had more medium to large land animals.

UK election called for 4 July ,https://theconversation.com/uk-election-called-for-4-july-what-happens-next-230732,3011587,"UK politics, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","
On a rainy afternoon in London, an increasingly damp Rishi Sunak confirmed what many had been speculating for most of the day in a speech outside 10 Downing Street – that the UK is heading for an election earlier than anticipated. Here’s what to expect in the weeks ahead. 
When is the UK having an election?
Election day has been confirmed for 4 July – in just over six weeks’ time. 
The UK has to have an election at least every five years but elections can be called at any time within that timeframe. Sunak had to hold a vote before the end of January 2025 but, until this surprise announcement, the country had largely expected an autumn date. 
Sunak always said the vote would be in the second half of the year (which July technically is). But it still came as a shock that the vote has been called so early. Many of his own MPs are said to be annoyed at the prospect.





Why is Sunak calling the election now?
Sunak’s speech rested on the argument that only he and the Conservative party can lead Britain through the “most challenging” time since the end of the second world war. This is a dangerous argument, as Labour will point to the fact that many of the underlying problems, such as the state of public services and the economic turmoil caused by Liz Truss’s mini budget, have been created under (and even by) the Conservative government.

Sunak set the date as soon as it was confirmed that inflation is easing, which is a much needed piece of good news for his government. He may also have planned to surprise Labour, having learned that the opposition was allowing staff to take holidays over the summer, thinking there would not be an election until after the summer recess. 
Is the campaign always so short?
“Short campaigns” – the period between the day the election is called and election day itself, are very short in the UK compared to many other countries. They last a minimum of 25 working days and are rarely much longer. 
The long campaign, however, is the period of time when parties have a sense that an election is imminent. Given that Sunak was working towards the end of the five-year deadline, the long campaign has been running for some time. All of the UK’s political parties have been preparing and they will, or at least should be, largely campaign-ready, even if this all feels sudden to the rest of us. 
What was the song playing as Sunak announced the date?
Sunak’s speech was at times almost entirely drowned out by a protester playing very loud music at the gates of Downing Street. This was D:Ream’s Things Can Only Get Better – a song which British people associate with Tony Blair’s campaign in 1997, when Labour won by a landslide. 

What happens next?
Sunak has already spoken to king Charles to ask for permission to dissolve parliament. This will happen on May 30. After that point, technically, there are no MPs (all incumbents who decide to stand become candidates, rather than MPs). Any parliamentary business that has not been completed before that day will be scrapped. 
MPs will then start campaigning across the UK’s 650 constituencies, hoping to win a parliamentary seat. This traditionally includes door-to-door canvassing. Some will also feature in the national campaign, especially those who are also government ministers. Party leaders will engage in the national campaign and dip in and out of local campaigns when it is opportune for them to do so – such as in key battleground areas. TV debates have been a feature of British politics since 2010 and the broadcasters will now be negotiating how many of those will take place, who will be included and when they should be aired. 
Will there be a change of government?
While the last few years has taught us all to never say never in British politics, polls give the Labour party a commanding lead over the incumbent Conservative party, pointing to a change of government.
In this scenario, Labour leader Starmer would become prime minister. Any other result would be presented as a major polling failure. 
The Conservative government has been in power since 2010, though this also includes a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats between 2010 and 2015. David Cameron then led a Conservative government without the Liberal Democrats between 2015 and 2016, when he resigned in the wake of the Brexit vote. 
Since then, the UK has had four prime ministers – Theresa May (2016-2019), Boris Johnson (2019-2022), Truss (for 49 days in 2022) and Sunak (since October 2022). Sunak will attempt to argue that this makes him still relatively “new”, all the while emphasising that he warned that Truss’s tax plans were a mistake.
Do all parts of the UK vote?
Yes – voters in England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales will vote in the UK election. Although there are devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (and major urban areas of England) each of these areas, along with the rest of England, also elect MPs to sit in the Westminster parliament. 

However, Labour does not stand candidates in Northern Ireland and if any Sinn Féin candidates win seats in Northern Ireland, they traditionally do not take their seats in Westminster.
When would a new prime minister be installed?
When an election result is a clear majority, the leader of the winning party starts as prime minister immediately after the result is confirmed – so there is no transition period, as in the case of the US for example. If there is a change of prime minister, the incumbent must leave Downing Street immediately and their replacement will arrive soon after. British politics is brutal in this respect. 
Technically the prime minister is appointed by the monarch, so the election winner’s first act is to visit the king.
However, this assumes the result is clear. In 2010, when no party won a majority of seats, Gordon Brown remained prime minister for five days after the election while trying (and ultimately failing) to broker a coalition agreement.
Why do some people think this is all about football?
Holding an election on 4 July puts the vote right in the middle of the UEFA European football championships, leading some to speculate that Sunak is hoping to capitalise on a positive national mood to turn his fortunes around. Whether that is a realistic hope will become apparent sooner rather than later, but Sunak must know it is a gamble. The last time a general election was called during an international football tournament was in 1970. Harold Wilson’s Labour lost four days after the reigning champions, England, were beaten by West Germany in the World Cup quarter-finals.

Doctors engage the public by bringing a human side to social media,https://theconversation.com/doctors-engage-the-public-by-bringing-a-human-side-to-social-media-227732,3011451,"Social media, Doctors, Health communication, Health-care workers, Doctor-patient relationship, Doctor-patient communication, X (formerly Twitter)","
A few years ago, doctors flooded social media with photos of themselves in swimsuits, along with the hashtag #medbikini. The reason?  A recently published study suggested it was “unprofessional” for women physicians to post photos of themselves in bikinis.  
Although the study caused a major outcry and was eventually retracted, its key message was nothing new. For decades, doctors have been trained to keep their personal lives separate from their work lives. To maintain their identities as trusted experts wherever they go — even on the beach. 
Studies have shown that this pressure to appear professional can lead to burnout and even suicide. It may also damage physicians’ relationship with the public, because people tend to trust experts who are not only knowledgeable, but also warm and personable. 

But our new study shows that — despite these pressures — physicians feel it’s important to show their personal side on social media. To be effective health communicators, they see that presenting their “human self” as well as their “professional self” allows them to role model healthy behaviours for peers and trainees, and to be more relatable to their patients and the public.  





Doctors on X
As researchers who study health communication and physician education, we wanted to understand how doctors present themselves on social media — an environment where the lines between personal and professional are often blurred. 
We interviewed 28 doctors in the United States about how they decide when and what to post and who they hope to reach on X (formerly Twitter). We also looked at each doctor’s bio and profile photo, noting the images, hashtags and descriptions they used to present themselves. 
We found that the doctors used X for many reasons, ranging from the strictly professional to the highly personal. They used the platform to connect with colleagues, advocate for social change, raise awareness about social justice issues and educate the public about health topics, which aligns with previous research.
This public outreach wasn’t just a hobby or passion for physicians, but a core part of their professional role. As one doctor put it: “I feel like it’s part of my job. It’s part of what I signed up for as being a physician to educate my communities.” 
Most importantly, doctors also used X to show a more human side, posting about their families, pets, vacations (yes, including pictures of themselves in swimsuits), hobbies and more. Many were also upfront about their failures and struggles with their mental health, explaining that they wanted to show the general public (but also remind some of their medical colleagues) that doctors “are human beings…like everyone else.” 
Doctors felt it was important that their posts and profile represented their authentic self and not just their professional credentials, although they showcased those as well. As one doctor put it: “This is me. I’m a physician. I’m a woman. I’m a mother.”
Showing their authentic selves

Doctors explained that showing their human side wasn’t just something they did for themselves but was also a way to build trusting relationships with their patients. They were keenly aware that trust is essential for effective medical care, increasing the chances that patients will return for follow-up visits and stick to health recommendations. 
As one doctor put it, “I think I get credibility for demonstrating humanity, honestly…Once they sort of know who I am as a human, I like to think that it, I hope, makes them more likely to listen when I say something medically.” 
Doctors also shared their authentic selves to create social change, both in their profession and in society at large. Recognizing the high levels of stress students face in medical school, they hoped to role model for future physicians that “doctors can’t be doctors all of the time” and encourage them to work towards better work-life balance. Doctors also used their profiles to speak out about important social justice issues, such as diversity in medicine, gun control and the climate crisis. 
At times, doctors’ openness about their personal identities and beliefs caused tensions in their professional lives. For example, some received comments from employers who felt their social media use was “too personal.” Others experienced harassment, including offensive comments about their race or gender. 
Still, the doctors in our study overwhelmingly felt that showing this human side was worth it — that it made them better social media communicators, doctors and citizens. By showing their authentic selves online, they felt they could show colleagues, aspiring doctors and the public that it is possible — and even beneficial — to be both a doctor and a human being.

"Norway, Ireland, Spain recognise Palestinian statehood: what this means for Middle East peace ",https://theconversation.com/norway-ireland-spain-recognise-palestinian-statehood-what-this-means-for-middle-east-peace-expert-qanda-230729,3011298,"Israel, United Nations, Gaza, Hamas, West Bank, Benjamin Netanyahu, Palestinian Authority, Occupied Palestinian Territory, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Palestinian statehood","
Norway, Ireland and Spain have all announced plans to recognise the state of Palestine on May 28. The move has drawn harsh criticism from Israel, which has withdrawn its ambassadors from the three countries. 
Jonas Gahr Støre, the Norwegian prime minister, said: “There cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.”
Simon Harris, the Irish prime minister, said: “Just as Ireland’s recognition as a state eventually led to the establishment of our now peaceful republic, we believe that Palestinian statehood will contribute to peace and to reconciliation in the Middle East.”
We spoke with Simon Mabon, a professor of international politics at the Lancaster University who has spent many years observing the political dynamics of the Middle East, to unravel the likely ramifications of this latest development.





As of the beginning of May this year, 143 countries already recognised Palestine as an independent state. They voted to admit Palestine to the United Nations (where it presently has observer status). So how important are these declarations from Norway, Ireland and Spain?
The decision to recognise Palestine as a state is a hugely significant and symbolic step, particularly when taken by western states. The decision highlights the growing support for Palestinian self-determination across much of the world – and the decisions have been welcomed by the Arab League. And yet, recognition by these states alone is not enough.
Prominent western powers – including the US, UK, France and Germany – have thus far refrained from recognising Palestine on the basis that it would “undermine” the moribund Oslo peace process. The Oslo accords articulated a vision of peaceful co-existence between two states – the so-called “two state solution” – yet the absence of an internationally recognised sovereign state of Palestine undermines this whole approach.
The US and UK remain hold-outs on this. To what extent have the positions of the UK and other western European states been influence by Washington’s steadfast support for Israel?
For much of the past century, states across the west have largely been reluctant to diverge from US positions on particular issues, with Washington support for Israel central in much of this. Moving away from America’s explicitly pro-Israel stance would have provoked much ire in the Washington beltway, creating friction in diplomatic relations with the dominant global power. 
And yet, over the past year, officials from the UK, US and other EU member states have indicated some degree of support for the establishment of a Palestinian state. The devastation of Gaza has pushed this forward, demonstrating the need for a breakthrough and moves towards a lasting peace.
The US is reportedly exploring the possibility of recognising Palestine as part of a “grand bargain” that involves an end to the war in Gaza and Saudi Arabia’s recognition of the state of Israel. Yet Saudi officials have made it clear that recognition of Israel can only occur after the war in Gaza is ended and an “independent Palestinian state is recognised on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital”. 
Other states across the Middle East have tied the post-conflict reconstruction of Gaza to Palestinian statehood. All the while, Israeli officials – must notably Benjamin Netanyahu – have vocally condemned these moves, with Israel’s ambassadors to Norway, Spain and Ireland immediately recalled.
The establishment of Palestine as an independent state is a key precursor to a two-state solution. Looking at a map of the region as it stands now, it seems almost impossible to imagine. What’s the best option for determining the borders of the two redesigned nations?
If one looks at the Palestinian pages of the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office website, their title is the “Occupied Palestinian Territories”. This stems from the fallout of the 1967 war – known as the six-day war – where Israeli forces occupied the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, the Sinai peninsula, and most of the Golan Heights. The capture of these territories was not recognised by the international community. Most continue to recognise East Jerusalem and the West Bank as occupied.
On recognising a Palestinian state, Ireland’s foreign minister, Michael Martin, declared that this entity would be based on its 1967 borders, meaning that the Palestinian state includes Gaza, the West Bank, and Jerusalem existing as the capital of both an Israeli and Palestinian state. The practicalities of this, however, are far more complex, stemming from the presence of illegal settlements across the West Bank, and broader questions of security.
The Oslo II accord established administrative divisions across the West Bank ahead of a final status agreement. Area A, of 18% of the territory, is administered by the Palestinian Authority under Palestinian police control. Area B, of 22% of the territory, is administered by the Palestinian Authority with security control shared with Israel. Area C, by far the largest at 60%, is solely administered by Israel and is home to an estimated 300,000 Palestinians and 400,000 Israeli settlers. This poses further challenges to reaching a final status agreement.

The rising influence of the religious right in Israel further complicates matters. Members of the religious right have gained prominence in the Knesset [parliament], while associated settler moments continue to capture land across Area C and violently abuse indigenous Palestinians across the West Bank and in East Jerusalem. Reaching a final status agreement necessitates addressing these challenges, along with the existential issue of the claims over Jerusalem.
Israel’s core position, and one that is supported by the US, is that it must have guaranteed security. But an independent Palestinian state will presumably manage its own security as well as an independent foreign policy. So what if the newly independent Palestine seeks to ally itself closely with powers that are openly hostile towards Israel and the west, including Iran and Russia?
Questions about security have plagued efforts to reach a final status agreement. For Israelis, their broad engagement with the Palestinian territories have been driven by security issues, including the blockade of Gaza and the “separation barrier” and checkpoints across the West Bank. 
Continuing to exercise security oversight over the West Bank has been central to Israel’s stance and engagement with areas B and C. The establishment of a Palestinian state would, by definition, remove Israel’s security oversight. This is because the new Palestinian state would necessarily be sovereign and, by definition, require that others adhere to the principle of non-interference in its affairs. This potentially poses a significant challenge to Israel’s security calculations. Members of the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) regularly enter the West Bank and Gaza to “mow the lawn”, a strategic process of targeted killings.
A new Palestinian state would not be short of allies, across the Arab world and beyond. Sovereign states are by definition free to establish independent foreign policies and to ally with whoever they may choose. 
We know that Hamas has received support from Iran, itself vocal in its hostility to Israel, but the nature of this support differs from Tehran’s engagement with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Popular Mobilisation Units in Iraq, or the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Following the recent spate of attacks that took place between Israel and Iran, any alliance between a Palestinian state and Iran would be seen as a serious security challenge by policymakers across Israel. 
The stakes are high – but the situation looks increasingly desperate from all sides. With a devastatingly high death toll and the devastation of life across Gaza as well as the continued occupation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank and with a final status agreement increasingly unlikely, something must change.

A hotter world is likely to be a sicker world.
Earth’s growing fever has obvious repercussions for human health, like heatwaves that are hotter than our physiology can tolerate. Humanity’s departure from the stable climate it inherited will yield surprises, too, though. Some of those may be existing diseases appearing in new places or spreading with greater ferocity. And some, experts fear, may be new diseases entirely.

The mosquito-borne infection malaria killed more than half a million people each year during the last decade. Most of these victims were children and almost all (95% in 2022) were in Africa.





As a source of disease, infectious mosquitoes are at least predictable in their need for three things: warm temperatures, humid air and puddles to breed in. So what difference will global heating make?
Parasites are on the march
“The relationship between climate and malaria transmission is complex and has been the subject of intense study for some three decades,” say water and health experts Mark Smith (University of Leeds) and Chris Thomas (University of Lincoln).

      Mapping malaria in Africa: climate change study predicts where mosquitoes will breed in future




Much of this research has focused on sub-Saharan Africa, the global epicentre of malaria cases and deaths. Smith and Thomas combined temperature and water movement projections to produce a continent-wide analysis of malaria risk.
Their results showed that the conditions for malaria transmission will become less suitable overall, especially in west Africa. But where temperature and humidity are likely to suit infectious mosquitoes in future also happens to be where lots more people are expected to live, near rivers like the Nile in Egypt.

“This means the number of people living in potentially malaria endemic areas (suitable for transmission more than nine months a year) will increase by 2100 to over a billion,” they say.
Elsewhere, tropical diseases will slip their bonds as the insects carrying them survive further from the equator. This is already happening in France, where dengue fever cases spiked during the hot summer of 2022.
“It seems that the lowlands of Veneto [in Italy] are emerging as an ideal habitat for the Culex mosquitoes, which can host and transmit West Nile virus,” adds Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton.

      Dengue in France: tropical diseases in Europe may not be that rare for much longer




Research suggests that the global transmission of mosquito-borne diseases like malaria and dengue will change, says Mark Booth, a senior lecturer in parasite epidemiology at Newcastle University. That’s as clear a picture as Booth could conjure from modelling more than 20 tropical diseases in a warming world.
“For most other parasites, there was little or no evidence. We simply don’t know what to expect,” he says.

      Why climate change is making parasitic diseases harder to predict




Some diseases will bring fresh torment for the species humans farm. Bluetongue, a virus transmitted by midges, is expected to infect sheep further afield – in central Africa, western Russia and the US – than subtropical Asia and Africa where it evolved, Booth says.
And the prognoses for some diseases afflicting humans will worsen. UCL academics Sanjay Sisodiya, a neuroscientist and Mark Maslin, an earth system scientist, found that climate change is exacerbating the symptoms of certain brain conditions.

      Climate change is linked to worsening brain diseases – new study




“Each of the billions of neurons in our brain is like a learning, adapting computer, with many electrically active components,” they say. “Many of these components work at a different rate depending on the ambient temperature, and are designed to work together within a narrow range of temperatures.”
A species that evolved in Africa, humans are comfortable between 20˚C and 26˚C and within 20% and 80% humidity, Sisodiya and Maslin say. Our brain is already working close to the limit of its preferred temperature range in most cases, so even small increases matter.
“When those environmental conditions move rapidly into unaccustomed ranges, as is happening with extreme temperatures and humidity related to climate change, our brain struggles to regulate our temperature and begins to malfunction.”

One planet, one health
Clearly, staying healthy isn’t as simple as regulating what you eat or how often you exercise. There is a lot that is beyond your immediate control.
“Within less than three years, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared two public health emergencies of international concern: COVID-19 in February 2020 and monkeypox in July 2022,” says Arindam Basu, an associate professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the University of Canterbury.
“At the same time, extreme weather events are being reported continuously across the world and are expected to become more frequent and intense. These are not separate issues.”
Basu highlights the danger of new diseases emerging, particularly from pathogens that could jump between humans and animals as habitats change amid global heating.

“Close contact between humans and wild animals is increasing as forests are destroyed to make way for agriculture and trade in exotic animals continues,” he says. “At the same time, the thawing of permafrost is releasing microbes hidden beneath the ice.”
Since pathogens share the same ecosystems as the humans and animals they infect, a new conception of health is urgently needed. This should aim to optimise the health of people, wildlife and the environment, Basu says.
Diseases. Again, the climate crisis exposes our countless connections to everything else – and our shared frailty on the only planet known to harbour life.
