    "content": "Prince Harry is set to make a bombshell appearance in a new ITV documentary about phone hacking amid his ongoing court case.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex, 39, will open up about his experiences and mission to expose the actions of the UK’s tabloid press.\n\nThe issue is of huge significance for Harry, who cited press intrusion as one of the reasons he stepped down as a working royal in 2020.\n\nNews of the documentary Tabloids on Trial comes amid the ongoing backlash against the Duke for his receipt of the Pat Tillman Award today.\n\nHarry will receive the award for veterans in honour of his work with the Invictus Games at a glittering ceremony in Los Angeles.\n\nESPN’s decision to give him the award has not been without controversy in the US, and tens of thousands of people have signed a Change.org petition arguing there are more deserving recipients.\n\nThe late Mr Tillman’s mum, Mary, said she cannot understand why the award is being given to such a “controversial and divisive” individual.
