A theory that can help explain why we respond poorly to modern conditions, despite the choices, safety and other benefits they bring, is evolutionary mismatch.\nMismatch happens when an evolved adaptation, either physical or psychological, becomes misaligned with the environment. Take moths and some species of nocturnal flies, for example. Because they have to navigate in the dark, they evolved to use the moon for direction. But due to the invention of artificial lighting, many moths and flies are drawn to street lamps and indoor lights instead.\nThe same happens for humans. A classic example is our \u201csweet tooth\u201d, which motivated ancestral humans to search for calorie-rich foods in nutritionally scarce environments. This sweet tooth becomes mismatched to the modern world when food companies mass produce foods laden with refined sugars and fat, hijacking an otherwise useful trait. The result is tooth decay, obesity and diabetes. \nThe modern world is replete with things that make our once-adaptive instincts go awry. For instance, humans evolved to live in kin-based, nomadic tribes of approximately 50 to 150 close-knit people. Our adaptive need to belong functions well in such settings. In large cities populated by hundreds of thousands of strangers, however, people can end up feeling lonely and like they have not many close friends.\n\n\n\n\n\nStudies have also shown that when social animals are kept in crowded spaces, they experience competitive stress which has consequences for physical health such as poorer immune functioning and reduced fertility. Like the animals in the crowding studies, humans living in crowded cities too can experience unprecedented levels of stress and tend to have fewer children.\n\nThe social inequality in modern societies also differs from the more egalitarian hunter-gatherer environment. Humans evolved to care about social status, which motivates us to redress status gaps between ourselves and others. But when social disparity is too intense and people like Elon Musk, whose net worth would take the average American several million years of work at the mean annual wage to catch up with, are regularly made salient by the media, our concerns with social status can lead to social status anxiety. \nSocial media exacerbates the problems associated with social comparisons. As people typically share the best sides of themselves online, social media presents a skewed impression of reality, which can make viewers feel worse about their own. The quantification of worth through likes and followers also allows people to obsess with greater precision over where they stand in relation to others.\nSeveral problematic trends can be understood from this evolutionary mismatch. For instance, competition and status anxiety have been linked to obsessions with educational attainment, vying for prestigious jobs and materialism. There is a growing trend of \u201cgoing broke to look rich\u201d, as people incur debt to afford things that create the impression of having status. \nPeople are also more likely to take risks when they feel that they need to gain a competitive edge. Coupled with the rising cost of living, people can find their jobs are inadequate not only to keep up with societal expectations but also to build wealth. A 2023 report by global investment professionals association, the CFA Institute, indicated that many Gen Z people are turning to risky investments like cryptocurrencies in a bid to cope. The intensely competitive modern world can also drive people to undergo dangerous cosmetic surgeries and weight loss regimes.\nAs people struggle to live up to society\u2019s expectations of successful adults, they seem to be redefining their goals in life. Surveys of Gen Z and Millennial respondents have found that increasing costs of living are forcing these age groups to lower their career ambitions and give up the idea of owning a home, starting a family or even finding a romantic partner. A 2023 survey of 55,000 people born between 1981 and 2012 found that respondents are focusing on caring more for their mental and physical health instead. \nWhen competition becomes too intense, people may internalise the pressure and experience anxiety or depression. Researchers have linked self-harm and depression to people feeling they can no longer deal with the demands of modern society. These trends are especially prevalent in countries with a strong shame culture, such as Japan and South Korea.\nStudies have shown that some externalising responses may include anger at the perceived unfairness of a contest that seems impossible to win, resulting in cynicism, aggression and hostility. A manifestation of this anger can be noted in, for example, \u201cincel\u201d circles, in which men often feel they are unable to find a romantic or sexual partner because the odds are unjustly stacked against them.\nWhat can we do\nThe evolutionary mismatch perspective doesn\u2019t suggest that we return completely to an ancestral way of life, but to find ways to adjust our environment such that it aligns better with our evolved nature. For example, we can think of ways to engineer the built environment to reduce crowdedness or increase access to nature. Indeed, nature immersion, such as forest-bathing (focusing on sensory engagement to connect with nature) and community gardening, can reduce stress and improve wellbeing.\nLifestyle changes to reduce consumerism and exposure to mass and social media, alongside focusing on meaningful work rather than job prestige, are also likely to help. Some counter-trends like minimalism and mindfulness indicate a growing awareness that finding contentment in the little things can allow us to avoid the pitfalls of modernity. \nThese are just some ideas. But appreciating the evolutionary basis of our problems and raising awareness of the mismatch perspective may give us a better chance of tackling them at the root.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Evolution, Mental health, Wellbeing, Technology, Self-harm, Social status, Hunter-gatherer, Incel, Incels, nomads, Incel culture, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

In my research and teaching, I have seen that students in fact want to have difficult conversations across divides, but they need support from faculty and other facilitators in order for these discussions to go well. \nSince early 2017, I have been observing events on college campuses in which students are brought together with peers with whom they disagree to talk about politics. In these sessions, facilitators provide students with guiding questions that help them to understand their peers\u2019 political views. \nI conducted follow-up interviews with students a few weeks afterward and, when possible, three years later.\nMy aim is to understand what happens in these conversations. I want to know: Who learns what from whom? Who feels satisfied or frustrated, and why? And what does this all portend for America\u2019s democracy?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conversations I observed have taught me that six practices help to support a better experience for all students.\n1. Set norms and expectations\nWhen people talk about setting norms for conversation, they usually assume it is an effort to mandate speech rules. But norm-setting accomplishes something better than rule-following: It allows students to become sensitive to their own and others\u2019 hopes and fears for the conversation. \nIn my experience, opening the session with questions such as \u201cWhat do you most hope will happen in this conversation?\u201d \u201cWhat worries you most about the conversation?\u201d \u201cWhat are you willing to give to it?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you hope to get from it?\u201d can show students that they already share more than they anticipate. \nMoreover, this discussion leads naturally into the question of \u201cHow can we interact in a way that is most likely to realize our aims?\u201d Students typically volunteer their own guidelines, such as assuming good faith, objecting to a person\u2019s idea rather than attacking the person, honestly conveying when and why they feel hurt, and listening generously.\n2. Allow students to tell their personal stories\nBeginning with students\u2019 personal stories lowers the barriers to entry, so that students who are not experts on politics can contribute. It allows students to feel heard about their direct experience. And it allows for what I have found to be the most profound outcome of dialogue: the shifts in how students feel about each other.  \nFor example, consider the \u201cCan We Talk\u201d campus dialogue series, which brings together ideologically diverse students for two-hour sessions in which facilitators provide a series of questions for students to ask each other. The sessions began with questions such as, \u201cHow were politics discussed in the home in which you were raised?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your earliest political memory?\u201d before moving on to questions about students\u2019 substantive views on relevant issues.\nThe focus of these sessions, which I observed in the 2017-2018 academic year at colleges throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is on cultivating students\u2019 understanding of each other\u2019s views and how they came to be.\n\nIf the dialogue is intended to focus on a specific issue, such as gun control, abortion or the war in Israel and Gaza, questions can be geared accordingly, such as \u201cWhen did you first learn about this issue?\u201d \u201cHow did it affect you at the time?\u201d or \u201cWhat about this issue draws you to this conversation?\u201d \n3. Encourage curiosity\nStudents are often afraid that they will end up validating views they oppose unless they try to discredit those views. But in follow-up interviews I conducted three years after  their participation in a dialogue session,  I found that those students who did eventually change their political views were prompted to do so through sincere and nonthreatening questions. \u201cI remember one girl asked me, \u2018If you say you believe this, then why did you vote like that?\u2019 I\u2019ve been asking myself that question ever since,\u201d admitted one student, whose politics changed considerably in the years between our first and second interviews. It mattered most that she felt questioned, not attacked. \nQuestions can be encouraged throughout a conversation by reserving specific time for them in each round, as well as through directions such as \u201cThink of one question you have always wanted to ask someone who thinks differently than you about this issue. Ask it now.\u201d \n4. Dig into disagreement\nOne risk of emphasizing personal experience at the start is that students hesitate to dig into their disagreements. They want to be supportive, and it\u2019s hard to argue with personal experience. In my research, though, I found that students ended up with the deepest respect for each other when they gained understanding of the nature of their disagreements.\nClarifying what is at stake in their differences allowed students to see that their opposition was not caused by ignorance, malice or madness on the other side, but legitimate contrasts in views of what is good and possible. \nAfter students have shared their views on issues and asked each other curiosity-oriented questions, they can be directed to ask each other questions such as \u201cWhat is at the root of our disagreement?\u201d and \u201cWhat really matters to me, and to you, and is it the same thing? To the extent that it is not, why not?\u201d \n\n5. Collaborate on next steps\nStudents tend to feel most satisfied when they can work toward a more concrete aim. Most ambitiously, this can involve real cooperative projects.\nFor example, the Sorenson Institute,  a political leadership institute at the University of Virginia, convenes dialogues that conclude with students putting together a proposal for the Virginia state Legislature on a specific topic such as gun control.\nEven one-off conversations can conclude with what students might do differently on social media, on their campuses and in their families. When I followed up with them, I learned that many students had enacted these changes and found that people changed their own behavior in response. One student found that her uncle started reading and thinking about the articles she would send him. Another student discovered that peers in her political science class who had been dismissive of her in the past became respectful when she expressed her views and seemed to attend to them more sincerely.\n6. Debrief\nSome students will flourish in these conversations, while others will struggle. In my research, I found that students whose rights are threatened by policy proposals of the other side understandably experience the most difficulty. However, these same students\u2019 experiences can be improved by debriefing with a trusted mentor afterward.\nFor example, one student who identifies as queer felt shaken after a discussion with peers who opposed her marriage rights. But meeting with a professor afterward helped her to feel empowered by the conversation, equipped with new knowledge to help her fight for a more just society. \nListening to protest\nDialogue can deepen divides when it is presented as the only appropriate form of political communication, thereby silencing people who do not participate in these conversations. Students should be encouraged to also listen to messages conveyed through other means. For example, they can study protest movements \u2013 including ongoing, contemporary movements \u2013 and read the texts posted by activists who organize them.\nIt is important to convey to students that dialogue alone cannot solve all of what ails contemporary democracy. Protest, boycott and other forms of collective action matter, too.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Politics, US higher education, College students, Dialogue, Political divide, Higher ed attainment, Political dialogue","role":"assistant"}]}

It laid the ground for giants like Star Wars and Star Trek as the first science fiction property to develop a series of sequels alongside live-action and animated TV shows, books, comics and merchandising \u2013 from action figures to lunchboxes.\nAs an expert on Planet of the Apes, it is always exciting to see this groundbreaking franchise continue to be popular. This new film is a strong addition that ties in nicely with the rest of the growing universe. \nKingdom is set 300 years after War for the Planet of the Apes (2017) and the evolution of ape-kind from human companion species to dominant species. Caesar (Andy Serkis), the leader of the apes in the later films of the original series and first three reboots, led his tribe to the promised land. In this sequel, we see the fulfilment of that promise with the Eagle Tribe.\nAn ape-only world is introduced through Noa (Owen Teague), a young chimp from a falconer-clan of chimpanzees that train eagles to hunt for and protect them. Living in electricity pylons, these apes show how the remnants of human architecture and infrastructure have been rewilded and repurposed for the rise of a new dominant species. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe film follows Noa as he is forced from his paradise home to become a hero as he rescues the Eagle Tribe from enslavement by a militarised clan from \u201cthe Forbidden Zone\u201d \u2013 a region beyond the land of the Eagle Tribe \u2013 under the thrawl of bonobo, Promixmus Caesar (Kevin Durand). \nThe Forbidden Zone was a central plot point in the original film and its first sequel Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970). An \u201cancient taboo\u201d according to orangutan clerics (like Dr Zaius in Planet of the Apes) kept apes away from the desert and coastal region that had evidence (specifically The Statue of Liberty) that showed that humans had once been a keystone species. \nIn Kingdom, the Forbidden Zone is home to feral humans and non-peaceful ape tribes. It also  contains proof that humans were once talking intelligent creatures through books containing knowledge of science, technology, philosophy and human history.\nThis is the land that Promixmus Caesar comes from. Proximus is a tyrant king who ruthlessly rules with the belief that he is the second coming of Caesar, the original saviour of the apes.  \n\nJabs at organised religion and the way peaceful teachings (in this case those of the original Caesar\u2019s) can be selectively manipulated for control and power hark back to the religious undertones of the original film. Such critiques are explicitly expressed through the idea of a to-be-worshipped proximus (meaning, the next) Caesar, and references to the \u201cOrder of Caesar\u201d and the original Caesar of the previous films as \u201cThe Lawgiver\u201d. These lay the groundwork for sequels that at least interweave with the original films rather than simply suggesting bland remakes.\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes is the tenth Apes movie and propels the rebooted franchise towards the far-future world of the original movies. It draws explicitly upon references  \u2013 including the Forbidden Zone, subterranean colonies, hunting humans, hidden histories, simian saviours and prospective space-bound futures \u2013 from the original film and the first wave of sequels and prequels. Although you don\u2019t need to have seen the original series, there were lots of easter eggs hidden throughout that might give some clues as to where the franchise will go next.\n\nFor those familiar with the original film the references are numerous and extend beyond using names and shoe-horned quotes (Tom Felton\u2019s \u201ctake your stinking paw off me you damn dirty ape. My father will hear about this\u201d in Rise managed to disappoint Apes fans). \nIn particular, I loved the inclusion of the scarecrow crosses to mark the Forbidden Zone. The sampling of Jerry Goldsmith\u2019s original soundtrack is great, as is the recreation of many of the shots from the original film\u2019s human hunt scene with nets and gorillas on horseback, now armed with cattle prods rather than carbine rifles. It showed director Wes Ball\u2019s engagement with the original and the positioning of this film as prequel of sorts to the 1968 film.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Oscars 2018: why Andy Serkis has yet again been denied the recognition he deserves\n\n\n\n\nAlthough I missed Andy Serkis, the motion capture master who ensured that the first three Apes films were taken seriously (although he was involved as an ape camp advisor, the performances of the actors playing apes are dynamic and engaging. Initial unease about having such a CGI-heavy film are soon forgotten after the thrilling opening scenes of Noa and his friends scavenging for eagle eggs to present to their tribe as part of a coming-of-age ceremony.\nSimilarly, the decision to have production designer Daniel T. Dorrance create real on-location sets to allow as much in-camera shooting as possible \u2013 including a beached freight ship which served as the coastal citadel of Proximus Caesar \u2013 helps to ground the film and the performances.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The Method gone bananas? How motion capture actors are embracing their inner ape\n\n\n\n\nW\u0113t\u0101 FX\u2019s digital work is spectacular and the advances since the 2011 rendering of the apes are striking, but sadly the human characters are somewhat two-dimensional. The majority of humans are seen as feral herds ravaged by the mutated simian flu seen in War that turned humans into mute animals. \nThere are two named human characters, Mae (Freya Allen) and Trevathan (William H. Macy), who both show the worst of humanity\u2019s desire to survive. They set up forthcoming sequels to show that some humans do not succumb to the virus, but will audiences be expected to root for the humans in the future following a ten-film franchise that has so often positioned humanity as unworthy of returning to dominance?\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Film review, Science fiction, CGI, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Visions of the Virgin Mary, in particular, continue to occur regularly within Catholic Christendom.\nThe new document neither endorses supernatural phenomena nor rejects them. Rather, it provides a set of criteria and processes by means of which the church can officially discriminate between them and separate the authentic from the fake. So what do we need to know about these norms?\n\n\n\n\n\nAn old document replaced\nThe new norms replace an earlier document from 1978.\nIn this 1978 document, the decision whether to approve a phenomenon as supernatural or not was essentially left in the hands of a local authority \u2013 in most cases, a diocesan bishop. \nAccording to criteria, the bishop decided on a choice of two options: supernatural, or not. \n\nIn the case of a judgment that a phenomenon was of supernatural origin, he could permit a public manifestation of devotion to the supernatural phenomenon equivalent to his saying, \u201cfor now, nothing stands in the way\u201d (\u201cpro nunc nihil obstat\u201d). \nUnder this document, central control of the Vatican was minimal. Local authorities were in control. \nThe supernatural is under new management\nThe new document is intended to more effectively oversee the validation of such events.  \nIt does so by centralising authorisation, management and control of the supernatural within the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, better known as \u201cthe Inquisition\u201d. Any decision bishops or any other authority wish to make has to be submitted to the Dicastery for approval. \nThe new document declares the Holy Spirit may:\n\nreach our hearts through certain supernatural occurrences such as apparitions or visions of Christ or the Blessed Virgin.\n\nBut the central authority of the church will now decide where, when and how God works, his wonders or miracles to perform.\nOverall, God will be shown to be minimally directly intervening in the world.\nSix new criteria to judge whether God is involved\nRather than a relatively simple judgment whether an event is supernatural or not, the church now provides six possible ways an event can be classified. \nThese range from \u201cnihil obstat\u201d (\u201cnothing stands in the way\u201d) to \u201cdeclaratio de non supernaturalitate\u201d (\u201cdeclaration of non-supernaturality\u201d).\n\nBut even where a nihil obstat is granted, as a rule, neither a diocesan bishop, nor any conference of bishops, nor the Dicastery itself \u201cwill declare that these phenomena are of supernatural origin\u201d. \nIn short, a clear declaration of a supernatural event having taken place will virtually never happen (or, at least, unless the Pope intervenes). \nA declaration of non-supernaturality will be made if it is discovered \n\nthe phenomenon was based on fabrication, on an erroneous intention, or on mythomania. \n\nIn short, if a fake or a hoax is discovered. \nBetween these two extremes lie four other possible judgments. Although there are positive signs of divine action in each of these, they each indicate increasing worries about credibility. The first two of these concern increasing doubts about the credibility of the phenomenon. The next two concern increasing doubts about the honesty of the people involved. \nWhat are the new procedures?\nIf a diocesan bishop, after consultation, believes a supernatural phenomenon requires investigation, he alerts the Dicastery. \nHe then convenes an Investigatory Commission to carry out a \u201ctrial\u201d. This trial will see witness examinations, sworn depositions, expert analysis of written texts, along with technical-scientific, doctrinal and canonical assessments. It is pretty much the traditional method of the Inquisition in modern dress (or vestments).  \n\nThe commission finally makes a judgment on the truth of the matter based on positive and negative criteria.\nPositive criteria include the reputation of persons involved, doctrinal orthodoxy, exclusion of fakery and the fruits of Christian life that have resulted from it. \nNegative criteria include the possibility of manifest error, potential doctrinal errors, breeding of division within the church, an overt pursuit of profit, power, fame or social recognition, and the personal and public ethical rectitude of those involved, along with their mental health.\nIn the light of the commission\u2019s work, the bishop  proposes to the Dicastery a judgment following one of the six ways of classification. The Dicastery then makes a final judgment to be delivered to the bishop, who is obliged to implement the decision and make it public\nCatholicism \u2018disenchanting\u2019 the world\nThere is deep concern within the Vatican over misinformation and disinformation about the supernatural.\nThe document informs us:\n\nNow more than ever, these phenomena involve many people [\u2026] and spread rapidly across different regions and many countries. \n\nThe digital world is a place of multiple meanings where the supernatural occupies a space somewhere between reality and unreality. It is a domain where belief is a matter of choice and disbelief is willingly and happily suspended.\n\nIronically, the outcome of the new norms will be to minimise the number of phenomena recognised as \u201csupernatural\u201d within the Catholic Church. In effect, it will put stricter limits on God\u2019s action within the world. \nThe new norms within the church to  manage the supernatural are intended more to \u201cdisenchant\u201d the world than further to \u201cenchant\u201d it.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Catholic church, Vatican, Jesus, Supernatural, Mary, Apparitions","role":"assistant"}]}

Hamas wants a permanent ceasefire leading to the establishment of a \u201cfully sovereign\u201d Palestinian state. The Israeli government \u2013 particularly the more rightwing nationalistic elements \u2013 wants Hamas destroyed completely. It\u2019s not clear these conflicting positions can be reconciled.\nInsurgencies can be defeated by eliminating the insurgent militarily, or by effectively addressing the grievances that prompted them to take up arms \u2013 or a combination of both. This means continuing conflict while negotiating a peace deal in good faith.\nIn Northern Ireland, the British were persuaded to do both and it worked. In Palestine, Israel uses force with considerable effect \u2013 but in the absence of peacemaking, this force is counterproductive. The grievance remains unaddressed and the insurgency grows.\nIn his 2023 address marking the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, US senator George Mitchell rightly pointed out that without John Hume, there would have been no peace process, and without David Trimble, there would have been no peace agreement. Both received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1998: Hume for persuading Sinn Fein and its military wing, the Provisional IRA, to pursue a constitutional path to peace, and for bringing in the US as peace brokers. \n\n\n\n\n\nAs a result, the then-US president, Bill Clinton, took up this initiative and persuaded the British to do likewise. The Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Brooke, declared that the British had no selfish or strategic interests in Northern Ireland, ceasefires were agreed, and an effective, inclusive peace process was implemented.\nThat peace process was not easy. It took the combined political effort of the Irish and British governments, the US presidency and the EU to get there. But peace was achieved, and with Sinn Fein now sharing power with the other constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, the insurgency no longer has such a grievance. It seems unlikely that Northern Ireland will go back to war. \nCan Israel do the same? I believe so. I came to this conclusion when I met with Hamas on December 3 2008, while making preparations for Mitchell to start work as newly elected US president Barack Obama\u2019s special envoy for Middle East peace. \nIn the image below are the notes I took during that meeting in Ramallah \u2013 a series of bullet points summarising the Hamas negotiating position.\n\nThey show that Hamas was serious about a peace process. It was prepared to guarantee the security of Israel, and accept a Palestinian state within the internationally recognised borders following the war of 1967. \nIt also reflects a degree of scepticism about Israel\u2019s willingness to negotiate in good faith, and frustration at the failure of the international community to fully implement UN resolutions aimed at bringing peace to the region. \nBut it shows Hamas was ready to engage. Political organisations such as Sinn Fein and Hamas have good intelligence, so Hamas would have known before I met them all about me, and my role in running public opinion polls in Northern Ireland to gauge sentiment on all sides prior to forging the Good Friday Agreement.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Israel-Gaza: how opinion polls used in Northern Ireland could pave a way to peace\n\n\n\n\nFrom our meeting, it was clear that Hamas was willing to be part of an inclusive peace process when Mitchell took up his post  in 2009.\nAccepting change\nParamilitary organisations such as Sinn Fein and Hamas have to bring their followers with them on the difficult journey to peace. On this point, I was able to help Sinn Fein deal with a critical problem which has also been a problem for Hamas: its constitution. \n\nSinn Fein\u2019s constitution prohibited it taking seats in a Northern Ireland assembly \u2013 it could only participate in a parliament that represented a united Ireland. So, arguably, it had negotiated the Good Friday Agreement in bad faith.\nTo help fix this problem, we drafted and ran some questions that clearly demonstrated that Sinn Fein voters wanted their own representatives in the new Northern Ireland assembly, along with everyone else. On the back of this result, Sinn Fein called a special Ard Fheis (general meeting) and changed its constitution so it could agree to and endorse the Good Friday Agreement. \nWhen I met with Hamas in 2008, I was certain that, given the opportunity \u2013 and the prospect of gaining legitimate constitutional power \u2013 Hamas would have done the same, and accepted the two-state solution.\nMahdi Abdul-Hadi, director of East Jerusalem-based thinktank the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, helped set up my first meeting with Hamas in 2008. When I saw him again in Jerusalem in May this year, he told me there are now \u201ctwo Hamas\u201d. Since I was there in 2008, it has split into the Gaza faction under Yahya Sinwar, and the political bureau led by Ismail Haniyeh in Qatar.\nSinn Fein and the Provisional IRA had to confront a similar issue during the Northern Ireland peace process, with the breakaway group that called itself the Real IRA. But with the success of Sinn Fein as a constitutional political party sharing power, the Real IRA is no longer a significant threat.\nSadly, the failure of the Israeli peace process in 2009 has led to a very different outcome: 1,200 Israeli dead on October 7 last year, and 37,000 and counting Palestinian dead since then. \nOn October 18 2023, the US president, Joe Biden, advised the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, not to repeat the errors the US had made after 9\/11. He might also have suggested Netanyahu learn the lessons of Northern Ireland and make peace with his Palestinian neighbours.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Israel, Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, Hamas, Benjamin Netanyahu, IRA, Give me perspective, George Mitchell, Israeli-Palestinian conflict","role":"assistant"}]}

Good negotiations greatly improve relationships between buyers, sellers and agents. They also help avoid future problems and conflicts.\nNegotiating skills become even more important for home buyers in a \u201cseller\u2019s market\u201d, where demand from buyers exceeds supply from sellers. That\u2019s currently the case in all Australian capital cities and major regional cities such as Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast and others.\nMany home buyers mistakenly believe negotiation only occurs during the signing of the sale contract. However, it involves distinct stages: pre-negotiation and during negotiation.\nSo how can people maximise their chances of successfully negotiating a purchase in a seller\u2019s market? I offer the following tips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe someone the seller\u2019s agent wants to do business with\nBuyers often communicate solely with the seller\u2019s agent, rather than directly with the seller. It\u2019s crucial to ensure the agent views the buyer positively. Ultimately, it\u2019s the agent who presents offers to the seller for their decision.\nIt\u2019s important, then, to understand what might motivate the seller\u2019s agent to choose your offer. The key performance indicator for the agent often revolves around closing a property sale at a reasonable price within a certain time. \nThis means price is a crucial factor. However, other factors can influence the seller\u2019s agent and seller.\nFor example, having pre-approved finance can increase the agent\u2019s confidence in the buyer. If the buyer appears serious, can make quick decisions and makes a good impression, the agent may be more motivated to push for them, even if their offer is slightly lower than others without pre-approved finance. \nBe a big fish (for the seller\u2019s agent)\nThe next strategy is to give the seller\u2019s agent extra incentive to favour you and  your offer. Our research in customer behaviour suggests businesses value customers who make frequent purchases or engage them for long-term services. \nFor example, the agent would be pleased to learn that the buyer might be interested in buying another property in the near future or in using their rental service for the new property. You have an advantage if you can position yourself as someone who could provide them with extra business.\nPoint to competing options\nIn a positive manner, let the seller\u2019s agent know you are considering two or three properties, and this specific property is among those you are inclined to make an offer on. \nIn certain situations, it may stimulate competitive pricing when multiple  properties of similar quality are available in the same area. Make it clear to the agent you will choose the property that offers you the best overall value.\nWhile this strategy might not necessarily lower the price in a seller\u2019s market, it can prompt the agent to have a fuller discussion with you. \n\nThink beyond price\nThe next set of tips focuses on the during negotiation stages. It can be challenging for buyers to negotiate a lower price in a market with low supply and high demand. You might have to \u201cthink outside the price box\u201d.\nBuyers often have a specific price range or fixed budget in mind when they start  discussions with a seller. However, other factors besides price can influence a property\u2019s overall value.\nSo if a seller won\u2019t adjust the price, consider negotiating for other concessions that could reduce your expenses. \nThese may include:\nSettlement period\nConsider the expenses associated with the settlement period. A shorter settlement period could enable buyers to move into the property sooner and save on rent. For example, if a buyer is paying $600 per week in rent, an early settlement could save them around $2,400 per month.\nInsurance costs after contract signing\nIn many states, buyers\u2019 home insurance cover is required to begin from the date of contract signing. It\u2019s reasonable for buyers to include a special condition requesting the seller to bear the insurance costs until settlement. On average, home insurance may amount to about $140 per month.\nCleaning expenses\nConsider negotiating a condition stipulating that the seller must ensure the property is professionally cleaned by settlement. Failure to do so could result in a $500 adjustment in the buyer\u2019s favour at settlement. \nIn some states, like Queensland, sellers are not obligated to deliver a clean property. Based on typical end-of-lease cleaning charges, internal cleaning of a four-bedroom property could cost $455 to $590.\nBuilding and pest inspection costs\nBuyers should always include a 14-day pre-purchase inspection clause for building and pest inspections in their offer. Although they may cost $300 to $600, these inspections provide a clear report that could lead to negotiations after contract signing if they find any issues with the property.\nBe careful with your first offer\nDon\u2019t present the first offer in writing. It can be challenging to negotiate down the price once it has been written in an offer document.\nInstead, the buyer should begin by testing the expected price of the property. As well as obtaining property reports from multiple banks, the buyer could talk with the seller\u2019s agent in person about a price range that would be agreeable to the seller. \nYou could include phrases like \u201ca price that will make the seller happy\u201d or \u201ca price that will make the seller accept the offer\u201d. While the agent might not provide a specific price, this talk can provide a guideline for the buyer. All properties up for auction or private sale should have an expected price set, which may or may not be discussed with potential buyers. \nIt\u2019s also advisable to consult a solicitor before submitting an offer or signing a contract. They can offer valuable suggestions to smooth the purchase process and identify any issues.\n\nUse the power of 900\nBuyers often submit offers with round numbers, such as $700,000 or $750,000. In a competitive seller\u2019s market, aim to submit an offer with a number that stands out from the rest, yet remains within your budget. \nAn example of such a number is $900. For instance, comparing $700,000 to $700,900, the extra $900 makes the offer feel closer to $710,000.\nWrite a personalised letter\nIt\u2019s true the most important point of selling a house for many sellers is price. But they are human and have emotions.  Finishing a purchasing offer with a personal letter to the seller can make a difference. \nOften that $3,000 to $20,000 could be a lot of money for a buyer, but it may not be as much for someone selling a house for  $700,000 or $1,000,000. Write the letter to express your feelings about the property in a way that makes it clear you will care for it. Most people selling their home would prefer to have someone look after it well.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Housing, Negotiation, Housing market, Society, Homes, Australian property market, Negotiating, Residential real estate, Negotiation tactics, Better Cities","role":"assistant"}]}

A survey carried out in 2023 by the Law Society, the Legal Services Board and YouGov found that two-thirds of respondents had experienced a legal issue in the past four years. The most common problems were employment, finance, welfare and benefits and consumer issues. \nBut not everyone can afford to pay for legal advice. Of those survey respondents with legal problems, only 52% received professional help, 11% had assistance from other people such as family and friends and the remainder received no help at all. \nMany people turn to the internet for legal help. And now that we have access to artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Microsoft Co-Pilot and Claude, you might be thinking about asking them a legal question.\nThese tools are powered by generative AI, which generates content when prompted with a question or instruction. They can quickly explain complicated legal information in a straightforward, conversational style, but are they accurate?\n\n\n\n\n\nWe put the chatbots to the test in a recent study published in the International Journal of Clinical Legal Education. We entered the same six legal questions on family, employment, consumer and housing law into ChatGPT 3.5 (free version), ChatGPT 4 (paid version), Microsoft Bing and Google Bard. The questions were ones we typically receive in our free online law clinic at The Open University Law School. \nWe found that these tools can indeed provide legal advice, but the answers were not always reliable or accurate. Here are five common mistakes we observed:\n1. Where is the law from?\nThe first answers the chatbots provided were often based on American law. This was often not stated or obvious. Without legal knowledge, the user would likely assume the law related to where they live. The chatbot sometimes did not explain that law differs depending on where you live. \nThis is especially complex in the UK, where laws differ between England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. For example, the law on renting a house in Wales is different to Scotland, Northern Ireland and England, while Scottish and English courts have different procedures to deal with divorce and the ending of a civil partnership.\nIf necessary, we used one additional question: \u201cis there any English law that covers this problem?\u201d We had to use this instruction for most of the questions, and then the chatbot produced an answer based on English law.\n2. Out of date law\nWe also found that sometimes the answer to our question referred to out of date law, which has been replaced by new legal rules. For example, the divorce law changed in April 2022 to remove fault-based divorce in England and Wales. \nSome responses referred to the old law. AI chatbots are trained on large volumes of data \u2013 we don\u2019t always know how current the data is, so it may not include the most recent legal developments.\n\n3. Bad advice\nWe found most of the chatbots gave incorrect or misleading advice when dealing with the family and employment queries. The answers to the housing and consumer questions were better, but there were still gaps in the responses. Sometimes, they missed really important aspects of the law, or explained it incorrectly.\nWe found that the answers produced by the AI chatbots were well-written, which could make them appear more convincing. Without having legal knowledge, it is very difficult for someone to determine whether an answer produced is correct and applies to their individual circumstances. \nEven though this technology is relatively new, there have already been cases of people relying on chatbots in court. In a civil case in Manchester, a litigant representing themselves in court reportedly presented fictitious legal cases to support their argument. They said they had used ChatGPT to find the cases.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Generative AI is changing the legal profession \u2013 future lawyers need to know how to use it\n\n\n\n\n4. Too generic\nIn our study, the answers didn\u2019t provide enough detail for someone to understand their legal issue and know how to resolve them. The answers provided information on a topic rather than specifically addressing the legal question. \nInterestingly, the AI chatbots were better at suggesting practical, non-legal ways to address a problem. While this can be useful as a first step to resolving an issue, it does not always work, and legal steps may be needed to enforce your rights.\n5. Pay to play\nWe found that ChatGPT4 (the paid version) was better overall than the free versions. This risks further reinforcing digital and legal inequality. \nThe technology is evolving, and there may come a time when AI chatbots are better able to provide legal advice. Until then, people need to be aware of the risks when using them to resolve their legal problems. Other sources of help such as Citizens Advice will provide up to date, accurate information and are better placed to assist.\nAll the chatbots gave answers to our questions but, in their response, stated it was not their function to provide legal advice and recommended getting professional help. After conducting this study, we recommend the same.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"ChatGPT, AI chatbots, Motivate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Taking direct positive action can help you cope with your eco-anxiety while helping to address the climate emergency. \nClimate anxiety is not a pathology but a healthy response to a real threat. Inaction is related to feeling powerless whereas action is about taking control.\nMy team of social psychologists recently surveyed over 1,200 people in collaboration with charity GlobalGiving UK. This research focused on eco-anxiety and other drivers of donations to provide disaster relief for climate-related disasters. \nWe found that younger people reported higher levels of eco-anxiety: people under 30 were four times more likely to report climate anxiety than those over 50. These results tally with another study which also found that younger people and children in particular are bearing the emotional burden of climate change. \n\n\n\n\n\nMany young people are experiencing the threat to our planet on a personal, visceral level. In addition, our survey found that women were more likely to experience climate anxiety than men, and taken together it was particularly young women who were most anxious. \nOur results also found that respondents experiencing high levels of climate anxiety were more likely to want to donate to disasters caused by climate change. \n\nAlthough climate anxiety can motivate people to want to alleviate the effects of climate change \u2013 which is clearly a good thing \u2013 the experience of anxiety is often deeply unpleasant. Many people struggling with climate fears wonder how to manage those emotions. \nTraditional approaches for managing anxiety emphasise physical activity, breathing and meditation, distraction and spending time in nature, and therapy and medication. They see anxiety as a pathological condition that requires treatment, rather than a healthy emotional response to a real global threat. Although traditional treatments for anxiety might reduce distress for individuals, they do nothing to address the climate emergency. \nTaking positive action is good for defending yourself against debilitating anxiety, as demonstrated by research about a practice known as acceptance commitment therapy. While you can\u2019t solve the climate crisis alone, you can join forces with others to build a powerful movement and engage in emotionally intelligent change making. \nSo, if you want to act but don\u2019t know where to start, here are three ways to make a tangible positive impact while helping to manage your anxiety: \n1. Donate to climate charities\nYou can channel your anxiety into action by helping those impacted by climate-related disasters, for example through donating to climate-related causes.  \nSmall actions are empowering both for you and those who benefit from your generosity. Evidence suggests that helping others is good for your own wellbeing. Helping people who are being directly affected by climate change, by donating to disaster relief for example, can make a positive difference to others while at the same time boosting your own wellbeing. \nSelect a climate-related project that resonates with you and ensures your contribution reaches those at the forefront of the climate crisis. Some of the organisations doing important climate-related work within their communities include a Brazilian forest conservation project called Iracambi, Greek permaculture iniatives at the Sporos Regeneration Institute and Scotland\u2019s seagrass restoration charity, Seawilding.\n2. Make environment top priority at work\nAdvocate for positive climate action more widely. Let your employer know that you and your colleagues expect them to have a strong environment, social and governance (ESG) agenda. ESG refers to a company\u2019s commitment to do more than make a profit, to actively strive to contribute to environmental and social causes and to conduct business in an ethical and responsible way that adds to society. \nBusiness goals of profit making and goals of acting responsibly are not always well aligned. Employees pushing for the importance of ESG can incentivise companies to not prioritise profit over environmental impact. Our study showed that more than 50% of respondents wanted employers to address climate change. This figure rose to 73% in under 30s, but there\u2019s still scope for more people to call for employers to engage with climate issues. \nA demand from employees for climate action forces those companies to act on climate change. Advocacy can not only encourage corporate action against climate change, it\u2019s also empowering. Research highlights that working for an organisation with a shared sense of purpose and identity can be a huge boon to your own wellbeing.\n3. Share your worries and amplify solutions\nAmplify your mission by talking to others about your climate-related worries. Sharing worries is a powerful tool for managing them. Sharing concerns can help you find others who have similar fears, which will ease the pressure. There is comfort in community, solidarity and in knowing that you are not alone with your worries. \nThis might entail simply having frank conversations about your fears with family and friends, or it can involve joining a network or actions organised by groups such as the Climate Psychology Alliance or the Climate Coalition. \nCombining forces with like-minded people is essential for coordinated action that addresses climate issues. Those same tangible steps that help create a more resilient, interconnected world can also provide comfort and help alleviate anxieties.\n\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read about climate change as much as you\u2019d like?\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\n\u201cI would describe myself as a socialist. I describe myself as a progressive\u201d. These were Labour leader Keir Starmer\u2019s words in May 2024 shortly after his first speech of the election campaign. Labour\u2019s constitution defines it as a democratic socialist party. So, in theory, Starmer is a socialist.\nBut what is socialism? One concept of socialism characterises it as being about collective ownership in pursuit of the public good, over private ownership for profit. \nSome see a commitment to economic equality as what distinguishes socialism from other ideologies. Others specify co-operation and community reigning over individualism as defining socialism. Or, socialism can be seen as a movement for, or of, the working class.\nWhichever it is, democratic socialism is about building a society beyond capitalism. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe day after Starmer proclaimed himself a socialist, his shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves was asked about his statement and responded that she was a social democrat. Social democracy is about socialism, but within capitalism rather than beyond it. \nReeves\u2019 definition of social democracy in terms of equal opportunities, good public services, and secure work that pays (very much in tune with Starmer\u2019s platform) does not go as far as socialism within capitalism. Others across the political spectrum could agree with the values she outlined.  \nStarmer was active in socialist politics in his youth. But we should decide where he stands by what he says and does now. Labour\u2019s purges of socialists in the party have led some to conclude that Starmer wants rid of those who might try to hold him to socialist principles. \nWhat do Starmer\u2019s statements of values and principles tell us? In 2020 he argued for \u201cmoral socialism\u201d, so an approach that is based on values as much as structures. \nHe highlighted injustice especially, but also inequality. There\u2019s a left-of-centre or even socialist tone to the moral socialism he advocated then. But was he just trying to win over Corbynite members for his party leadership bid? \nIn a 2021 pamphlet on his philosophy as leader Starmer shifted to values of security and opportunity, which he has since continued to put centre stage. He said class holds people back, stressed community over individualism, and active government over the free market. \nYou don\u2019t have to be a socialist to believe in security and opportunity. However, class inequality, community, and active government have left-of-centre or socialist connotations.\nFrom values to policies\nBut the proof of a philosophy is in the practice. Labour will set up Great British Energy, a publicly owned company to invest in renewables. Starmer says he will bring passenger train services in-house, and facilitate municipal insourcing and ownership, and more co-ops. \nThese are small steps to more collective ownership in the economy and public services. But social ownership could be much more widespread, especially given public support for it, including for the energy utilities, water supply and the Royal Mail.\nStarmer talks about the tackling the \u201cclass ceiling\u201d for working class people and about inequality, especially in policies (or intentions) on education and the new deal for working people. But the emphasis is on equal or minimum opportunities for all rather than a more economically equal society.\nHe will fund policies by clamping down on tax breaks for the privileged and a windfall tax on energy utilities. But significant redistributional changes to the tax structure, on income or wealth, aren\u2019t proposed. \nStarmer expresses sentiments of community and co-operation over individualism. But these tend to be used in relation to policies on security, devolution, localities, a more active state, or partnership with business, rather than institutions of a more specifically socialist sort.\n\nIn fact, Starmer\u2019s perspective on community has metamorphosed into advocacy of a \u201ccontribution society\u201d. This is used to mean varying things, such as that people and business should contribute rather than being individualistic, and that their contribution should be rewarded decently. This is about responsibility and reward as much as community in a socialist sense.\nWhat is modern socialism?\nIf socialism on the definitions I\u2019ve outlined isn\u2019t being proposed by Starmer, it could be that he\u2019s redefining socialism for modern Britain. If this involves new means for pursuing socialism, he\u2019s not propounding this. \nIf it\u2019s redefining socialism as something beyond collective ownership, equality, and co-operation, that\u2019s not rethinking socialism for a new era. It\u2019s dropping what makes socialism distinctive. \nIf it involves a more intersectional socialism, Starmer is proposing measures on race equality and violence against women, but these match his self-description as \u201cprogressive\u201d more than being \u201csocialist\u201d.\nStarmer could be putting forward limited policies for the general election, only to then come out as more leftist in office. Active government could be extended to wider social ownership; opportunities for the working class expanded to a more equal structure to society, a foundation also for greater community. Starmer is not advocating such a route. But down it, he could just have a case for calling himself a socialist.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Socialism, Labour Party, Labour manifesto, Keir Starmer, Election 2024, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

Both Winton the subject and Jones the artist see our planet is on a path to environmental doom. \nJones met Winton when she was undertaking a residency to study the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef, so it is appropriate the tones she has chosen as the background to his portrait are dull and muted like a degraded world. \n\n\n\n\n\nMost of the painting is thinly painted with the exception of his face. This gives the portrait an extra impact. \nAlthough Laura Jones has been a finalist in four previous Archibald Prize exhibitions and has exhibited widely, her profile indicates the only significant collection to hold her work is Artbank, the collection of the Australian government.  \nThat is all about to change.\n\nIn what may be a coincidence, another exhibition on the same floor is a solo exhibition by a previous Archibald winner, Wendy Sharpe, whose painterly approach is similar to Jones. \nSharpe\u2019s work not only relates to Jones\u2019 painting in style, but also the circumstance of her winning the prize. In 1996, Sharpe was a relatively unknown artist when she too was awarded the Archibald Prize. The prize was the trigger for a career that has included a stint of being a Gallery Trustee. \nThe Archibald really does sprinkle fairy dust.\nDjaka\u014bu Yunupi\u014bu wins the Wynne Prize\nWhen the board president of the trustees, David Gonski, announced the Wynne Prize he took great joy in noting this year the majority of the entrants selected for hanging were Aboriginal artists.\nAwarded to \u201cthe best landscape painting of Australian scenery in oils or watercolours or for the best example of figure sculpture by Australian artists\u201d, this oldest of all Australian art prizes has come a long way from when it was dominated by paintings of gum trees in pastoral landscapes. \nDjaka\u014bu Yunupi\u014bu\u2019s painting, Nyalala gurmilili, is a celebration of sunrise in Mi\u1e0fawarr (the harvest season following the wet) when sudden showers surprise during the day. \n\nIt is probably the largest bark painting to be exhibited in the gallery, a glorious undulating pattern of rhythms and shapes. \nThere is a special significance in this artist being awarded the prize for this work at this gallery. \nMany years ago her father, Mu\u014bgurrawuy Yunupi\u014bu, was one of a group of Yolngu elders who sat with the gallery\u2019s assistant director, Tony Tuckson, and showed him the connection between painting and lore. Mu\u014bgurrawuy Yunupi\u014bu\u2019s bark paintings are among the treasures of the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s collection.\nNaomi Kantjuriny wins the Sulman Prize\nUnlike the Archibald and Wynne Prizes, which are judged by the trustees, the Sulman Prize for best subject painting, genre painting or mural project has a single judge, usually an artist. \nThis means every year the exhibition has a different flavour, reflecting the judge\u2019s taste. This year\u2019s judge, Tom Polo, selected an exhibition ranging from the traditional formalism of David Eastwood to the conceptual humour of Kenny Pittock. \n\nHe has awarded the prize to Naomi Kantjuriny for her painting Minyma mamu tjuta, from the Tjala Arts Centre. She has described her painting as being about the stories told and her culture. \nIt is a lively painting of spirits, good and bad, dancing in the land, gathering around people, always present.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Archibald Prize 2024: this year\u2019s finalists range from downright fun to politically ferocious\n\n\n\n\nThe Archibald, Wynne and Sulman Prizes 2024 are on display at the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney, until September 8.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Australian art, Tim WInton, Wynne Prize, Sulman Prize, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Visual art and design","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nTaylor Swift is famous for writing her life (and, most notoriously, her ex-boyfriends) into her music. \nBut she is also fascinated by history, and regularly incorporates historic figures, places and events into her songs. An avid reader since early childhood, Swift has long drawn inspiration from women of the past (both real and fictional) who challenged social conventions and were punished for not conforming to traditional gender roles. \nIn her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, Swift positions herself in a long history of women who upset patriarchal norms \u2014 women accused of \u201cbehaving badly\u201d \u2014 while also revealing the importance of revisiting our understanding of the past based on shifting evidence. \nExploring fictional and family stories\nWith the albums folklore and evermore (both released in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic), Swift moved away from purely autobiographical storytelling to exploring other people\u2019s lives.  \n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to creating a cast of fictional characters, she also delved into her family history, with moving songs about her paternal grandfather who fought in  the Battle of Guadalcanal during the Second World War (\u201cEpiphany\u201d) and her maternal grandmother (\u201cMarjorie\u201d), whose career as an opera singer was limited by marital and maternal responsibilities. \n\n\u2018Last Great American Dynasty\u2019\nBut it\u2019s \u201cThe Last Great American Dynasty\u201d on folklore that marked a major shift in Swift\u2019s songwriting. Swift recounts the life of Rebekah Harkness (1915-1982), the American composer and philanthropist who married the heir to the Standard Oil fortune and scandalized her wealthy neighbours with her eccentric behaviour. \nIn a surprising twist, Swift reveals that she now owns the Rhode Island saltbox house where Harkness threw her wild parties, and Swift is now the crazy woman upsetting the neighbours. Swift not only reflects on how she continues to be perceived by society and portrayed in the media, but also questions the extent to which attitudes toward women who are \u201cdifferent\u201d have actually changed since the 1950s.\n\u2018The Bolter\u2019\nSimilarly, Swift appears to be alluding to how her own dating history has been recounted and scrutinized by the media. Some commentators think Swift explores the life of Lady Idina Sackville (1893-1955), the English aristocrat who scandalized upper-class society for marrying five times. Because she left her husbands so frequently and suddenly, Sackville was nicknamed \u201cthe Bolter,\u201d (also the title of Swift\u2019s track on Tortured Poets). \nSackville was also the inspiration for English novelist Nancy Mitford\u2019s character the Bolter, also the name of a book by Sackville\u2019s great-granddaughter Frances Osborne about Sackville\u2019s life. \n\nSwift\u2019s track could be heard to imagine Sackville\u2019s perspective, allowing her to explain what attracted her to these men but why she eventually sought to escape them, regardless of the social cost of taking back her freedom. It\u2019s not clear if Swift is writing about Sackville or if she is writing about herself. Either way, we are asked again to question how much has changed for women. \nMadness, misogyny, female rage\n\nThe themes of madness, misogyny, fame and female rage are at the heart of Tortured Poets, and Swift frequently invokes women of the past as a poetic device to add meaning and nuance to her stories. \nIn addition to likening herself to a witch, Eve and the Trojan priestess Cassandra, she references American poet and musician Patti Smith, rock legend Stevie Nicks and the hugely successful 1920s silent film actress Clara Bow, who abandoned stardom in 1933 at age 28 after being treated terribly by Hollywood.  \nSwift places herself within this pantheon of 20th-century American women artists who, in their different ways, fought against the sexism of the entertainment industry. \nSwift is keenly aware that she is herself both active making history and a product of a particular moment in time, living in a world shaped by the events and people that came before her. While she has agency \u2014 she actually wields far more power than most \u2014 she operates within systems that continue to limit and affect her choices. \n\nRe-interpreting past relationships\nAt this year\u2019s Grammy Awards, when Swift announced she had recorded a new album, fans assumed it would focus on the end of her relationship with actor Joe Alwyn, her boyfriend of six years with whom she had broken up shortly after the start of her Eras Tour in the spring of 2023. \nBut fans are now convinced that much of what turned out to be The Tortured Poets Department surprise double album is about her on-again-off-again \u201csituationship\u201d with Matty Healy, the controversial frontman of the English band The 1975 who was reviled by many Swifties. Fans have gone back to Swift\u2019s previous albums to reinterpret them through the lens of this revelation. \nWere the songs that had once been assumed to be about Alwyn, including those on her 2017 album reputation, actually about Healy? Were the fictional characters in folklore real after all?\nSwift\u2019s discography is her archive, each album a collection of files that she has chosen to declassify. These newly released files can help her fans fill in some of the gaps on the Swiftian timeline, and shed new light on what they already know. \n\nSwift\u2019s own shifting story\nOn the one hand, drawing renewed attention to her past work and keeping her own versions of her older albums streaming is a slick business move by Swift. But new information can also challenge previous assumptions and interpretations, and be devastating to those who hold dear a particular image of their beloved Taylor. \nSwift seems to understand that history isn\u2019t supposed to be comfortable. Just as she has reinterpreted the stories of Rebekah Harkness, Lady Idina and Clara Bow, she knows all too well that the way her story has and will be told will change over time. And she is ready for it.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Archives, Women's history, Taylor Swift, Patriarchy, Writing History, Albums, The Tortured Poets Department","role":"assistant"}]}

The heliosphere, the area of space influenced by the Sun, is over a hundred times larger than the distance from the Sun to the Earth.\nThe Sun is a star that constantly emits a steady stream of plasma \u2013 highly energized ionized gas \u2013 called the solar wind. In addition to the constant solar wind, the Sun also occasionally releases eruptions of plasma called coronal mass ejections, which can contribute to the aurora, and bursts of light and energy, called flares. \nThe plasma coming off the Sun expands through space, along with the Sun\u2019s magnetic field. Together they form the heliosphere within the surrounding local interstellar medium \u2013 the plasma, neutral particles and dust that fill the space between stars and their respective astrospheres. Heliophysicists like me want to understand the heliosphere and how it interacts with the interstellar medium.\nThe eight known planets in the solar system, the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and the Kuiper Belt \u2013 the band of celestial objects beyond Neptune that includes the planetoid Pluto \u2013 all reside within the heliosphere. The heliosphere is so large that objects in the Kuiper Belt orbit closer to the Sun than to the closest boundary of the heliosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeliosphere protection\nAs distant stars explode, they expel large amounts of radiation into interstellar space in the form of highly energized particles known as cosmic rays. These cosmic rays can be dangerous for living organisms and can damage electronic devices and spacecraft. \nEarth\u2019s atmosphere protects life on the planet from the effects of cosmic radiation, but, even before that, the heliosphere itself acts as a cosmic shield from most interstellar radiation. \nIn addition to cosmic radiation, neutral particles and dust stream steadily into the heliosphere from the local interstellar medium. These particles can affect the space around Earth and may even alter how the solar wind reaches the Earth.\nSupernovae and the interstellar medium may have also influenced the origins of life and the evolution of humans on Earth. Some researchers predict that millions of years ago, the heliosphere came into contact with a cold, dense particle cloud in the interstellar medium that caused the heliosphere to shrink, exposing the Earth to the local interstellar medium. \nAn unknown shape\nBut scientists don\u2019t really know what the heliosphere\u2019s shape is. Models range in shape from spherical to cometlike to croissant-shaped. These predictions vary in size by hundreds to thousands of times the distance from the Sun to the Earth.\nScientists have, however, defined the direction that the Sun is moving as the \u201cnose\u201d direction and the opposing direction as the \u201ctail\u201d direction. The nose direction should have the shortest distance to the heliopause \u2013 the boundary between the heliosphere and the local interstellar medium. \n\nNo probe has ever gotten a good look at the heliosphere from the outside or properly sampled the local interstellar medium. Doing so could tell scientists more about the heliosphere\u2019s shape and its interaction with the local interstellar medium, the space environment beyond the heliosphere. \nCrossing the heliopause with Voyager\nIn 1977, NASA launched the Voyager mission: Its two spacecraft flew past Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune in the outer solar system. Scientists have determined that after observing these gas giants, the probes separately crossed the heliopause and into interstellar space in 2012 and 2018, respectively.\nWhile Voyager 1 and 2 are the only probes to have ever potentially crossed the heliopause, they are well beyond their intended mission lifetimes. They can no longer return the necessary data as their instruments slowly fail or power down.\nThese spacecraft were designed to study planets, not the interstellar medium. This means they don\u2019t have the right instruments to take all the measurements of the interstellar medium or the heliosphere that scientists need. \nThat\u2019s where a potential interstellar probe mission could come in. A probe designed to fly beyond the heliopause would help scientists understand the heliosphere by observing it from the outside.\nAn interstellar probe\nSince the heliosphere is so large, it would take a probe decades to reach the boundary, even using a gravity assist from a massive planet like Jupiter. \nThe Voyager spacecraft will no longer be able to provide data from interstellar space long before an interstellar probe exits the heliosphere. And once the probe is launched, depending on the trajectory, it will take about 50 or more years to reach the interstellar medium. This means that the longer NASA waits to launch a probe, the longer scientists will be left with no missions operating in the outer heliosphere or the local interstellar medium. \nNASA is considering developing an interstellar probe. This probe would take measurements of the plasma and magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and image the heliosphere from the outside. To prepare, NASA asked for input from more than 1,000 scientists on a mission concept.\nThe initial report recommended the probe travel on a trajectory that is about 45 degrees away from the heliosphere\u2019s nose direction. This trajectory would retrace part of Voyager\u2019s path, while reaching some new regions of space. This way, scientists could study new regions and revisit some partly known regions of space. \nThis path would give the probe only a partly angled view of the heliosphere, and it wouldn\u2019t be able to see the heliotail, the region scientists know the least about.\nIn the heliotail, scientists predict that the plasma that makes up the heliosphere mixes with the plasma that makes up the interstellar medium. This happens through a process called magnetic reconnection, which allows charged particles to stream from the local interstellar medium into the heliosphere. Just like the neutral particles entering through the nose, these particles affect the space environment within the heliosphere. \nIn this case, however, the particles have a charge and can interact with solar and planetary magnetic fields. While these interactions occur at the boundaries of the heliosphere, very far from Earth, they affect the makeup of the heliosphere\u2019s interior.\nIn a new study published in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences, my colleagues and I evaluated six potential launch directions ranging from the nose to the tail. We found that rather than exiting close to the nose direction, a trajectory intersecting the heliosphere\u2019s flank toward the tail direction would give the best perspective on the heliosphere\u2019s shape. \nA trajectory along this direction would present scientists with a unique opportunity to study a completely new region of space within the heliosphere. When the probe exits the heliosphere into interstellar space, it would get a view of the heliosphere from the outside at an angle that would give scientists a more detailed idea of its shape \u2013 especially in the disputed tail region.\nIn the end, whichever direction an interstellar probe launches, the science it returns will be invaluable and quite literally astronomical.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Astronomy, Space, NASA, Solar system, Universe, Sun, Voyager, Earth, Cosmos, Star","role":"assistant"}]}

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to curiouskidsus@theconversation.com.\n\n\nWhy do astronomers look for signs of life on other planets based on how life is on Earth? Couldn\u2019t there be totally different kinds of life on other planets? \u2013 Henry, age 13, Somerville, Massachusetts\n\n\nHave you ever played hide-and-seek in a new place? It\u2019s much harder than playing at home. You only know the obvious hiding spots: under the bed, in the closet, behind the couch. The trick is trying to think of hiding spots you can\u2019t even imagine. How do you search in places you never thought could be hiding spots?\nThat is kind of what scientists like me do when we look for alien life; we\u2019re trying to think of new ways to look for life. In the meantime, we\u2019re looking for life by looking for life like us because that\u2019s what we can imagine.\nLooking nearby\nThe closest place to look for extraterrestrial life is on planets within our solar system.\n\n\n\n\n\nNASA\u2019s Viking 1 mission began orbiting Earth\u2019s neighbor Mars back in 1976. Looking for life on Mars was one of the most important scientific questions for the mission. The spacecraft included a lander that could go to the planet\u2019s surface to see if there were any life-forms in the dirt there.\n\nScientists knew that life on Mars could be really different from life on Earth, so they didn\u2019t look for specific life-forms or molecules. Instead, they tried to design experiments to look for what life does, rather than what it makes.\nFor example, plants and some other life-forms on Earth do photosynthesis, a process that uses sunlight and carbon dioxide in the air to gather energy and grow. The Viking 1 scientists designed the lander to look for signs of photosynthesis happening on Mars.\nTo do that, the lander scooped up some dirt, shined a light on it and made measurements to see if any of the carbon dioxide in the air was transferred into the dirt. This experiment did not show any signs of photosynthesis in Mars\u2019 dirt.\nThe lander had two other experiments that looked for evidence of organisms growing in the dirt on Mars. One used carbon dioxide gas and another one used sugar and amino acid molecules that life-forms on Earth like to eat.\nThe combination of these three experiments and other measurements led most scientists to agree that there probably is not life on the surface of Mars, at least life that does something like photosynthesis or eats sugar. But we still don\u2019t know if there are signs of ancient life-forms on Mars, or even current life deep below the surface.\nThe Viking lander experiments were the most direct tests for life on other planets. In terms of a game of hide-and-seek, though, these experiments were basically like looking in the closet: It\u2019s a pretty obvious hiding spot, but you should check there just in case. Even so, it took scientists a long time to interpret the results.\n\nLooking far away\nLooking for life outside the solar system is even harder and requires different techniques.\nThe closest exoplanet \u2013 a planet orbiting a star that is not our Sun \u2013 is Proxima Centauri b, and it\u2019s about 25 million, million miles (that\u2019s 25 followed by 12 zeros) away from Earth. These distant worlds are so far away that scientists are not going to send landers to do experiments on them for a long time. \nLooking for life on exoplanets is kind of like trying to play hide-and-seek in your neighbor\u2019s house, but you only get to look through the windows and can\u2019t go inside. You might get lucky and get just the right angle to spot someone hiding, but you can\u2019t know all the spots you\u2019re not able to see.\nTools like the new James Webb Space Telescope can reveal the size of exoplanets, how close they are to their stars, and maybe the gases in their atmospheres. But that\u2019s it. How would you look for life with that?\n\nAstronomers have thought about looking for life on exoplanets by looking for oxygen. They started with this strategy because on Earth, life-forms made most of the oxygen in our atmosphere. Maybe oxygen on another planet was made by alien life.\nWe\u2019ve learned, though, that there are other ways to make oxygen that don\u2019t involve life. So now, astronomers don\u2019t look for just oxygen \u2013 instead they\u2019re on the hunt for a planet that has oxygen along with water and other gases, like methane and carbon dioxide. Together, these combinations might indicate life because we don\u2019t think planets without life would have them. But we\u2019re still uncertain about that, too!\nLooking for life by looking for these gases is kind of like looking behind the couch in our hide-and-seek game. Do we know anyone is going to be there? No. But we only get to look through the windows, and we can imagine people hiding behind couches. We might as well try \u2013 where else would we even look?\nWhat game are we playing?\nThere are two big differences between playing hide-and-seek and looking for aliens.\nFirst, when you\u2019re playing hide-and-seek, you usually know that you\u2019re playing with someone else. We have no idea if there are aliens out there to find! It\u2019s possible there\u2019s no other life out there, and it\u2019s possible there are aliens right next door. Until we find examples of life besides our own, we won\u2019t know how common life is in the universe.\n\nThe second difference is that most scientists don\u2019t think alien life is hiding from us; it\u2019s just that we haven\u2019t spotted it yet. There are some ideas that more advanced civilizations might avoid being detected, but researchers don\u2019t think that\u2019s happening in our solar system.\nMost astronomers and astrobiologists know that if we only look for life that\u2019s like Earth life, we might miss the signs of aliens that are really different. But honestly, we\u2019ve never detected aliens before, so it\u2019s hard to know where to start. When you don\u2019t know what to do, starting somewhere is usually better than nowhere.\nLooking for life using experiments like the Viking lander or searching for oxygen might not help. But we might get lucky. And even if we\u2019re not, we\u2019ll get to cross a couple of obvious possibilities off the list. Then we can focus on the harder question of imagining something we\u2019ve never thought of before.\n\nHello, curious kids! Do you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer?

Something new? Political gamesmanship? Something more serious? \nAs a legal scholar who has studied judicial history, politics and ethics, my answer to each of these questions is \u201cyes.\u201d\nOn the one hand, accusing a Supreme Court justice of ethical misconduct is not new. In 1804, Justice Samuel Chase was impeached by the House of Representatives, but acquitted by the Senate, for violating his oath to act \u201cfaithfully and impartially\u201d in several cases, including one where he announced his legal opinion before the defendant was heard, and another, where he delivered \u201can intemperate and political harangue.\u201d  \n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, such accusations were rarer then. They have since become more common, for five reasons: \n1. Ethical sensibilities have changed\nSome judicial conduct, acceptable then, is unethical now. Although out of bounds today, Supreme Court justices used to hear appeals from cases they decided as trial judges, and run for political office without resigning from the court first. \n2. Judges\u2019 impartiality is no longer assumed\n\nIn the 18th century, eminent British jurist William Blackstone wrote that \u201cthe law will not suppose a possibility of bias or favour in a judge.\u201d Impartiality was simply assumed. Federal law later required judges and justices to disqualify themselves for specific conflicts of interest, such as when they had a financial interest in a case or a close relative was a party. But well into the 20th century, judges could not otherwise be disqualified for personal bias.\nIn the 1930s, though, legal realism emerged as a school of thought, first in law schools and eventually spreading to the public at large. It proceeded from the premise that judges were not automatons impervious to outside influences, but were human beings, subject to the same biases as the rest of us. Bias and conflicts of interest thus became subjects of heightened concern, warranting greater scrutiny and regulation.\n3. Ethics have become mainstreamed and weaponized\nAs the public became attuned to ideological and other judicial biases, efforts began to better regulate judicial impartiality and ethics. But politicians, pundits and interest groups also found ways to exploit public concerns about ethics to undermine justices whose ideological predispositions they disfavored. \nIn the 1960s, conservatives became increasingly concerned by what they regarded as the liberal bias of the Supreme Court during Chief Justice Earl Warren\u2019s tenure. When Democratic President Lyndon Johnson nominated liberal Associate Justice Abe Fortas to replace Warren in 1968, the Republicans\u2019 sincere interest in policing ethics converged with their partisan interest in changing the ideological direction of the court. At issue were serious allegations that Fortas discussed pending cases with Johnson at illicit private meetings and had accepted improper payments from businesses with cases before the court, which culminated in Fortas withdrawing himself from consideration for promotion to chief justice and later resigning from the court amid new allegations.\nIn 1969, the Democratic Senate majority, with some Republican support, rejected Republican President Richard Nixon\u2019s nomination of Judge Clement Haynsworth to the Supreme Court, following allegations that Haynsworth had ruled in favor of a corporate defendant whose subsidiaries did business with a company in which Haynsworth owned stock. \nAnd in 1970, Republican Representative and future president Gerald Ford proposed to impeach liberal Justice William O. Douglas for ethical improprieties. One was Douglas\u2019 failure to disqualify himself from a libel case after he had sold an article to the publisher who was the defendant. Another was his paid service as the director of a charitable foundation whose founder was involved with Las Vegas casinos that had underworld connections. \n4. Codes of judicial conduct have emerged and proliferated\n\nThe ethical imbroglios encircling the Supreme Court in the 1960s led to the establishment of judicial ethics codes everywhere except, ironically, the Supreme Court. \nIn 1972, the American Bar Association published a Code of Judicial Conduct that was eventually adopted by judiciaries in all 50 states and the lower federal courts. \nJudges are typically introduced to their ethics codes when they ascend the bench. They are updated on their obligations in continuing judicial education programs, encouraged to solicit ethical guidance from committees established for that purpose, and subject to sanctions for misconduct by disciplinary bodies within their judicial systems. \nAn ethics-mindful culture, long entrenched in the lower courts, has been absent from the Supreme Court, which did not adopt its code until November 2023. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s code is weaker than the lower courts\u2019. It does not require justices to take \u201cappropriate action\u201d upon learning that a fellow justice violated the code. It omits the duty to be faithful to the law. It relaxes restrictions on using judicial resources for private purposes and exploiting a justice\u2019s official status for personal gain. And it asserts that the duty to disqualify when impartiality is in doubt is diminished by the need for all nine justices to preside.\n\n5. A growing cult of celebrity surrounds the justices\nSome members of the Supreme Court, including the late justices Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, have embraced a cult of celebrity. They have showcased their ideological predispositions in speeches, articles and professional and personal associations, and are lionized by ideologically aligned groups, which fuels suspicions that they are insufficiently committed to impartial justice. \nSupreme Court ethics concerns are not new but have escalated in the modern era.\nThe problem has been exacerbated by the court\u2019s detractors, who exaggerate allegations of ethical misconduct to score partisan points, and by the justices themselves, who, in the absence of an established culture that internalizes ethical expectations, have been nose-blind to the smell of their own conduct.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Ethics, US Supreme Court, Richard Nixon, Sonia Sotomayor, Conflict of interest, Justice Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Gerald Ford, Brett Kavanaugh, Judicial bias, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel Alito, President Lyndon Johnson, Chief Justice John Roberts, Elena Kagan, Ketanji Brown Jackson, Earl Warren, Amy Coney Barrett, US judiciary, judicial ethics","role":"assistant"}]}

The recognised athletes include Matildas soccer star Mary Fowler, tennis champion Venus Williams and seven other record-breaking and world champion sports stars from across the globe.\nMattel\u2019s Krista Berger said the brand wishes to acknowledge \u201cthe impact of sports in fostering self-confidence, ambition and empowerment among the next generation\u201d. \nBut is this a genuine effort by a corporation to be gender progressive, or is it a marketing ploy that co-opts feminism in the pursuit of profit?\nDolls and \u2018learning\u2019 gender\nDiscussions about Mattel\u2019s revamping of its Barbie range matter, as research has long recognised that \u201cplay\u201d is foundational to children\u2019s development.\nDolls matter in all kinds of ways: they connect us to our younger selves and are transitional objects that provide us with an early sense of comfort and security. \nHowever, doll play has historically been marketed as \u201cfor girls\u201d, while  promoting gendered norms of domesticity and ideals of physical attractiveness. \nFeminists have long raised concerns about the impacts of such stereotypical portrayals \u2013 and especially their potential to socialise children in ways that both highlight and exaggerate gender differences. \nBarbie in particular has often been accused of spreading narrow ideals of femininity, girlhood and womanhood into the lives of young girls. \nDoes this latest range promise something different? Part of answering this question requires us to trace Barbie\u2019s origins.\nA chequered history\nBarbie was originally a West German doll named Bild Lilli, which was crafted for an adult consumer. Ruth Handler\u2019s discovery of this German figurine led to her adaptation for an American marketplace, which included a name change and wardrobe update. \nSignificantly, Barbie was first marketed as a \u201cteenage fashion model\u201d whose anatomically impossible curves and dimensions proved to be a marketing triumph. Ever since, Barbie\u2019s unrealistic body has generated body image and appearance-focused anxieties. The long-term cultural repercussions still resonate today. \nThe doll also communicates a narrow set of beauty ideals that conflate blondness and whiteness with physical attractiveness. In response to growing backlash, Mattel has introduced more \u201cdiverse Barbies\u201d in recent times.\n\nThe founder of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, said there is something uncanny about dolls, in that they mediate between reality and fantasy \u2014 a tension sustained by a fear and wish they could somehow come alive.\nThe question is, does this new range of Barbies modelled on real pioneering athletes fall within the realm of reality or fantasy? Is it a genuine attempt to make Barbie more relatable?\nBroadening and narrowing representation\nOn face value, Mattel\u2019s recent efforts to diversify its range of Barbies through embracing and promoting women\u2019s sporting is positive. After all, women\u2019s visibility in sport is a longstanding problem, plagued by issues of unequal pay, representation and participation. And you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see. \nBut what exactly are we seeing in the new Barbies? While the range promotes diversity in terms of skin colour and abilities, we\u2019re once again confronted with a sameness of bodies. Each of the Barbies conforms to a prescriptive thin ideal and doesn\u2019t convey the athleticism of their likeness. \nFor instance, Venus Williams\u2019s muscularity \u2013 a feature that makes her a powerful tennis player \u2013 is missing in her replica.\n\nA corporate hijacking of feminism\nBy portraying Barbie viz a viz these pioneering women athletes as strong, capable and accomplished, the doll appears to challenge gender stereotypes. \nYet, in popular culture, the contemporary woman is increasingly being represented by notions of autonomy, agency and choice. This sensibility, that women can \u201chave it all\u201d (known as post-feminism) positions women as individually responsible for their own wellbeing, care and liberation. \nWhen taken up by brands that promote this kind of \u201cgirl power\u201d, a new type of corporate feminism is created. The result is a watering down of feminism. Women\u2019s empowerment is reduced to a marketable commodity rather than a genuine engagement with feminist politics. \nThe dolls in Barbie\u2019s new range embody a combination of physical perfection and sporting prowess. As such, they communicate new levels of expectation and standards for young girls to \u201caspire\u201d to.\nRealistic Barbie?\nMattel\u2019s new range suggests the company is willing to go only so far in its efforts to be \u201cinclusive\u201d \u2013 unable to break away from the rigid plastic mould of Barbie\u2019s unrealistic contours.\nEvidence shows that girls who play with a doll with a more realistic body exhibit less body dissatisfaction than those who play with Barbie. Could Barbie be realistic? Could she ever represent the countless women in the world who might be \u201cordinary\u201d, unremarkable and even flawed?\nIf Mattel really wants to join the inclusive revolution, it ought to rethink the rigid ideals that Barbie continues to promote.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Feminism, Barbie dolls, postfeminism, Corporate ethics, Mattel","role":"assistant"}]}

Why two different methods used to calculate the rate at which the universe is expanding don\u2019t produce the same result. Known as the Hubble tension, the enigma suggests that there could be something wrong with the standard model of cosmology used to explain the forces in the universe. \nNow, recent observations using the new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) are shaking up the debate on how close the mystery is to being resolved. \nIn this episode of The Conversation Weekly podcast, two professors of astronomy explain why the Hubble tension matters so much for our understanding of the universe. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February, the Nobel prize-winning physicist Adam Reiss, published a new paper. It said that new observations of far-away stars using the JWST matched those obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope. \nThese stars, called Cepheids, are commonly used in one method of calculating the rate at which the universe is expanding. Known as the local distance ladder, or cosmic distance ladder, this method has been around since observations first made by Edwin Hubble himself in 1929. And it generally produces a rate of expansion of around 73km per second per mega parsec. \nBut a second method, using predictions of the cosmic microwave background radiation left over by the Big Bang, has constantly arrived at a different number for the rate of expansion of the universe: 67km per second per mega parsec. \nReiss said that when the new data confirmed the earlier observations from the Hubble Space Telescope, the gap between the numbers remains unresolved. \u201cWhat remains is the real and exciting possibility that we have misunderstood the universe,\u201d he said.  \nA few months later, however, more data from the JWST, presented by Wendy Freedman, a physicist at the University of Chicago, using observations from a different set of stars, arrived at 69km per second per mega parsec, a number closer to the cosmic microwave background figure of 67. Freedman is excited that the numbers seem to be converging. \n\n\nListen to The Conversation\u2019s podcast series Great Mysteries of Physics for more about the greatest mysteries facing physicists today \u2013 and the radical proposals for solving them. Hosted by Miriam Frankel it features interviews with some of the worlds leading scientists including Sean Carroll, Sabine Hossenfelder and Jim Al-Khalili.\n\nVicent Mart\u00ednez and Bernard Jones are fascinated by the Hubble tension. Jones is an emeritus professor of astronomy at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. Mart\u00ednez, his former student, is now a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at the University of Val\u00e8ncia in Spain. \n\u201cThe fundamental basis of science, what distinguishes science from science fiction, is our ability to verify the information we are getting,\u201d explains Jones. \nThat\u2019s why Martinez says the mystery of the Hubble tension is still driving people to:\n\nResearch and imagine experiments and organise huge projects with the complicated observation of the cosmos in order to understand what\u2019s going on. At the end, this will affect your idea of the whole universe and probably you will need to change some fundamental ingredient of your cosmological model.\n\nMartinez and Jones have just written a book, along with their co-author Virginia Trimble, about moments in history when scientists realised they\u2019d got something very wrong, and had to readjust their way of thinking. Mart\u00ednez thinks this could happen again with the Hubble tension:\n\nIt could happen that, for example, a new theory of gravity could solve the problem of dark energy or dark matter. We have to be open to those ideas.\n\nListen to Bernard Jones and Vicent Mart\u00ednez talk more about the Hubble tension, and how it fits in the wider history of science, on The Conversation Weekly podcast.

One of the most important will be the Net Zero Economy Authority. The proposed laws to create this authority are currently before the Senate.\nInstitutions like this can prove enduring despite Australia\u2019s contested climate politics. While the carbon price introduced in 2012 was repealed, the climate and renewables institutions the Rudd\/Gillard Labor governments created continue to this day.\nYou might ask why we need another one. It\u2019s because getting to net zero is a very big job, as new low-emissions industries come online while high-emissions industries exit. This authority would take the lead on aligning policies between different tiers of government, facilitating investment, helping fossil fuel workers transition to new jobs, and communication.  \nWhat should it look like? We reviewed international best practice in a newly released report for the authority\u2019s predecessor, the Net Zero Economy Agency. Our recent submission suggests Australia\u2019s authority should identify green investment options and co-ordinate, but should not invest itself. It should focus on finding and evaluating new green industrial options. And it should focus not just on helping coal workers change careers, but on the surrounding communities as well. \n\nThe authority should look for green investments but not invest directly\nWe already have a rich landscape of green investment support, including the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, Australian Renewable Energy Agency, the National Reconstruction Fund, and the Powering the Regions Fund, as well as the new Future Made in Australia agenda, and direct government grants and tax credits. \nThere is no need for another funding body. \nWhat the authority can do here is provide insights and a coordination role, using sound investment principles such as cost effectiveness and assessing the likelihood of future financial and economic returns to governments and society. \nIt could help policymakers prioritise actions amid a complex mix of policy objectives, such as low-emissions systems, supply-chain security, jobs, regional development, benefits to First Nations communities, and social equity. \nFind and scrutinise new industrial opportunities\nGovernments globally are turning to green industrial policies to support jobs and growth as well as to decarbonise. The United States, the European Union, and Japan are using green stimulus in the race with China, which dominates many renewable industries.\nAs a mid-sized economy, Australia cannot compete in every sector and segment of the value chains likely to thrive through the energy transition. We have to choose.\nThat\u2019s where the Net Zero Economic Authority comes in. We need a lead agency to coordinate industry strategies, including identifying Australia\u2019s competitive advantages across global value chains.\nGreen industry policies should be understood as a process of discovery and problem solving, not just handing out subsidies. \nFocus on fossil fuel communities\nMany communities have grown up around fossil fuel power stations and industries, including towns in Gippsland in Victoria, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the gas export hub of Gladstone in Queensland. \nTo do its job well, the authority should not be limited to helping workers directly affected by the closure of coal power stations, as the bill indicates. \nJust under 20% of coal mined in Australia is burned here for electricity generation. Almost 50% is exported for coal plants overseas, and metallurgical coal exports for steel-making make up the remainder. In the global transition to net zero, demand for both thermal and metallurgical coal will fall, and with it, Australian export income.\nAt present, the Net Zero Economy Authority Bill relies on planned closures of domestic power stations as the trigger to provide worker transition support via legislated processes. The scope is limited to workers in coal and gas power stations and dependent employers such as supplying coal mines \u2013\u00a0 excluding the vast majority of Australia\u2019s coal workers. It is difficult to see the rationale for this.  \nIt would be better if the authority\u2019s legislated remit included a strong focus on regional prosperity in the transition. That\u2019s because shutting down a major mine has wider effects, including to contractors and regional small businesses. The authority has a sizeable budget allocation for its support functions, which could be used more widely toward broader regional prosperity. \nExtending support out beyond just the affected workers is something we should have learned from the painful shutdown of Australia\u2019s car manufacturing industry. \n\nLearning, participation, monitoring and reporting\nMany other nations have moved to create new institutions to usher in the new economy, for instance Germany\u2019s Coal Commission, Canada\u2019s Just Transition for Canadian Coal Power Workers and Communities, and South Africa\u2019s Presidential Climate Commission. We don\u2019t have to reinvent the wheel \u2013\u00a0we can draw on international experience.  \nFor Australia\u2019s authority to be effective, it will have to excel in policy coordination. Often, state and federal policies may not align directly \u2013\u00a0or may even pull in different directions. \nFor instance, it could play a vital role in coordinating the efforts of NSW\u2019s authority overseeing renewable energy zones, EnergyCo, and the federal green manufacturing and mining agenda, Future Made in Australia. Let\u2019s say you wanted to make green hydrogen. It makes sense to locate federally backed hydrogen plants next to big state-run renewable zones. \nChange can be confronting \u2013\u00a0especially when communities feel it is being imposed on them. To avoid this, the authority must make community participation a central part of its efforts, especially in the regions set to house many of our new green industries and power sources. \nThe final role for the Net Zero Economic Authority could be to monitor, report and evaluate progress. This is essential, given the size of the transition. It can help governments, business and the community understand whether policy interventions are working or if it\u2019s time to rethink. \nTransparency about successes and failures of transition will be essential to build and maintain public trust during a time of fundamental change in parts of Australia\u2019s economy.\nCorrection: This article has been amended to clarify the distinction between the NZEA\u2019s legislated requirements and its broader functions, and to define more precisely the range of employers who will be affected.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Energy, Environment, Decarbonisation, Green investment, Coal power, Energy transition, worker transition, green stimulus, Net zero emissions","role":"assistant"}]}

Costello, who was in Canberra to open Nine\u2019s revamped Parliament House accommodation, said he had not touched Mendes, claiming he had fallen over while walking backwards. \n\u201cAs I walked past him, he walked back into an advertising placard and he fell over. I did not strike him. If he\u2019s upset about that, I\u2019m sorry,\u201d Costello said. Costello made no effort to help Mendes up, or ask if he was all right. \nThe Thursday incident was captured on camera by Mendes.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is believed Costello, who was appointed chairman in 2016 and had a couple of years still to run in his contract, wanted to tough things out. On Thursday night he rejected as \u201crubbish\u201d any suggestion his chairmanship had been placed at risk.\nNine has been mired in a major scandal over revelations of complaints from staff about sexual harassment and toxicity in the workplace, especially for women. A senior news executive at Nine, Darren Wick, recently stepped down after a complaint about his past behaviour. Staff were further angered at reports Wick received a large payout. The scandal has put Nine\u2019s chief executive officer Mike Sneesby under pressure.\nNine\u2019s share price has also been plummeting this year. \nCostello is replaced by the Deputy Chair Catherine West. \nCostello said in a long statement late Sunday: \u201cAfter nearly eleven years on the Board of Nine Entertainment Company (NEC) and more than eight years as Chair, I had flagged retiring from the Board some time after the July Olympics and by the AGM in November at latest.\n\"Last year, the Company retained a Search Firm to identify new Directors. The work is well advanced.\n\"I have today informed the Board of NEC that I will pull forward that timing, stand down as Chair and resign as a Director.\n\"The Deputy Chair Catherine West has been working with the Search Firm and is well placed to Chair the company and conclude the process of refreshing the Board.\n\"The Board has been supportive through the events of the last month and last few days in particular. But going forward I think they need a new Chair to unite them around a fresh vision and someone with the energy to lead to that vision for the next decade.\n\"The new Chair will require full support from all Directors as this is an industry where there is fierce rivalry.\n\"I do not rate the attacks of a commercial rival. The threat to this industry comes externally from Trillion Dollar technology companies that are competing for its business. To stand still or hope to continue to do things as they always have been done is not an option.\u201d\nCostello said Sneesby \u201chas always had my full support as CEO.\n\"The Company has set up a robust process to investigate historical complaints which has my full support.

The image is of a young man brimming with self-assurance who, without warning, is assailed by some irreproachable authority. He protests, but his fate is sealed. The verdict is guilty. His sentence is death.\nThat this young man\u2019s sudden misfortune is often foreshadowed by a sudden loss of appetite reflects a persistent theme in Kafka\u2019s work. He is consumed by the problem of finding adequate nourishment.\nYou can find it in The Trial (1925) where Joseph K. notes that his unexpected arrest for an unspecified crime was preceded by the non-arrival of breakfast. \nIt\u2019s in The Judgement (1912) where Georg Bendemann observes that his bullying and domineering father had barely touched his breakfast. Then, after a bitter confrontation, Georg runs to a nearby bridge intending to throw himself off. He grips the rails \u201cas a starving man grasps at food\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd, it\u2019s in his most famous work, The Metamorphosis (1915). \u201cI\u2019ve got appetite enough\u201d, complains the giant bug Gregor Samsa, \u201cbut not for things of that kind\u201d.\n\n\nThis article is part of our series marking 100 years since the death of writer Franz Kafka. These articles explore his legacy and influence on everything from cinema to law. To read more click here\n\nKafka makes the biographical connection obvious. In his diaries (newly translated by Ross Benjamin), Kafka noted that \u201cGeorg\u201d has the same number of letters as \u201cFranz\u201d, and that \u201cBende\u201d (as in \u201cBendemann\u201d) the same consonant and vowel structure as \u201cKafka\u201d. (\u201cSamsa\u201d, we might add, indulges in the same wordplay).\nThe connection between good health and good nourishment also dominated Kafka\u2019s thoughts long before tuberculosis swelled his throat to make eating practically impossible. To ease the migraines, insomnia and other ailments which stifled his creativity, Kafka cut meat from his diet and consumed, like Gregor Samsa, vast quantities of unpasteurised milk.\nBut the problem of appetite could also be pathological.\nOf the self-doubts which periodically plagued Kafka\u2019s creativity, he wryly noted that, like a dog, he could be content to \u201cleap out when he is given food and to leap back when he has devoured it.\u201d Just six months earlier, he wrote a letter to his friend composer Max Brod detailing a violent fantasy: \u201cI lie stretched out on the floor, sliced up like a roast, and with my hand am slowly pushing a slice of the meat toward a dog in the corner.\u201d\nIn a word, Kafka preferred death to obedience. He preferred the idea of being consumed than of blindly consuming what life had served up. (Lurking in the background, always, was the brutish and domineering father he could not satisfy, nor separate from).\n\nIt is perhaps fitting then, that one of his final stories is about the refusal of all sustenance.\nIn A Hunger Artist (1922), a man fasts in a cage for 40 days to entertain crowds of eager onlookers. To ensure he doesn\u2019t cheat, public representatives (usually butchers) watch him day and night. However, as the audience\u2019s appetite for pleasure changes, his popularity wanes. \nThe hunger artist ends up at a circus pushed to the side of a thoroughfare (en route to the animals), little observed. After countless days fasting, an overseer discovers him on the brink of death. \n\u201cI have to fast,\u201d he whispers, \u201cbecause I could never find the nourishment I liked. Had I found it, believe me, I would never have caused any stir, and would have eaten my fill just like you and everyone else.\u201d After his death, the hunger artist is unceremoniously buried. In what was his cage, a rapacious panther now proudly stands. The crowds return.\n\nAmong Kafka\u2019s letters, his friend the American lung surgeon Robert Klopstock recounted that around the time Kafka was finishing the proofs of this final collection, he was literally starving to death. Moved by the \u201ctremendous psychological effort and a shattering intellectual reencounter with himself,\u201d observed Klopstock, \u201ctears rolled down his cheeks for a long time\u201d \u2013 a rare expression of emotion from a writer who \u201chad always shown a superhuman self-control\u201d.\nIn Kafka, it is often what we refuse, and what we refuse to share, that reveals us. \u201cThe power to say no,\u201d he noted in his diary, is the \u201cmost natural expression of the perpetually changing, renewing, dying reviving human fighting organism\u201d and it \u201cis something we always have\u201d. In Kafka\u2019s writing, we are defined by what we find the courage to say \u201cno\u201d to, it is an expression of the demand for better nourishment.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Literature, Reading, Franz Kafka, Give me perspective, Kafka 100","role":"assistant"}]}

After a terrible few weeks of election campaigning, the Tories are on 18% while Reform has edged ahead to 19%. The same poll gave Labour 37% and the Liberal Democrats 14%. \nThis news makes a great headline, but it actually means the Conservatives and Reform are essentially neck-and-neck in the polls. This is because all surveys are subject to errors, which are commonly plus or minus 3% in a typical poll. \nThis happens because even a well-conducted, probability-based survey can produce results which differ from a census of all voters. If Reform hits 21% in voting intentions and the Tories remain on 18%, statistical theory shows there is a 95% chance that Nigel Farage\u2019s party would actually be ahead in the country.\nNevertheless, it is clear that Farage\u2019s surprise takeover as the new Reform leader, and his decision to stand as a candidate in Clacton, has boosted support for the party. Farage was helped by Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to leave the D-Day celebrations early, which gave him the opportunity to attack the prime minister for a lack of patriotism.\nThe fact that Reform has now overtaken the Conservatives in at least one poll raises the question of whether the party can beat them in the forthcoming general election. It is very unlikely to do that in terms of seats in the House of Commons \u2013 but it might be possible when it comes to vote shares.\nAn important thing to remember is that Reform, in its previous incarnation as the Brexit party, has already beaten the Tories in a national election in Britain. This was in the May 2019 European Parliamentary elections which are now largely forgotten. They actually temporarily destroyed the British party system. \nThe Brexit party came first with 29 seats in the European parliament, followed by the Liberal Democrats with 16. Labour won 10 and the Conservatives four. Such was the collapse in Conservative support that the Greens won three more seats than the Tories.\nThis was at the height of the turmoil over Brexit and Theresa May\u2019s failure to get the House of Commons to agree a deal with Brussels. When my colleagues and I analysed that election in our book Brexit Britain, we concluded that: \u201cThe public mood was very sour and many voters \u2013 leavers and remainers alike \u2013 were inclined to give the major parties a \u2018good kicking\u2019.\u201d\nThere are, of course, significant differences between the European elections and general elections. Turnout was always lower in the former, and the 2019 European elections were heavily focused on Brexit \u2013 in contrast, polls reveal it is now the most important issue for only 13% of the population. Brexit has faded considerably as an issue.\nHowever, we can all recognise that the public mood is again very sour, and that the inclination to \u201cgive the major parties a good kicking\u201d hangs heavy in the air.\n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts? Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we\u2019ll fact check the claims being made.Sign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nThe survey analysis we conducted during the European elections showed the Brexit party did well among older voters, the relatively uneducated, those on low incomes, men and working-class voters. They were strongly in favour of leaving the EU; they liked Farage and disliked Jeremy Corbyn and May. Many of them identified with the Brexit party, even though it was a very new political brand (having only been founded in 2018). \nBrexit supporters were also rather anti-establishment, opposing excessive inequality in Britain and disliking large corporations.\nThe YouGov poll on 2024 vote intentions shows that Reform voters have very similar characteristics to Brexit party voters in 2019. There was no support for Reform among 18- to 24-year-olds in the survey, for example \u2013 only older voters. And support for Reform is significantly higher among working-class people than middle-class people.\nThe most important point about support for Reform in the 2024 election is what it will do to the Conservative vote. Unfortunately, data from the 2019 election is no use to us here, because Farage stood down Reform candidates in Conservative constituencies to give the incumbent MPs who supported Brexit a clear run. Reform ended up fielding only 275 candidates across the country, so we aren\u2019t able to use the 2019 results as a model for what might happen this year.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Election 2024: how many seats every party in Westminster is defending \u2013 and what they are aiming for on July 4\n\n\n\n\nWe can, however, look at Ukip\u2019s performance in the 2017 general election. Ukip still exists as a party but its leadership, candidates and voters overwhelmingly moved to the Brexit party when it was founded in 2018, and subsequently to Reform. This happened in such large numbers that Ukip can effectively be considered an earlier iteration of Reform.\nIn 2017, Ukip fielded 378 candidates \u2013 close to 60% of Westminster parliamentary seats. The chart shows the relationship between the Conservative and Ukip vote shares in those seats.   \nConservative and Ukip vote shares, 2017 UK election:\n\nEach dot in the chart is a constituency and the summary line measures the relationship between the vote shares of the two parties in similar constituencies. This is not the same as fitting a summary line to all constituencies, but instead captures how the relationship changed as Ukip won more support across the country.\nThis reveals something very interesting \u2013 namely, that the Conservative and Ukip vote shares rose together when Ukip support remained under about 4%. In effect, the Conservatives and Ukip were allies in these constituencies, with both gaining votes from the other parties.\nBut the picture changed rather dramatically when Ukip began to win above that 4% threshold. Then, the parties became rivals, with Ukip making gains at the expense of the Conservatives.\n\nThe explanation for this relates to support for leave voting in the 2016 EU referendum. Leave voting was only modestly correlated with Conservative voting in 2017 (0.30), whereas it was very strongly correlated with Ukip voting (0.69). This means that many voters in the constituencies strongly favouring leave were more likely to put their trust in Ukip and Farage than the Conservatives and May to get the job done.\nIf Reform voters in the current election behave like Ukip voters in 2017, then the surge in support for the party will make it a strong rival to the Conservatives in practically every constituency it fights. \nIt is true that Brexit is no longer the salient issue it was back then, and that there is a lot of \u201cBregret\u201d among voters at the present time. But a YouGov survey conducted last year showed around a third of the electorate continues to support Brexit. Coupled with the dive in support for the government, it is easy to see how disgruntled Conservative leave supporters might easily change their vote to Reform. \nIronically, this will help to deliver victories for both Labour and the Liberal Democrats in many of the seats being contested.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"UK politics, Nigel Farage, Polling, Rishi Sunak, Reform UK, Election 2024, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

In an interview with Time magazine, published on April 30 2024, Trump referred to migrants as \u201ccriminals\u201d, who \u201ccome in and they steal our jobs, and steal our wealth, and they steal our country\u201d. Trump was especially disparaging towards migrants from China, who he said are a \u201cmajor force that\u2019s forming in our country\u201d. In short, according to Trump, undocumented migration is \u201can invasion of our country\u201d.\nTrump\u2019s recent anti-migrant rhetoric is particularly inflammatory, but it is not new. It has been Trump\u2019s calling card since he entered the political fray. For example, in his first speech announcing his candidacy for the 2016 presidency, Trump infamously referred to Mexicans migrants saying, they are \u201cbringing drugs, they are bringing crime and they are rapists\u201d. Why does Trump use this kind of negative rhetoric to refer to migrants? Because it works as an electoral strategy. It has been especially successful in cultivating support from Trump\u2019s core voting base: white, working-class Americans.\nA recent aggregate analysis of leading polls shows Trump 13.7 percentage points ahead of Biden among white voters. This electoral advantage is even greater among white Americans without college degrees, among whom 60% prefer Trump. So, while many observers have noted Trump\u2019s recent gains with black and Hispanic voters as a key dynamic to watch in the 2024 election, his support remains firmly rooted in white America.\nHow has a billionaire from New York City managed to cultivate such strong support among working-class Americans? This has been a question many have asked since Trump\u2019s win in 2016. In response, most have pointed to his populist style and his ability to tap into the grievances of those who fear a perceived growth in \u201cwoke\u201d politics, or who see themselves as left behind by globalisation. Our take is slightly different.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur in-depth research on Trump\u2019s 2016 and 2020 campaigns shows that Trump\u2019s support stems from his ability to tap into an \u201cethno-nationalist\u201d tradition of American identity in his campaign rhetoric. This tradition of American identity is based on a set of criteria (including being white, Christian, native-born, and English-speaking) to define who is a \u201creal\u201d American, and who is not. Trump uses this vision of American identity to garner support from white Americans by campaigning on the idea that he will defend them from the threat posed by people who are not perceived as real Americans \u2013 particularly the ostensible threat posed by undocumented migrants.\nTrump\u2019s shifting support\nHow does our argument that Trump\u2019s support is based on an ethno-nationalist ideology that speaks to white Americans square with the fact he has recently been growing his support among people of colour \u2013 the so-called racial realignment in US politics?\nWhile seemingly paradoxical, Trump\u2019s messaging could also explain why he is gaining support from some Latino and Hispanic Americans. As others have shown, Trump\u2019s support among people of colour is not proof that race doesn\u2019t matter in America \u2013 quite the opposite. People of colour who support Trump tend to have conservative views on race and migration.. Trump\u2019s recent doubling down on anti-migrant messaging picks up and reinforces these views. He is speaking to both his white voting base and a minority of people of colour who hold conservative views about migration and racial problems in the US. This helps understand how he is cultivating support from ethnic minorities because of \u2013 not in spite of \u2013 his messaging.\n\nInterestingly, even though ethno-nationalism is central to Trump\u2019s campaign rhetoric, he tends to avoid explicitly referring to it. Presumably this tactic reflects a desire to continue to build his support among people of colour as well as white Americans, while also avoiding charges of outright racism. For example, he rarely defends white Americans directly, although there are indications that he is increasingly willing to do so) \u2013 for example, at a rally in Arizona in 2022, he claimed that \u201cwhite people\u201d were being \u201cdenigrated\u201d and discriminated against  when they tried to seek \u201clife-saving therapeutics\u201d.\nInstead, Trump tends to heavily rely upon thinly veiled speech codes known as \u201cdog whistles\u201d to implicitly refer to them. This is what he is doing when he says he is standing up for the \u201csilent majority\u201d and \u201cforgotten men and women\u201d, or when he claims he will protect \u201csuburban housewives\u201d from the threat of illegal migrants. The examples of Trump invoking these messages are countless now \u2013 we all know what he says, how he says it, and who he is taking about.\nBut why is Trump\u2019s use of this type of rhetoric so effective at winning support? In short, it is because it is not new. There is a long tradition of ethno-nationalism in American politics, as we discuss in our recent book. The idea at the heart of the founding documents of the US, such as the Bill of Rights \u2013 which outlines how all Americans should have equal rights regardless of their ethnic, racial, or religious backgrounds \u2013 has long been countered by the idea that America is first and foremost a white, Christian nation. \nThis alternative conception of America has periodically gained force among white Americans during times of heightened anxiety over their perceived loss of status, for example in relation to the emancipation of formerly enslaved black Americans or \u2013 as we are seeing today \u2013 in response to migration. Trump draws directly on this long tradition, while also adapting it so that it resonates with contemporary anxieties. Trump may be the most successful defender of this tradition of American identity in recent memory, but he is not the first.\nBut, as much as Trump\u2019s campaign strategy has been remarkably effective in building his base, it is also inherently limiting. This is because many Americans \u2013 including many white Americans \u2013 reject this tradition of American identity in favour of a more inclusive one which is more closely aligned with the founding documents. This tradition underpinned Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign. This is the \u201csoul of the nation\u201d Biden says he is trying to save. \nSeen from this perspective \u2013 in which the two presumed candidates are drawing on diametrically opposed visions of American national identity \u2013 it is not surprising that Trump has not been able to meaningfully increase his support. And here Trump is faced with a puzzle as he ramps up his 2024 campaign: the very ideology that has enabled him to make a powerful connection with his base is just as powerfully repellent to many other Americans.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Donald Trump, US immigration, China-US, Give me perspective, US election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

The initiative is recognized both federally and in many provinces and celebrates public servants at all levels. It\u2019s aimed at honouring the important work they do and their contribution to government in Canada. \nThroughout the week, political leaders, including the prime minister, issue statements thanking public servants for their dedication. Often, awards for excellence, innovation and long-term service are announced to recognize and profile outstanding achievements among the country\u2019s public sector employees. This year was no exception.\nBut the celebratory nature of the week belies serious tensions in the role of public servants in Canada and how they\u2019re perceived by the public and political leaders.\nCanadian distrust\nWhile trust levels tend to fluctuate, a 2021 report found that less than half (48 per cent) of Canadians surveyed indicated they trusted the public service, which is slightly lower than the average among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development states (50 per cent) and only a little higher than trust in Canadian politicians (44 per cent). \n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health-care workers were subject to threats of violence as they implemented and communicated public health restrictions. In the last few years, high levels of inflation and concerns about affordability in Canada have prompted strident criticism of public servants working in the banking and housing sectors from both the public and politicians.\n\nThe traditional model of the public servant in systems of governments like Canada\u2019s is a non-partisan, career official who can serve governments of different political stripes. These officials are meant to remain largely anonymous and responsible solely to their elected minister as they lend their expertise to elected governments while implementing governments\u2019 decisions and delivering public services. \nThis model relies on impartiality so public servants can be frank and fearless when providing advice and administer program and services free from political influence. \nNew model necessary?\nBut many have argued that the traditional public servant model is no longer tenable or desirable. \nWith citizens\u2019 service expectations increasing, demands for direct input in decision-making and more non-government entities involved in governance, there is a growing school of thought that today\u2019s public servant must be an outward-focused manager who works collaboratively with non-government partners and promotes democracy by engaging directly with citizens. \nMy research asked the public, politicians and public servants themselves what they thought the role of the public servant should be in Canadian democracy. Despite traditional assumptions that bureaucracy is slow to adapt to change and unresponsive to the demands of the public and political leaders, there was significant agreement among all three groups. \nThe public, politicians and public servants supported the principle of non-partisanship and believed that, ultimately, elected ministers should be deemed at fault when something goes wrong in government. A majority of all three groups thought public servants should not be free from public scrutiny and that part of their job was to engage regularly with stakeholders, media and other external groups. \nThe issue is not a disconnect between the expectations of the public and politicians on one hand and public servants\u2019 unwillingness to change on the other. The problem stems from a fundamental tension between non-partisanship and openness and transparency, two values that all groups supported but might be mutually exclusive. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Murky details: Why the federal government must divulge which MPs conspired with foreign powers\n\n\n\n\nImpartiality questioned\nIf public servants increasingly engage directly with the public, civil society organizations and the media, the chances will increase that they\u2019ll get drawn into political debates or even politicized. Their expertise could be viewed as serving a particular political interest rather than the public good.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, chief medical officers of health became household names by providing daily case counts and announcing new measures to address the spread of the virus. This caused confusion about accountability as it was sometimes unclear which decisions were made by public health experts and which were made by politicians.\nIn addition, these officials were subject to partisan criticism and conspiracies.. \nIn these cases the chief medical officers of health were no longer viewed as experts working in the public interest above the political fray. This can affect their ability to do their jobs and achieve the compliance required to make health measures effective.\n\nEvolving model\nSo what\u2019s the way forward for public servants? Is there a model whereby unelected government officials can engage freely outside bureaucratic hierarchies and have public profiles but still be viewed by politicians and the public as impartial? \nTo do so, trust is critical. It\u2019s the capital that public servants must accumulate and the currency they must trade in.\nPublic servants are no longer trusted based solely on their technical expertise. Instead, they must rely on their ability to build relationships, communicate complex and controversial ideas in an authentic way and manage conflict. These skills are increasingly just as important as their ability to design innovative programs, generate evidence and deliver results.\nAs public service institutions and leaders celebrated their achievements last week, the Clerk of Privy Council, John Hannaford, and two deputy clerks stated: \u201cWe all play a fundamental role in upholding the values that are at the core of our identity as public servants and serve to safeguard the trust Canadians place in us.\u201d\nLet\u2019s hope that the individuals, teams and projects that safeguard that trust continue to be recognized so they can showcase the skills and values necessary for public service work \u2014 now and in the future.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Public service, Public servants, COVID-19 pandemic","role":"assistant"}]}

Does it work? Is there evidence of harm? \nWe\u2019re a team of researchers who specialise in evidence-based musculoskeletal health. I (Matt) am a registered chiropractor, Joshua is a registered physiotherapist and Giovanni trained as a physiotherapist. \nHere\u2019s what the evidence says.\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind me, how did this all come about?\nA Melbourne-based chiropractor posted a video on social media in 2018 using a spring-loaded device (known as the Activator) to manipulate the spine of a two-week-old baby suspended upside down by the ankles.\nThe video sparked widespread concerns among the public, medical associations and politicians. It prompted a ban on the procedure in young children. The Victorian health minister commissioned Safer Care Victoria to conduct an independent review of spinal manipulation techniques on children.\nRecently, the Chiropractic Board of Australia reinstated chiropractors\u2019 authorisation to perform spinal manipulation on babies under two years old. But this week, it backflipped, following heavy criticism from medical associations and politicians. \nWhat is spinal manipulation?\nSpinal manipulation is a treatment used by chiropractors and  other health professionals such as doctors, osteopaths and physiotherapists. \nIt is an umbrella term that includes popular \u201cback cracking\u201d techniques. \nIt also includes more gentle forms of treatment, such as massage or joint mobilisations. These involve applying pressure to joints without generating a \u201ccracking\u201d sound.\nDoes spinal manipulation in babies work?\nSeveral international guidelines for health-care professionals recommend spinal manipulation to treat adults with conditions such as back pain and headache as there is an abundance of evidence on the topic. For example, spinal manipulation for back pain is supported by data from nearly 10,000 adults.\nFor children, it\u2019s a different story. Safer Care Victoria\u2019s 2019 review of spinal manipulation found very few studies testing whether this treatment was safe and effective in children. \nStudies were generally small and were of poor quality. Some of those small, poor-quality studies, suggest spinal manipulation provides a very small benefit for back pain, colic and potentially bedwetting  \u2013 some common reasons for parents to take their child to see a chiropractor. But overall, the review found the overall body of evidence was very poor.\n\nHowever, for most other children\u2019s conditions chiropractors treat \u2013 such as headache, asthma, otitis media (a type of ear infection), cerebral palsy, hyperactivity and torticollis (\u201ctwisted neck\u201d) \u2013 there did not appear to be a benefit. \nThe number of studies investigating the effectiveness of spinal manipulation on babies under two years of age was even smaller.\nThere was one high-quality study and two small, poor quality studies. These did not show an appreciable benefit of spinal manipulation on colic, otitis media with effusion (known as glue ear) or twisted neck in babies.\nIs spinal manipulation on babies safe?\nIn terms of safety, most studies in the review found serious complications were extremely rare. The review noted one baby or child dying (a report from Germany in 2001 after spinal manipulation by a physiotherapist). The most common complications were mild in nature such as increased crying and soreness.\nHowever, because studies were very small, they cannot tell us anything about the safety of spinal manipulation in a reliable way. Studies that are designed to properly investigate if a treatment is safe typically include thousands of patients. And these studies have not yet been done.\nWhy do people see chiropractors?\nSafer Care Victoria also conducted surveys with more than 20,000 people living in Australia who had taken their children under 12 years old to a chiropractor in the past ten years. \nNearly three-quarters said that was for treatment of a child aged two years or younger.\nNearly all people surveyed reported a positive experience when they took their child to a chiropractor and reported that their child\u2019s condition improved with chiropractic care. Only a small number of people (0.3%) reported a negative experience, and this was mostly related to cost of treatment, lack of improvement in their child\u2019s condition, excessive use of x-rays, and perceived pressure to avoid medications.\nMany of the respondents had also consulted their GP or maternity\/child health nurse.\nWhat now for spinal manipulation in children?\nAt the request of state and federal ministers, the Chiropractic Board of Australia confirmed that spinal manipulation on babies under two years old will continue to be banned until it discusses the issue further with health ministers.\n\nMany chiropractors believe this is unfair, especially considering the strong consumer support for chiropractic care outlined in the \nSafer Care Victoria report, and the rarity of serious reported harms in children. \nOthers believe that in the absence of evidence of benefit and uncertainty around whether spinal manipulation is safe in children and babies, the precautionary principle should apply and children and babies should not receive spinal manipulation. \nUltimately, high quality research is urgently needed to better understand whether spinal manipulation is beneficial for the range of conditions chiropractors provide it for, and whether the benefit outweighs the extremely small chance of a serious complication. \nThis will help parents make an informed choice about health care for their child.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Safety, Health policy, Chiropractic, Spine, Babies, Health, Patient safety, Baby, Health in the news","role":"assistant"}]}

Despite extensive search efforts, the final location of the aircraft remains unknown. It has become one of aviation\u2019s greatest mysteries. \nOur new research explores the possibility of detecting underwater acoustic signals generated by aircraft crashes, such as MH370\u2019s presumed impact, to provide new insights into its fate.\nFlight MH370 was en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished from radar screens. Official investigations suggest it deviated from its planned route, heading southwest over the Indian Ocean. Despite multinational search efforts, including extensive underwater searches along and near the so-called \u201cseventh arc\u201d (the area determined by last communication between the satellite and the plane), the main wreckage has not been found. \nOnly a few pieces of debris washed ashore on western Indian Ocean islands have been confirmed as belonging to MH370. This has left families of the passengers, search teams and the world grappling with unanswered questions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcoustic analysis\nHydrophones are underwater microphones which capture sound waves and pressure changes in the ocean. Such technology has shown promise in detecting pressure signals from various events, including aircraft crashes. These types of signals can travel thousands of kilometres, making hydrophones a valuable tool for identifying and classifying events in marine environments.\nFor our study, we analysed data from the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization\u2019s (CTBTO) hydroacoustic stations. We focused on data from stations at Cape Leeuwin in Western Australia and Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean. \nBoth locations were operational around the time MH370 is believed to have crashed. These stations are located within tens of minutes\u2019 signal travel time from the seventh arc. CTBTO stations have previously detected distinctive pressure signals from aircraft crashes, as well as earthquakes of various sizes at distances of more than 5,000 kilometres away. \nThe mode of impact dictates the signal\u2019s properties such as duration, frequency range and loudness. By examining these signals, we hoped to identify any potential acoustic evidence of MH370\u2019s crash. \n\nPrevious analysis by scientists at Curtin University and later by us confirmed a signal of an unknown source recorded at Cape Leeuwin station, in the direction of the seventh arc. But it fell outside the time window suggested by the official search. \nOur latest research focused on the official and narrow time window. The analysis identified only one relevant signal in the direction of the seventh arc, recorded at the Cape Leeuwin station. But this signal was not detected at the Diego Garcia station. This raises questions about its origin. We also examined data for signals along MH370\u2019s initial flight path but found no corresponding acoustic signatures.\nWith only a handful number of past aeroplane incidents, our findings are not conclusive. But a 200-tonne aircraft crashing at a speed of 200 metres per second would release the kinetic energy equivalent to a small earthquake. It would be large enough to be recorded by hydrophones thousands of kilometres away.\nGiven the sensitivity of the hydrophones, it\u2019s highly unlikely that a large aircraft impacting the ocean surface wouldn\u2019t leave a detectable pressure signature, particularly on nearby hydrophones. But unfavourable ocean conditions could potentially dampen or obscure such a signal.\nControlled explosions\nTo help resolve the debate about the detectability of the acoustic signal from MH370, a practical approach could be to conduct controlled explosions along the seventh arc, similar to those done for the ARA San Juan submarine. \nOn November 15 2017 the ARA San Juan, operated by the Argentine Navy, went missing during an exercise mission. A few hours later an unusual signal was recorded by CTBTO stations. To help with the search, an air-dropped calibration grenade drop was conducted two weeks later near the last known location. \nThe calibration grenade, which was also recorded at the CTBTO hydroacoustic stations, was similar to the unusual signal that radiated from the submarine implosion. The submarine was found a year later with all 44 crew members lost. \nA similar exercise, using either explosions or airguns of energy levels equivalent to those believed to be associated with MH370, could be conducted along the seventh arc. If the signals from such explosions showed pressure amplitudes similar to the signal of interest, it would support focusing future searches on that signal. If the signals detected at both Cape Leeuwin and Diego Garcia are much stronger than the signal in question, it would require further analysis of the signals from both stations. \nThis could also lead to a reassessment of the data used to determine the seventh arc, considering new scenarios based on updated findings. Additionally, variations in signal strength could provide insights into the conditions affecting the variability, potentially helping to better locate impact areas based on specific terrains and paths.\nSo, while our research does not pinpoint MH370\u2019s exact crash location, it highlights the potential of hydroacoustic technology in solving this aviation mystery. By refining our methods and conducting further experiments, we could provide new insights into MH370\u2019s fate and improve our response to future maritime incidents. \nThe ongoing efforts to locate MH370 not only seek to bring closure to the families affected but also to enhance our ability to track and understand aviation accidents over vast oceanic expanses.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Australia, Oceans, Aviation, Aircraft, Aircraft disaster, Missing aircraft, Flight MH370, Indian Ocean, Sound waves, Aviation disasters, Aviation safety, Hydrophones, Underwater sound waves, Diego Garcia, aeroplane, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

It\u2019s a landmark decision. For the first time an international court or tribunal has laid out the extent of state obligations to mitigate climate change under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \nThese findings are significant because ocean and climate are fundamentally linked. The global ocean covers 72% of Earth\u2019s surface and holds 98% of its water. The advisory opinion cited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2019 finding that the ocean had taken up 90% of the excess heat in the climate system.\nThis ruling is important for Australia, which has sovereign rights over an area of ocean \u2013 its maritime jurisdiction \u2013 almost 50% larger than its land area (excluding Antarctica). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe ruling is vitally important for small island (but large ocean) states that are most threatened by climate change impacts on the oceans. \n\nA matter of survival for some states\nClimate change impacts include ocean warming, coral bleaching, acidification and sea-level rise. These are existential threats for some island nations.\nFor example, Tuvalu in the South Pacific consists of nine low-lying atolls and 101 reef islands. Their combined land area is 26 square kilometres. Crucially, the average height above sea level is less than 3 metres. \nThis vulnerability to rising sea levels is only part of the problem for Tuvalu. The increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change compounds the threat. \nIn 2015 Cyclone Pam created storm waves that displaced 45% of Tuvalu\u2019s people. Loss and damage costs were estimated at US$10 million. That was more than a third of Tuvalu\u2019s GDP at the time.\nIn response to these grave challenges, Antigua, Barbuda and Tuvalu founded the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (COSIS) in October 2021, on the eve of the COP26 UN climate conference. Members now include Palau, Niue, Vanuatu, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, St Kitts and Nevis, and the Bahamas. \n\nTribunal lays out specific obligations\nA key finding was the tribunal\u2019s recognition that greenhouse gas emissions constitute pollution of the marine environment under the convention. \nThe tribunal also determined that parties to the convention have substantive, specific obligations to mitigate the impacts on the oceans resulting from their greenhouse gas emissions. This  applies to both the high seas and maritime areas under a state\u2019s jurisdiction. These measures include laws and regulations to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution due to emissions from:\n\nland-based sources\nvessels flying their flag or under their registry\noffshore activities such as oil and gas extraction. \n\nState parties must also take all measures needed to implement the international standards set by competent international organisations, including the  International Maritime Organization (IMO) and International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\nStates are required to act on the basis of best available science and international rules and standards. The tribunal underscored the relevance of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, with its goal of limiting the global temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, as the main international legal instruments to combat climate change. \nThese obligations are recognised as being ones of conduct (to make all necessary efforts) rather than ones of result (ensuring harm does not occur).  The tribunal made it clear that the standard of due diligence  in relation to meeting these obligations is \u201cstringent\u201d.\nThe advisory opinion noted efforts to fulfil these obligations may vary with the means available to states. It acknowledged the principle of \u201ccommon but differentiated responsibilities\u201d, which has been developed under the climate regime. \nLaw of the sea obligations to assist developing states, especially those vulnerable to climate change, were also highlighted. So too was the requirement to monitor and assess climate impacts and share information.\nThe tribunal emphasised the specific obligation on states to prevent emissions under their control from causing damage to the marine environment of other states. It pointed to specific convention obligations of co-operation and consultation between states or through international organisations. \nThe tribunal recognised the obligation to protect and preserve the marine environment was broad in scope. However, it stressed the specific obligations to protect and preserve rare and fragile ecosystem, the habitats of threatened or endangered species, and living marine resources threatened by climate change impacts.\n\nAdvisory opinions carry weight\nWhile it\u2019s an advisory opinion, the tribunal\u2019s findings are authoritative. \nPrevious advisory opinions have made important contributions to the law.  For example, the tribunal\u2019s decisions on deep-seabed mining and illegal fishing in waters under the jurisdiction of states developed the concept of due diligence as a standard of care under the law of the sea.  \nAn advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice persuaded the UK to resume negotiations with Mauritius over the future return of the Chagos islands. It also enabled the tribunal to resolve a maritime boundary dispute between the Maldives and Mauritius.\nThis week\u2019s advisory opinion underpins efforts by vulnerable developing states, including small island states, which have contributed the least to climate change, to hold the developed world to account. \nUnder the law of the sea, states bear responsibility for failing to comply with obligations to prevent pollution and protect the marine environment. The tribunal has confirmed these obligations apply to climate change and ocean acidification. \nIts advisory opinion could open the door to future litigation of climate change issues related to the oceans, including through the convention\u2019s compulsory dispute resolution mechanisms.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, International law, Tuvalu, Law of the sea, Marine pollution, convention on law of the sea, Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), small island nations","role":"assistant"}]}

In what has been dubbed \u201cone of the biggest shocks in cricket history\u201d, the ICC Men\u2019s T20 World Cup co-hosts USA beat Pakistan in a pulsating game on June 6. With seven runs needed off the last ball of a \u201csuper over\u201d tiebreaker, Pakistan could only manage a single. \nFew saw this coming. Pakistan has significant cricketing pedigree, including winning this tournament in 2009 and finishing runners-up in 2022. Cricket is also hardly a mainstream sport in the US. Indeed, the New York Times suggested that many Americans were \u201coblivious to the magnitude\u201d of the victory.\nBut history suggests perhaps it should be less of surprise. After all, the first ever international cricket match took place in what is now Manhattan, with the US losing a low-scoring game to Canada in September 1844. And when the Philadelphian cricket team visited England in 1897, 1903 and 1908, they were good enough to win 12 matches against first-class counties at a time when English cricket was in its \u201cgolden age\u201d. \nTheir star player, John \u201cBart\u201d King, was among the most innovative bowlers of the era. His baseball-inspired bowling action and express pace proved too much for many hapless English batsmen.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring a tour of Australian cricketers to North America in 1932, sponsors saw great promotional mileage in orchestrating an off-field meeting between the world\u2019s best cricketer at the time, Donald Bradman, and its greatest baseballer, Babe Ruth. The \u201ctwo greatest hitters of the moving ball\u201d apparently hit it off, albeit the incredulous American was heard to ask: \u201cYou mean to tell me sometimes you don\u2019t have to run when you hit the ball?\u201d\n\nBut if US cricket is to kick on following the momentous victory against Pakistan (and its preceding win against Canada), then the US game must move beyond continual negative comparisons with baseball. \nDescribed by American comedian and actor Groucho Marx as \u201ca wonderful cure for insomnia\u201d, is cricket really too ponderous and long winded for American audiences, given that a baseball game takes nearly as long as a T20 match? The 200,000 Americans regularly playing cricket in 400 different leagues would argue that this version of the game is every bit as dynamic and exciting as baseball.\nCricket\u2019s American dream\nThe traditional US diet of American Football, baseball and basketball is a difficult triumvirate to disturb. But the emergence of Major League Cricket (MLC) is at least daring to mount a challenge. \nNow in its second season, MLC has six franchise teams (with more planned) and is already attracting many of the world\u2019s best male cricketers. Australia\u2019s star internationals Pat Cummins, Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell and Steve Smith will all participate in this year\u2019s tournament, which starts on July 5, with fellow countrymen Mitchell Marsh (the current T20 World Cup captain)  and Marcus Stoinis likely to join them. \nThe tournament overlaps with the UK\u2019s still relatively new limited-overs franchise competition The Hundred. And MLC\u2019s ability to draw private investment \u2013 and the higher salaries that will inevitably follow \u2013 means the American short-form game might prove more attractive to top players than the UK tournament. \nWhile this all bodes well for cricket in the US, there are some operational challenges to overcome. The first is whether its administrative infrastructure can recover after the USA Cricket Association was suspended by the International Cricket Council in 2015 because of concerns regarding its \u201cgovernance, finance, reputation and cricketing activities\u201d. The old association had somehow found itself US$4 million (\u00a33.15 million) in debt despite there barely being an established cricket ground in the country at that time. \nThis brings us to the next challenge: the quality of the grounds. However loud the hype and marketing, poor pitches \u2013 the central cut strip the game is played on \u2013 will always be open to heavy cricketing scrutiny. \nMost experts agree that some of the US pitches being used for the World Cup are substandard. Indeed, the playing surface at Nassau County International Cricket Stadium in New York has been described as \u201cbordering on dangerous\u201d after a succession of low-scoring matches.\n\nUltimately, the future of US cricket is all about money. Will there be enough advertising, broadcasting and sponsorship revenue? And will it be used to pay marquee players to play on poor surfaces, or invested in infrastructure, facilities and grassroots development? \nIt seems unlikely that cricket will take long-lasting root in America until the game is played in schools and colleges, and women\u2019s cricket acquires the momentum it has elsewhere. \nMore positively, a women\u2019s MLC is already being discussed, and cricket will make an appearance in the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. These are further significant platforms to expose the game to a wider audience \u2013 but time will tell how far it manages to squeeze itself into the national psyche and a sporting landscape steeped in history, culture and big business principles.  \nFor now, though, team USA can only do what they are doing \u2013 win with style and terrify some cricketing titans into the bargain.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Australia, Sport, Pakistan, Cricket, Canada, American football, Basketball, Baseball, England cricket team, Big Four North American Sports leagues, T20 cricket, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

On this day, he proclaimed, the Commonwealth would eliminate its net debt and \u201cpay off the mortgage\u201d. \nThe problem \u2013 as financial markets were quick to point out \u2013 was that government bonds (used to issue debt) were critical for all lending decisions in the Australian economy. A government that didn\u2019t borrow at all would create different problems. \nAs Costello himself later reflected: \n\nGovernment or sovereign bonds are the lifeblood of the financial system [\u2026] Although their primary purpose is to allow a government to borrow, trading in the bonds establishes the yield curve. It becomes the benchmark for other borrowers \u2013 state governments and institutions as well as the private sector.   The financial markets were unnerved at the prospect that there might be no Australian government securities on issue to underpin and price the debt market.\n\nInstead of ceasing to issue bonds, the Australian government decided to use its surpluses to establish the Future Fund. \nLeveraging debt for green goals\nAlmost 20 years later, Australian financial markets have reached a new milestone. Government debt is now being issued to drive bold action on the environment.  \nThis month, the federal government issued Australia\u2019s first sovereign green bond to back projects supporting the net-zero transition. \n\nThe A$7 billion bond issue was heavily over\u2011subscribed. More than $22 billion in bids came from 105 investor institutions across Australia, Asia, Europe and North America. \nBut it isn\u2019t a new idea. The first green bond was issued by the World Bank in 2008, following interest from Swedish pension funds who wanted to support investments tackling climate change but had struggled to find projects.\nThis then led to a flurry of activity, including the 2009 founding of the Climate Bonds Initiative by Sean Kidney, an Australian expat who has been a driving force behind green bond markets globally.\nAs green bonds gained traction, the International Capital Markets Association established the Green Bond Principles to \u201csupport issuers in financing environmentally sound and sustainable projects that foster a net-zero emissions economy and protect the environment\u201d. \nIn 2023, about A$1.4 trillion of impact bonds were issued globally, including green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds. \nA watershed moment\nSustainable finance is now at a critical juncture. The World Bank says financial markets are transitioning to a more holistic approach to sustainability and disclosure: \n\nThe data and transparency that were the foundations of labelled bonds could become the norm market-wide, providing the insights necessary to understand the true environmental and social impact of investments on people and our planet.\n\nAustralia\u2019s green sovereign bond is not itself that remarkable. Many green sovereign and corporate bonds have already been issued into what is now a fairly mature market. \nBut as sustainable finance moves further into the mainstream, using green treasury bonds to establish a \u201crisk-free rate of return\u201d could help integrate sustainability into all forms of lending. \nThe risk-free rate of return represents what an investor can expect to earn on an investment that theoretically carries zero risk. Government bonds are typically used as a proxy for zero risk, which is then translated by banks into the interest rates that households and businesses pay. \n\nA typical business, for instance, will have an interest rate for borrowing that reflects the risk-free rate, plus a margin that reflects the bank\u2019s assessment of the risk of lending to the business. \nThis is why green treasury bonds are important. They will set the risk-free rate of return that will flow through to all forms of green finance, ultimately making it easier for households and businesses to access finance that can accelerate progress towards a more sustainable economy and society.\nMaking all finance more sustainable\nThere are many further opportunities Australia could leverage in this space.  \nThe government has already used the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator \u2013 which issues long-term social and sustainability bonds \u2013 to provide cheap finance for social and affordable housing projects. \nA similar mechanism could help local governments finance community infrastructure projects, such as sustainably retrofitting municipal swimming pools. Sustainable bonds could be further incorporated into housing finance options to help Australians sustainably retrofit their homes. \nGreen \u201casset-backed securities\u201d are secured by green loans and can be used to finance the development of solar and battery industries at scale. \n\nAnd there are also opportunities to build new nature-related financial markets, supporting farmers to make investments aligned with the government\u2019s Nature Repair Market Act. This would centre on preparing for climate extremes, for example, by investing in water infrastructure.\nTo unlock these and other opportunities, the Australian government needs to move beyond issuing individual green bonds and support the establishment of markets. The Reserve Bank of Australia and Australian Prudential Regulation Authority can help drive regulatory settings to support this. \nIssuing green treasury bonds addresses a major missing piece in the sustainable finance jigsaw. As climate risk is integrated into finance, the real opportunity lies in using a risk-free rate for green bonds to integrate sustainability into all forms of finance.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Sustainability, Finance, Environment, Government bonds, Treasury bonds, Treasury, sovereign bonds, green bonds, Sustainable finance, green finance, ESG, sovereign bond market","role":"assistant"}]}

In bars, in cars, sidewalks, stores, everywhere. There\u2019s no escape. I\u2019m God\u2019s lonely man.\u201d\nThis same quote could be used to describe De Niro\u2019s acting oeuvre. He seems drawn to characters who experience, either through choice or circumstance, a life of loneliness and isolation. \nI recently contributed to The Screen Stars Dictionary, a collection of videos about movie stars that captures their characteristics through a specific dictionary definition. My choice? Robert De Niro and the word \u201calone\u201d. \nHere are six examples (among many) in which De Niro\u2019s roles embody a sense of isolation, alienation or loneliness, both visually and thematically.   \n\n\n\n\n\nTaxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1982)\nAlienation is a driving force in both of these early collaborations between De Niro and director Martin Scorsese about desolate men in New York City. Taxi Driver deals with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, insomnia and a simultaneous desire and inability to forge meaningful relationships. The King of Comedy, meanwhile, is a narcissistic odyssey about comedic stardom. \nDe Niro\u2019s characters in these films, Travis Bickle and Rupert Pupkin, have often been compared. They can be considered metaphorical siblings, an idea that seems intentionally emphasised through cinematography and editing styles in both films.\n\nPaul Schrader, who wrote the script for Taxi Driver, has discussed his specific style of \u201cmonocular vision\u201d within the film, meaning that the central protagonist is present in almost every scene. This technique enables the audience to build empathy with a character, whether or not it is deserved.\nTodd Philip\u2019s film Joker (2019), also featuring De Niro, and more recently Richard Gadd\u2019s Netflix series Baby Reindeer (2024) use similar techniques, merging themes of loneliness, anxiety and a desire for acceptance. They both follow the blueprints that De Niro put forward in these early, closely linked roles.     \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Baby Reindeer: how the Netflix TV show brings a fresh perspective to male sexual victimisation\n\n\n\n\nRaging Bull (1980)\nThose themes of extreme isolation, performance and even stand-up comedy come together again in another De Niro and Scorsese collaboration \u2013 Raging Bull. The film is a sports biography of the legendary middleweight boxer, Jake LaMotta. \nRaging Bull charts how LaMotta\u2019s success came at the extreme price of estrangement from his family and friends. His obsession with dominating in the ring spilled out as toxic behaviour in his domestic life, driving every meaningful relationship away. \n\nThe famous opening slow-motion sequence of De Niro warming up in the ring, set to Pietro Mascagni\u2019s opera Cavalleria Rusticana, highlights his alienation from the beginning. Punching and weaving to an imaginary adversary indicates the internal battle within himself, while the demarcating square ring cuts him off from the onlooking crowds. \nTowards the end of the film, this moment is recreated in a less glamorous scene in which the ring is replaced with a dim prison cell. Mascagni\u2019s opera is substituted with the sound of LaMotta breaking down, screaming and sobbing as he punches the wall. He is desperate for the humanity and companionship that his temper and fists have stripped him of.            \nMary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (1994)\nIn his career of strong, character-driven roles, some may overlook De Niro\u2019s performance as the monster in Kenneth Branagh\u2019s adaptation of Mary Shelly\u2019s gothic novel, Frankenstein. \n\nThe monster is the epitome of wretchedness and loneliness. Branagh\u2019s version, a faithful retelling, depicts Victor Frankenstein\u2019s obsession with creating a living creature from human remains. His dedication to his work drives everyone away from him. And when he finally brings his creature to life, he rejects him because of his appearance. \nThe monster is in turn rejected by all who happen upon it and is left defenceless, unloved and unknowing about the world. Eventually, this fuels the monster\u2019s hatred towards Frankenstein for giving him life without love. Beneath the makeup, De Niro\u2019s practised performance of social alienation comes through, eliciting sympathy but without the need for the monocular style used in his other works.   \nHeat (1995)\n\u201cDon\u2019t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner.\u201d This is the mantra of career criminal Neal McCauley (De Niro\u2019s character in Heat) who adopts isolation as a calculated strength. \nHis discipline and precision make up the impetus of this crime noir, structured around a protagonist who is \u201calone but not lonely\u201d. His self-imposed solitude is often stylistically emphasised either through shades of gelid blue from his ocean-view apartment or stark fluorescent lighting that eventually leads to his demise. Los Angeles is illuminated as a coldly indifferent city that is too busy to notice anyone \u2013 a quality De Niro\u2019s character and performance capitalise on.      \nAwakenings (1990)\nDe Niro was originally cast as John Baskin in Penny Marshall\u2019s Big (1988), a role that eventually went to Tom Hanks as the studio favoured his wide-eyed innocence. However, De Niro went on to play a similar role two years later for Marshall in a different film.  \n\nIn Awakenings he plays Leonard Lowe, a young boy propelled into premature adulthood after suffering encephalitis lethargica (sleeping sickness) as a child and waking from a catatonic state decades later.\nThemes of isolation, detachment and the need for companionship are again emphasised through De Niro\u2019s performance as he tries to catch up with a life that has been taken from him. Just as insomnia plays a significant part in De Niro\u2019s isolation in Taxi Driver, excessive sleep in Awakenings draws out further motifs of seclusion and loneliness in this heartfelt drama.   \n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Film, Loneliness, Acting, Robert De Niro, Movies, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Sexual violence and abuse are significant global health issues. \nIntimate partner violence continues to be a problem in Canada. According to Statistics Canada, of the 117,093 victims of police-reported intimate partner violence in 2022, almost 80 per cent were women and girls. More than half of women in the United States have experienced sexual violence involving physical contact.\nGiven these high rates of sexual abuse, it is imperative that we improve upon what we currently know about violence prevention and intervention strategies.\nSome have suggested there is a connection between abuse of animals and abuse of women. That might not seem immediately obvious, but the way a person treats animals can be an indication of how they are likely to treat women.\n\n\n\n\n\nNotions of masculinity\nPart of the concern revolves around traditional notions of masculinity, which dictate how men are expected to think and act. Considering the link between traditional masculinity and attitudes toward women and animals could provide valuable insights for developing new prevention and intervention strategies for sexual violence against women.\n\nTraditional notions surrounding masculinity are often based on ideas about men being strong, heterosexual and avoiding roles and behaviours seen as feminine. The good news is that these ideas about masculinity are increasingly being challenged and changed. One example is the American Psychological Association\u2019s guidelines for working with boys and men that confront masculine stereotypes. \nIdeas about how men should think and behave often impact how women are perceived and treated. People who adopt traditional masculinities are more likely to support sexist ideas and disagree with gender equality. Research has shown that men who believe in traditional gender roles are more likely to justify and commit violence against women, including sexual violence.\nAbuse of animals\nResearchers have found that people who view animals in a negative way are more likely to support traditional masculinity. A connection has also been established between how men treat animals and how they treat women. This connection reflects underlying similar attitudes toward power, control and empathy. \nResearch has shown there is a specific link between violence against women and violent behaviours towards animals, and specifically pets living in the same home. There is also evidence to suggest that some people who hurt animals likewise act violently toward women and girls. Women who report that their male partners are mistreating their pets are more likely to report being psychologically, physically and sexually assaulted by the same partners. \nThere are not many studies addressing the role traditional masculinity plays in violence against animals or sexual violence against women. However, the general link between violence against women and animals suggests it is important to examine further. \n\nAnimals are often viewed as resources for human use, subjected to exploitation and mistreatment in industries like entertainment. Research indicates men who think of women as objects are more likely to engage in sexual violence. The lack of agency and autonomy afforded in both cases reflects broader systemic inequalities. Recognizing this can be important for many reasons, such as identifying situations of violence. \nImproving prevention strategies\nAcknowledging how attitudes toward animals are intertwined with those toward women can help improve prevention and intervention strategies for sexual violence. Exploring these attitudes could provide meaningful insights about the link between traditional masculinity and violence against animals that can inform our understanding of sexual violence against women. \nWe can also gain greater insight into prevention and intervention strategies by tapping into the wealth of resources available on the link between violence against humans and violence against animals. These include the well-being of pets during relationship breakdowns, animal safekeeping programs for individuals experiencing partner violence, emotional support animals for survivors of violence and integrating understanding about the human-animal bond in service provision for violence survivors.\nExploring violence towards animals and sexual violence toward women might initially seem far-fetched. However, child protection legislation in the United States originated from animal cruelty legislation. Understanding the connection between the abuse of women and animals can make our communities safer and respectful spaces for all.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Domestic violence, Sexual abuse, Masculinity, Domestic abuse, Sexual violence, animal abuse, Toxic masculinity","role":"assistant"}]}

Some of these will require big dams, which can have major negative environmental impacts. Another looming problem with hydropower is that the water cycle is affected by climate change. Water availability will be reduced and become more variable in some locations in the next decades.\nWe are a team of environmental and energy systems researchers. Energy systems is the study of how energy can be produced to meet the demand of the different sectors of society. Environmental systems modelling is used to simulate the natural environment and evaluate the impacts of infrastructure on it.\nWe analysed the likely development of energy systems in Africa from 2020 to 2050, looking at energy demand, the changing use of land and its impact on energy and how the warming climate will affect water availability. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Climate change will affect hydropower -- African countries must be prepared\n\n\n\n\nThe continent of Africa still uses 80% less electricity than the global average per capita. But given the projected population growth and increase in living standards, electricity demand in Africa will rise. This means new power generation infrastructure will be needed.\nOur research found that wind and solar projects will be more cost effective than hydropower by 2030. This means that only 40% to 68% of the planned hydropower capacity in Africa will be economically attractive. \nWhat also needs to be considered is that reducing the impact of droughts on energy systems requires overbuilding infrastructure. This means more energy infrastructure than needed on average is required to be reliable against extreme droughts. An overall increased annual investment in new power plants (of any type) of 1.8% to 4% will be needed across the continent. \nThis additional investment is needed when considering a worst-case scenario for hydropower generation. This scenario also includes the effects of climate change and the reduced cost of renewables on the power system expansion.\nHydropower no longer the solution\nHydropower is currently the main source of renewable electricity on the African continent with around 40GW of capacity installed. This generates around 150 TWh of electricity in a year, 15% of the total electricity consumption in the continent. This is enough to satisfy the annual power consumption of two countries of the size of Morocco and Algeria with a total population of 82.5 million people, for example. It has been considered a cheap source of electricity with a low carbon footprint. But this is no longer strictly true. \nHydropower presents the following problems.\nRenewable power sources such as solar and wind power are becoming increasingly cost-competitive. These can reduce hydropower reliance, diversify countries\u2019 energy portfolios, and reduce the environmental impact of building more hydropower dams.\nAfrican river basins support land and freshwater ecosystems that are global biodiversity hotspots. Of the 543 major rivers in the world \u2013 those that are longer than 500km and which flow in an uninterrupted way to the sea \u2013 156 (29%) are located in Africa. Dams disturb this by breaking up the flow of rivers. \nIn Africa, 26% of rivers have been fragmented or broken up \u2013 much lower than the global average of 43%. This means that African rivers are valuable hubs of connected river habitats. If all the planned African hydropower projects were built, we estimate that average river fragmentation could rise to 42%, potentially leading to large biodiversity loss. \n\nFor example, researchers found that the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam would result in the displacement of 122,000 people, release seven million\ntonnes of carbon dioxide, and alter the Blue Nile\u2019s water temperature, making it unsuitable for many of the plants and animals living there. \nWhenever a new dam is built, water submerges land. The soil and other matter found on the land (biomass) is digested under the water and this process releases into the atmosphere carbon dioxide and methane, a potent greenhouse gas. These emissions are released from the dams for years after they are first built.\nHydropower emissions would increase by almost 25 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year at least for a few decades, substantially hindering progress towards net zero emissions. This would be equivalent to what is emitted per person over 25 million trans-Atlantic round-trip flights. \nHydropower is vulnerable to climate change: as droughts kick in and water runs out, hydropower won\u2019t be as available or as cost effective. Looking at the whole energy system, our previous research has found that the availability of hydro,  combined with solar and wind power decreasing in cost, means that about 32% to 60% of the proposed hydropower projects are no longer economically competitive. Building new solar and wind renewable systems comes with an overall lower energy system cost than building all proposed hydropower projects. \nFurthermore, our new study shows it\u2019s possible to reduce the impacts of the hydropower projects that are cost-competitive by deploying more renewables. Additional river fragmentation and hydropower emissions can be reduced by at least 50% with a minimal increase in electricity prices (at most +1.4%).\nWhy it matters\nCurrently, energy systems are mostly planned based on engineering and economic considerations. But it is more cost-effective overall if governments plan new energy systems taking into account the available technology, its cost, and costs that would be incurred by projects that damage the environment and communities (such as big dams). \nWe argue that the scope of energy system planning must be expanded so that it takes into account all these factors. Indeed, including social and environmental objectives is key to making sure that the energy transition is clean and just.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      76% of Africa's energy could come from renewable sources by 2040: here's how\n\n\n\n\nThis research finding is very important because hydropower plants continue to be planned in many large river basins, based on the mistaken belief that they are the cheapest form of renewable energy. \nFor the best results in Africa, there will need to be cooperation between different countries. This could help to overcome the regionally unequal distribution of investment costs and potential energy deficits between the different countries.\nAnna Clark, research assistant at the Natural Capital Project, Stanford University, and co-author of the study, co-authored this article.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Solar power, Energy, Dams, Hydropower, solutions, Climate solutions, Hydroelectric dam","role":"assistant"}]}

The \u201corangutan diplomacy\u201d plan was confirmed by the nation\u2019s plantation and commodities minister, Johari Abdul Ghani, at a biodiversity conference in early May.\nMalaysia made the controversial announcement days after the European Union, one of Malaysia\u2019s biggest palm oil importers, agreed to ban agricultural imports that cultivate crops on lands that were deforested after 2020. Firms wishing to export to the EU would now need to provide proof, such as satellite images, that crops were not grown in such conditions. This could hit Malaysia\u2019s palm oil industry, which has been accused of destroying the forest habitats of endangered species, including the orangutan.\nWithout adopting a comprehensive conservation plan for the animals, Malaysia risks international condemnation that it is gifting orangutans as a reward to major palm oil importers. This could undermine the programme as well as the nation\u2019s image.\nIn Malay and Indonesian, orangutan means \u201cperson of the forest\u201d. These great apes are found only in Malaysia and Indonesia. They have reddish fur, long arms, cheek pads, and, just like China\u2019s giant pandas, opposable thumbs. They have human-like intelligence and have been known to employ herbal medicine to heal their wounds, communicate and use sign language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Orangutans can communicate about the past just like humans, new research finds\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, orangutan numbers are dwindling. The WWF (formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature) states that there were more than 230,000 orangutans 100 years ago. But the current population is less than half that figure, and the primates are critically endangered. Undoubtedly, poaching and the illegal animal trade are partly responsible. However, the biggest culprit appears to be palm oil-induced deforestation where swaths of forest land, which contain orangutan habitats, make way for palm oil plantations.\nThe plan to send orangutans to major palm oil importers is already controversial. Stuart Pimm, a conservation ecologist from Duke University in the US, described orangutan diplomacy as \u201cobscene\u201d and \u201crepugnant\u201d, while emphasising that unlike China\u2019s giant pandas, orangutans do not have established state-of-the-art facilities and protected areas in their homeland.\n\nMalaysia is economically dependent on palm oil. Five per cent of the country\u2019s 2022 GDP came from the sector, while palm oil exports are also a major source of Malaysia\u2019s foreign exchange earnings. Palm oil is a highly versatile and cost-effective commodity. It is used to make cooking oil, lipstick, shampoo, detergent, soap, cookies, chocolate and many other everyday products.\nJohari concedes that his idea of Malaysia gifting orangutans to major palm oil importing nations is a diplomatic strategy to convince economic partners that Malaysia is committed to developing its economy while preserving wildlife. Malaysia also clearly wants to try and offset the bad publicity for palm oil and its industrial policy.\nThe history of panda diplomacy\nThe idea for orangutan diplomacy is inspired by the success of China\u2019s panda diplomacy project. Legend has it that panda diplomacy began during the ancient Tang Dynasty (618-907), but only took off after US president Richard and first lady Pat Nixon paid an official visit to China in February 1972. \nTwo months later, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived at the National Zoo in Washington DC. Within a year of their arrival, the pandas attracted more than 1.1. million visitors, and were the zoo\u2019s star attractions for years.\nAs a soft power tool, panda diplomacy has been designed to build alliances with other nations. The programme moved towards becoming a conservation programme in the early 1990s, and Beijing has sent dozens of its bears to key partners across the world.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Panda diplomacy: what China's decision to send bears to the US reveals about its economy\n\n\n\n\nThere are three main elements that make panda diplomacy a success. One, the pandas have visual appeal. Giant pandas have what experts call kindchenschema, a clumsy and childlike set of characteristics that evokes empathy and sense of protection from humans.\nTwo, pandas are exclusively found in China. When foreign citizens see pandas as adorable, friendly and peaceful, they associate them with China exclusively.\nThree, the initiative is tied to a high-profile conservation programme. While people have criticised the political aspects of panda diplomacy, the conservation component has won over critics. According to International Union for Conservation of Nature, giant pandas are no longer endangered, and panda diplomacy has played a crucial role in this.\nCould an orangutan diplomacy programme follow the same path? Orangutans have unique physical attributes and appeal, but there are major points of difference. \nFor one, the Chinese government loans, rather than gifts, pandas to strategic allies, and did not appear to roll out panda diplomacy due to pressure from external factors. More importantly, China has worked closely with conservation groups, such as the WWF, to set up green corridors for pandas, and has won accolades from conservation bodies.\nIn the end, Kuala Lumpur needs to be honest with itself: can orangutan diplomacy reverse the misfortunes that may befall palm oil exports from Malaysia? It\u2019s not likely.\nIf forest management, conservation of wildlife, and the sustainability of palm oil production are concerning trading partners like Europe, then it may best if the Malaysian government addresses these issues before contemplating its own version of animal diplomacy. As it stands, orangutan diplomacy is looking more like a public relations disaster waiting to happen.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"China, Malaysia, giant panda, Orangutan, Palm oil plantations, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Then, in the 2020 election, the state\u2019s voters chose a Democrat again \u2013 Joe Biden.\nWisconsin voters have also vacillated in their support for governors \u2013 selecting Republican Scott Walker in 2010 and 2014 with sizable margins, then voting for Democrat Tony Evers in 2018 and 2022. \nNonpartisan state Supreme Court elections have produced similar results, with a mix of conservative victories in 2017 and 2019, and liberal victories in 2018, 2020 and 2023. \n\n\n\n\n\nRecent polling shows that the race between Trump and Biden is very close in Wisconsin. A win in Wisconsin could be a big step to winning the election for either Biden or Trump.\nI am a scholar of Wisconsin history and politics. Overall, statewide elections for governor, senator and Supreme Court justice have resulted in conservative and liberal victories in almost equal numbers between 2008 and 2022. Understanding Wisconsin\u2019s recent, complicated political history and demographics gives some important context on how it became a key swing state in this year\u2019s election.\n\nA history of Wisconsin\u2019s voting\nIn the early 20th century, the Republican party dominated Wisconsin, winning every statewide election between 1894 and 1930 and controlling large majorities in the Legislature. \nIn the late 1940s, activists began rebuilding the moribund Democratic Party, which drew on two major areas of strength. The first was the industrial lakeshore regions of Milwaukee, Racine and Kenosha counties, where the Democratic prospects were bolstered by labor unions and the strong socialist tradition of the city of Milwaukee. \nDemocratic support for national civil rights laws and nondiscriminatory equal housing laws in the 1960s also made the state\u2019s African Americans reliable Democratic voters. \nThe second major issue driving support for Democrats was Madison, the capital and home of the University of Wisconsin, which by the 1970s became known as one of the most liberal cities in the country. \nAfter years of organizing, Wisconsin Democrats finally broke the Republican monopoly by electing William Proxmire as senator in 1957 \u2013 he was reelected multiple times and served until 1989 \u2013 and Gaylord Nelson as governor in 1958.\nFor the rest of the 20th century, Democrats and Republicans remained evenly matched. Although both parties had support from particular populations \u2013 Republicans were more popular in the suburbs, while Democrats held more sway in larger cities \u2013 both parties campaigned across the state. And rural voters could be swayed by Democratic candidates\u2019 agricultural policies or by Republicans\u2019 appeal to conservative social values.\nA shift in Wisconsin politics\nBy the 1990s, though, Wisconsin\u2019s political geography began to change. Declining factory jobs in the automotive, heavy machinery and farm equipment industries reduced the number of union members, sapping a major source of Democratic strength in the state.\nAt the same time, a shift toward corporate farming in Wisconsin \u2013 meaning large-scale agriculture production traditionally managed by private companies \u2013 reduced the overall number of small and medium-sized family farms. This created a rural state population not directly involved with agriculture and also diminished Democrats\u2019 ability to appeal to nonurban voters. \nRepublicans capitalized on this trend by depicting Democrats as out-of-touch elitists who ignored those who did not live in urban centers such as Madison or Milwaukee. \nAfter Obama\u2019s 2008 election, Republicans rode a backlash against this perceived hostility toward rural and small-town white voters, electing Scott Walker governor in 2010. Republicans also secured a lopsided state legislative majority through partisan redistricting that favored their party. \nThe rural white voter\nTrump\u2019s 2016 campaign appealed to Wisconsin\u2019s rural, overwhelmingly white voters, especially among those without a college degree. \nMitt Romney carried this Wisconsin demographic 52% to Obama\u2019s 47% in 2012; Trump carried it 56% to 38%in 2016.\nIn 62 out of 72 counties, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican vote increased between 2012 and 2016, and the sharpest increase was in rural counties. The \u201creddening\u201d of these counties was instrumental to Trump\u2019s victory, and this trend continued in 2020. \nOn the other hand, the most historically reliable Republican areas became noticeably less Republican. Republican turnout declined significantly in suburban Milwaukee counties, including Ozaukee, Washington and Waukesha. Clearly, suburban voters were more skeptical of Trump than rural voters. \nHeading into the 2024 Biden-Trump rematch, I believe this rural-urban split will likely continue, and the election will certainly be close. Many suburban Republicans remain unenthused about a third Trump candidacy, turned off by his legal woes and the chaos of Jan. 6.\nEconomy a top issue for Wisconsinites\nBiden faces his own headwinds. \nThe most important issue for Wisconsin voters is the economy. A March 2024 poll conducted by Emerson College and political publication The Hill revealed that economic issues, including the costs of health care and housing, were the most important concerns for nearly half of Wisconsin voters. \nConcerns about inflation are a recurring theme, as campaign volunteers have heard when they go door to door. \nThe Biden campaign recognizes unease over the economy as a threat, and the president has made multiple visits to Wisconsin over the past few months promoting his infrastructure plans and the growth in manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin under his administration.\nAbortion and immigration also matter to voters\nIf concerns over the economy boost Trump\u2019s chances in the state, another potent issue provides a significant advantage for Biden. \nApproximately 80% of surveyed Wisconsin voters identified abortion rights as \u201cone of the most\u201d or a \u201csomewhat\u201d important issue for them in May 2024. \nRight now, abortion is legal in Wisconsin until 20 weeks of pregnancy, but there are lawsuits challenging this policy. \nEven some Republicans are uneasy with the fact that the three U.S. Supreme Court justices that Trump appointed were instrumental in overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022. Trump\u2019s continual shifting on abortion has not reassured some local Republican leaders who are worried about a pro-abortion rights surge toward Biden.\nAdditionally, Republican voters, despite the state\u2019s distance from the southern border, express concern about immigration. Although this issue may help motivate Republicans otherwise not enthusiastic about Trump to vote for him, it is unlikely to sway many undecided or independent voters. \n\nA duel to save America\nThe immigration issue is balanced by some Democrats\u2019 concerns about preserving democracy itself and not electing Trump. \nBoth Democrats and Republicans have used apocalyptic language urging Wisconsin voters to \u201csave America,\u201d but Democrats can point to the Jan. 6, 2021, riot and Trump\u2019s ongoing legal problems rather than Republicans\u2019 more abstract concern about border security. \nIn the recent Emerson College survey, 9.5% of Wisconsin respondents listed \u201cthreats to democracy\u201d as the No. 1 issue for voters.\nPro-Palestinian encampments at Wisconsin universities, as well as the police response to the protests, might also undermine Biden\u2019s support among younger, more liberal voters. \nA Biden victory in Wisconsin would require a big turnout in Madison and Milwaukee. But the youth vote in Wisconsin \u2013 as well as elsewhere \u2013 may be diminished out of concerns over the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Gaza Strip, potentially costing Biden reelection. Strong turnout in rural counties, combined with continued anxiety over inflation, could very well make Wisconsin flip back to Trump.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Democratic Party, Republican Party, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, Wisconsin, Swing states, Democratic voters, Republican voters, Joe Biden re-election campaign, Presidential election 2024, Election 2024 presidential","role":"assistant"}]}

Albanese said such matters were for the party organisation. \nLabor traditionally receives the overwhelming majority of Greens preferences. \nIn a follow-up question, Dutton asked whether, given the Greens\u2019 \u201cantisemitic conduct\u201d and the prime minister\u2019s \u201ccondemnation of them\u201d, Albanese would rule out governing with their support. \nAlbanese replied that \u201cwe seek a majority government\u201d and the ALP did not govern in coalition with any other party. \nNational Anti-Corruption Commission decides not to pursue Robodebt officials\nThe National Anti-Corruption Commission (NACC) has decided not to commence a corruption investigation into the behaviour of six public officials involved in the Robodebt scheme, saying it would not add value in the public interest. \nThe NACC had received referrals regarding the six from the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, the NACC said it was \u201cconscious of the impact of the Robodebt Scheme on individuals and the public, the seniority of the officials involved, and the need to ensure that any corruption issue is fully investigated. \n\"However, the conduct of the six public officials in connection with the Robodebt Scheme has already been fully explored by the Robodebt Royal Commission and extensively discussed in its final report. After close consideration of the evidence that was available to the Royal Commission, the Commission has concluded that it is unlikely it would obtain significant new evidence.\u201d \nThe NACC also noted that five of the six officials had been referred to the Australian Public Service Commission. \nA number of current or former officials have been found to have breached the public service\u2019s code of conduct in their behaviour in relation to Robodebt.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Israel, Adam Bandt, Gaza, Mark Dreyfus, Anti-Semitism","role":"assistant"}]}

One possibility is that both major-party candidates end up with 269 electoral votes \u2013 one short of the 270 required to claim victory. Another scenario is that Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who appears to be attracting significant interest from the voters, collects a few electoral votes, preventing Biden or Trump from reaching the magic 270.\nBut then what? In recent decades, election ties have happened all over the country and have been resolved through bizarre, often comical procedures. The common feature of these methods is that the people\u2019s wishes play no part in them. The voters are entirely removed from what is supposed to be a democratic process.\nStrange tiebreakers\nFor instance, a 2006 local school board election in Alaska was decided by a coin toss, reelecting a woman who had actually died on Election Day.\nIn June 2009, candidates Thomas McGuire and Adam Trenk tied in the race for a City Council seat in Cave Creek, Arizona. They each got 660 votes. The town judge pulled a deck of cards from a cowboy hat, shuffled it and asked McGuire and Trenk to draw. McGuire drew the six of hearts. Trenk drew the king of hearts and got the seat on the council.\n\n\n\n\n\nA 2014 city council election in Florida was resolved by a series of steps involving a coin flip and a bag of numbered pingpong balls.\nAnd in January 2018, an official of the Virginia State Board of Elections, adhering to rules set forth in 1705, dipped his hand into a ceramic bowl made by a local artist and drew out one of the two containers in it. The paper inside that container said \u201cDavid Yancey,\u201d indicating that Yancey, a Republican, had won a seat in the Virginia House of Delegates. This was the final resolution of a tied election in which Yancey and Democratic opponent Shelley Simonds each received 11,607 votes.\nOther election ties have been resolved by drawings out of a top hat and a tricorn hat. \nA range of rules\nThe rules for tiebreaking differ from place to place. New Mexico law mandates that a tie should be resolved by a game of chance, such as poker, while Nevada caucus ties call for drawing cards from a deck that has been shuffled at least seven times, with the highest card winning.\nIn research for my 2024 book \u201cMaking Democracy Count: How Mathematics Improves Voting, Electoral Maps, and Representation,\u201d I found that more than half the states have some such lot-drawing or gaming procedure for breaking ties. Some require a runoff election to be held between the tying candidates, while some have the governor or the state board of elections decide the winner. In all cases, the course of action is either random, left to personal or political whims, or starts the election process over from the beginning.\n\nMore than half the votes?\nThis theater of the absurd doesn\u2019t play out only on local stages. One of the most bewildering sets of tiebreaker rules applies to the nation\u2019s biggest election, the one for president of the United States.\nAs initially set out in Article 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the winner of a presidential election must win more than half of the Electoral College votes. But if nobody gets a majority, which at present is 270, the decision goes to the House of Representatives.\nThe nonsense that happens next is manifold. First, according to the 12th Amendment, the House can choose from the top three finishers in the electoral vote count. So the winner does not have to be the winner of the popular vote, or even either of the two people who tied in the initial electoral count.\nThe 435 representatives in the House don\u2019t each get to vote, either. Rather, each state\u2019s delegation as a whole gets one vote. So there are 50 voters, all equal. At this stage, California and Wyoming have the same power, as do each of the other 48 states. Never mind that California has about 66 times more people than Wyoming and 52 times the number of representatives.\nIf a state delegation \u2013 all its representatives combined \u2013 can\u2019t agree or is split down the middle, it loses its vote. The winner must get votes from a majority of states. Any gridlock in the process would have to be resolved by wheeling and dealing among the House members.\nThat\u2019s the process for choosing a president. If nobody gets a majority in the Electoral College, the Senate would elect the vice president, though the rules are slightly different: Each senator gets to vote individually, and they can choose from only the top two recipients of electoral votes for the vice presidency. A simple majority of senators is necessary to declare a winner, according to the 12th Amendment. It\u2019s not clear what would happen if the Senate vote resulted in a tie, though resolving it would also likely involve political scheming. \nThese parallel processes mean that the House could elect a president from one party while the Senate elects the vice president from the other. And if the House can\u2019t agree on a president, but the Senate selects a vice president, then the vice president-elect becomes president until the House decides.\nEnding in a tie\nTies have happened before in presidential elections. The first occurred in 1800. After Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr each received 73 Electoral College votes, the 16 states of the Union voted 36 times to elect one of them but ended in a tie themselves. Jefferson was finally elected president on the 37th vote. Burr became vice president.\nBut Jefferson and Burr had been running mates, not opponents, so the result highlighted a complication in the original Constitution. In 1804, the 12th Amendment was passed to clarify the process of electing the president and vice president, in particular to require separate electoral votes be cast for the two.\nIn 1824, though, the presidential election went to the House again. Andrew Jackson, who ran as a political outsider, won the popular vote and more electoral votes than the other three candidates, though not a majority. After political maneuvering, the House chose the person who had come in second, John Quincy Adams \u2013 an insider Jackson had opposed \u2013 as the president.\n\nA key weakness in US elections\nAll these tiebreaking methods are, in essence, arbitrary. Chance \u2013 not the people \u2013 decides who gets to act as the representative of the people. But the tiebreakers are necessary only because of a key weakness of the way most Americans vote for most offices: Voters cast a ballot for the one person they prefer, and winners are chosen by who gets the most votes.\nThe shortcoming is that voters identify only their top choice, so the process provides no information that could be used to break ties in some informed way. What\u2019s left is dependence on centuries-old traditions, rules and laws that are at best inappropriate for our time and are frequently just plain ridiculous.\nFor presidential elections, abolishing the Electoral College or otherwise amending the methods by which states assign electoral votes wouldn\u2019t help \u2013 because ties in the popular vote could still happen at either the state or national levels. They might be less likely with so many people voting, but they would still be mathematically possible, so any new system would need to incorporate a method for handling ties.\nTo avoid leaving the result to chance, our election systems would need to include a way for voters to provide more information about their preferences than just their top choice. Other voting methods exist that do so. Ranked choice voting, for instance, asks voters to identify not only their top choice but also their second, third and subsequent choices, depending on how many candidates there are. In case of a tie, the rankings beyond the first choice would allow election officials to determine a winner based on the wishes of the electorate \u2013 rather than letting democracy be determined by a deck of cards.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Democracy, Randomness, Election administration, Vote counting, US democracy, 2024 election, 2024 US election","role":"assistant"}]}

From the fifth century C.E. into the seventh century, scribes painted his ancestors\u2019 genealogies into manuscripts and carved them in stone monuments throughout the city.\nAround 650, one particular piece of architectural history appears to have caught his eye.\nCenturies before, village masons built special structures for public ceremonies to view the Sun \u2013 ceremonies that were temporally anchored to the solstices, like the one that will occur June 20, 2024. Building these types of architectural complexes, which archaeologists call \u201cE-Groups,\u201d had largely fallen out of fashion by K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil\u2019s time.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut aiming to realize his ambitious plans for his city, he seems to have found inspiration in these astronomical public spaces, as I\u2019ve written about in my research on ancient Mayan hieroglyphically recorded astronomy. \n\nK\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil\u2019s innovations are a reminder that science changes through discovery or invention \u2013 but also occasionally for personal or political purposes, particularly in the ancient world. \nViewing the horizon\nE-Groups were first constructed in the Mayan region as early as 1000 B.C.E. The site of Ceibal, on the banks of the Pasi\u00f3n River in central Guatemala, is one such example. There, residents built a long, plastered platform bordering the eastern edge of a large plaza. Three structures were arranged along a north-south axis atop this platform, with roofs tall enough to rise above the rainforest floral canopy.\nWithin the center of the plaza, to the west of the platform, they built a radially symmetric pyramid. From there, observers could follow sunrise behind and between the structures on the platform over the course of the year.\nAt one level, the earliest E-Group complexes served very practical purposes. In Preclassic villages where these complexes have been found, like Ceibal, populations of several hundred to a few thousand lived on \u201cmilpa\u201d or \u201cslash-and-burn\u201d farming techniques practices still maintained in pueblos throughout Mesoamerica today. Farmers chop down brush vegetation, then burn it to fertilize the soil. This requires careful attention to the rainy season, which was tracked in ancient times by following the position of the rising Sun at the horizon.\nMost of the sites in the Classic Mayan heartland, however, are located in flat, forested landscapes with few notable features along the horizon. Only a green sea of the floral canopy meets the eye of an observer standing on a tall pyramid.\n\nBy punctuating the horizon, the eastern structures of E-Group complexes could be used to mark the solar extremes. Sunrise behind the northernmost structure of the eastern platform would be observed on the summer solstice. Sunrise behind the southernmost structure marked the winter solstice. The equinoxes could be marked halfway between, when the Sun rose due east.\nScholars are still debating key factors of these complexes, but their religious significance is well attested. Caches of finely worked jade and ritual pottery reflect a cosmology oriented around the four cardinal directions, which may have coordinated with the E-Group\u2019s division of the year.\nFading knowledge\nK\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil\u2019s citizenry, however, would have been less attuned to direct celestial observations than their ancestors. \nBy the seventh century, Mayan political organization had changed significantly. Copan had grown to as many as 25,000 residents, and agricultural technologies also changed to keep up. Cities of the Classic period practiced multiple forms of intensive agriculture that relied on sophisticated water management strategies, buffering the need to meticulously follow the horizon movement of the Sun. \nE-Group complexes continued to be built into the Classic period, but they were no longer oriented to sunrise, and they served political or stylistic purposes rather than celestial views.\nSuch a development, I think, resonates today. People pay attention to the changing of the seasons, and they know when the summer solstice occurs thanks to a calendar app on their phones. But they probably don\u2019t remember the science: how the tilt of the Earth and its path around the Sun make it appear as though the Sun itself travels north or south along the eastern horizon.\nUnited through ritual\nDuring the mid-seventh century, K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil had developed ambitious plans for his city \u2013 and astronomy provided one opportunity to help achieve them.\nHe is known today for his extravagant burial chamber, exemplifying the success he eventually achieved. This tomb is located in the heart of a magnificent structure, fronted by the \u201cHieroglyphic Stairway\u201d: a record of his dynasty\u2019s history that is one of the largest single inscriptions in ancient history.\n\nEying opportunities to transform Copan into a regional power, K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil looked for alliances beyond his local nobility, and he reached out to nearby villages.\nOver the past century, several scholars, including me, have investigated the astronomical component to his plan. It appears that K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil commissioned a set of stone monuments or \u201cstelae,\u201d positioned within the city and in the foothills of the Copan Valley, which tracked the Sun along the horizon.\nLike E-Group complexes, these monuments engaged the public in solar observations. Taken together, the stelae created a countdown to an important calendric event, orchestrated by the Sun.\nBack in the 1920s, archaeologist Sylvanus Morley noted that from Stela 12, to the east of the city, one could witness the Sun set behind Stela 10, on a foothill to the west, twice each year. Half a century later, archaeoastronomer Anthony Aveni recognized that these two sunsets defined 20-day intervals relative to the equinoxes and the zenith passage of the Sun, when shadows of vertical objects disappear. Twenty days is an important interval in the Mayan calendar and corresponds to the length of a \u201cmonth\u201d in the solar year.\nMy own research showed that the dates on several stelae also commemorate some of these 20-day interval events. In addition, they all lead up to a once-every-20-year event called a \u201ckatun end.\u201d\n\nK\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil celebrated this katun end, setting his plans for regional hegemony in motion at Quirigua, a growing, influential city some 30 miles away. A round altar there carries an image of him, commemorating his arrival. The hieroglyphic text tells us that K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil \u201cdanced\u201d at Quirigua, cementing an alliance between the two cities.\nIn other words, K\u2019ahk\u2019 Uti\u2019 Witz\u2019 K\u2019awiil\u2019s \u201csolar stelae\u201d did more than track the Sun. The monuments brought communities together to witness astronomical events for shared cultural and religious experiences, reaching across generations. \nComing together to appreciate the natural cycles that make life on Earth possible is something that \u2013 I hope \u2013 will never fade with fashion.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Astronomy, Cosmology, Archaeology, History of science, Guatemala, Central America, Honduras, Maya, Solstice, Religion and society","role":"assistant"}]}

The newly appointed leader of the Reform UK party has just announced his intention to run to be the MP for the Essex seaside town of Clacton \u2013 the only constituency to have ever elected an MP from Farage\u2019s former party UKIP in a general election. \nFarage announced his candidacy by making a speech from London, in which he lent heavily on the kind of rhetoric that mobilised millions of British people in support of Brexit. Farage has long emphasised immigration and the alleged incapacity of Labour and Tories to stop it. \nHe also made reference to other traditional populist motifs, including excessive taxation and soaring crime, claiming that in modern Britain \u201cyou can go shoplifting and nick up to 200 quid\u2019s worth of kit before anyone is even going to prosecute you\u201d.\nTo bundle together these issues, Farage used the wider theme of national decline.\nThere followed a lengthy tirade about young people not knowing what D-day was, apparently based on a recent poll by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission that found more than half of people aged 18-34 aren\u2019t sure what happened on D-day.\nThis, for Farage, is emblematic of an \u201ceconomic\u201d, \u201csocial\u201d and even \u201cmoral\u201d decline. He harkened back to D-day as a moment of British pride, emphasising how the nation is now far short of that moment.\nHe chose this approach, reflecting on the past rather than the future, because the theme of national decline resonates loudly among people with rightwing inclinations. Research in political science has widely documented that people on the right are more nostalgic about the past than people on the left. It is more common for people on the right to want to go back to the old days \u2013 think for instance of Donald Trump\u2019s famous slogan \u201cMake America great again\u201d.\n\nResearch has shown that the right\u2019s nostalgia for the past has a specific communitarian flavour. It is based on longing for a time when communities were more united, ordered and respectful of traditions. For someone adopting this narrative, it is all too easy to be persuaded that immigration is the root cause of why the community has lost its original cohesion.\nPoliticians who adopt this view can style themselves as the only people who can rescue the country, the only people who truly remember how good things used to be and the only people who understand how bad things have become now. They can then present themselves as the leaders who would have the will and the strength to bridge the chasm between then and now.\nIn his speech, Farage offered himself as the leader of just such a movement \u2013 of citizens who are aware of the decline and who are willing to resist it. In the long run, the call is to unite in the interests of reconstructing Britain as it was in the glory days.\nDifferent world views\nWhile politicians on the right stress decline, research in political science has observed a more future-oriented outlook on the left in many countries, including the UK. Typically, leftwingers are not as fond of the past, but are more optimistic than rightwingers about what society can achieve in the future.\n\n\nWant more general election coverage and analysis from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts?\nSign up for our new, weekly UK politics newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nOverall, then, research suggests that rightwingers and leftwingers view the story of their country very differently. The right views this story as one of decline to be stopped, the left as one of potential for progress that needs to be grasped. Farage and Reform UK have realised that after 14 years in charge of the country, the Tory\u2019s appeal among those who embrace the decline perspective may be waning.\nFarage is in a position to capitalise on the fact that he is not stained by the tumultuous years of Tory government. He is still viewed by many as the man who led the people during one of the greatest political triumphs in recent times \u2013 the vote to leave the European Union in 2016. Farage said in his speech that since that moment \u201csomething has gone very, very wrong\u201d.\nFarage of course poses the most significant threat to the Tories, as his candidacy creates competition on the right. Reform UK could split the vote in some seats and Farage could win his. \nHowever, Farage\u2019s use of the narrative of decline could cause problems for Labour, too. The party is aiming to recapture red wall constituencies where the decline story has significant traction. Farage claimed in his speech that he believes his party \u201cmight just surprise everybody\u201d in this region. \nMore broadly, Farage\u2019s return is likely to polarise the campaign. The threat posed by Reform is already leading the Tories to adopt more extreme positions on issues such as gender identity and climate change, apparently in the hope of assuring voters they are no less radical than Farage. \nWe should, therefore, brace for the battle between the \u201cstop the decline\u201d and the \u201cstruggle for a better future\u201d narratives to ramp up now that Farage has entered the campaign as a candidate. He has, after all, claimed that he intends to lead \u201ca revolt\u201d.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"UK politics, Nostalgia, UKIP, Nigel Farage, Coastal towns, Populism, Essex, British seaside, Reform UK, Seaside towns, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nThe European eel Anguilla anguilla, a sleek, snake-like fish with a fascinating life cycle, once teemed in rivers. But their numbers have plummeted by over 95% since the 1980s. \nBehind this dramatic decline is a combination of threats, including pollution, overfishing, and the fragmentation of rivers by human-made structures like dams and weirs.\nBut our new research has found a simple yet innovative way to help eels get past such obstructions: textured tiles. \nThe European eel is an anadromous fish, meaning that it is born and reproduces in saltwater but lives most of its life in freshwater. These fish are born in the Sargasso Sea, off the eastern coast of the US, and resemble small transparent leaves at this stage. \n\n\n\n\n\nAround two years of age, these tiny eels are transported by ocean currents towards Europe. They then disperse to the Baltic Sea and the Mediterranean. When they reach brackish waters, they move towards the source of freshwater. At this stage, they are weak swimmers and primarily rely on the tides to transport them into rivers by hiding when the tide goes out and appearing when the tide comes in. \n\nAs they grow, they start making their way inland by swimming, climbing and crawling on land. Eels are capable of being out of water for several hours and crawl on land to get around obstacles. Eels in freshwater go through several life stages, from glass eels, to elvers, to yellow eels and finally silver eels with a size of around 80cm. \nAt this stage, they start to undergo changes to prepare them for their voyage back to the Sargasso Sea. This is a 4,000-mile journey that will take them two or more years. Eels only develop their reproductive organs when migrating back to the Sargasso Sea, which is why their reproduction was one of the science\u2019s enduring  mysteries. \nWhen they reach the Sargasso Sea, the eels reproduce and die. Global warming shifting oceanic currents, invasive parasitic species, polluted rivers and illegal over-fishing are some of the reasons for this decline. Another reason is the fragmentation of rivers, which is the disconnection of rivers by human structures. \nFor fish species like salmon, or in eel in this case, that need to migrate up and down rivers throughout their life, these barriers in rivers can prevent them from migrating. This lowers their chances of completing their life cycle. \nIt is thought that there could be as many as 5 million human-made barriers in Europe that disrupt fish movements. Most of them are unidentified, but they mainly consist of dams, weirs, sluices, tidal gates and culverts. \nTextured tiles\nOur research concentrated on finding ways to help eels get past these sorts of obstructions while they swim up rivers as young eels. We found that textured tiles designed to help eels climb up weirs can also be used in situations where the flow is simply too fast for the eels to swim against. \nThe tiles, provided by the Environment Agency, consist of a square base with several cylinders protruding from it. The tiles function in two main ways to help the eels migrate upstream where the flow is too fast and there is no refuge. \nFirst, they provide cover for the eels to rest or crawl by pushing against the cylinders. And second, they slow down the water flow passing through them, above them and to their side. \n\nIn a series of experiments, the eels could swim up our laboratory river more often and using less energy with the tiles present. And the tiles only need to cover a portion of the channel to be effective. This leaves the rest of the channel free for fish species that don\u2019t need them. This solution is not only effective, but also cheap and easy to install in places like culverts and under road crossings, which makes it affordable to reconnect rivers for fish migration. \nThere are many other fish species that struggle to move around rivers because of human obstructions. That is where our latest research is focused. In our latest tests, other fish species are showing promising early results in using the tiles despite being much smaller and slower swimmers. \nThe next steps in transferring this research to the real world is to test these tiles in real rivers to see how different species of fish use them.\nOur goal is to help all affected fish to pass up and down rivers as they require. This would be positive for biodiversity and ecosystem health, as well as improving fish stocks. \n\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read about climate change as much as you\u2019d like?\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

How different today. \nLargely because of an increase in mortgage costs, the percentage of first-time buyers taking out a home loan of between 36 and 40 years has doubled in the last two years, and is more than 400 percentage points higher than in 2008. Across the board, the 36- to 40-year mortgage has risen from roughly 16 in every 100 mortgages to 33 in every 100 over the same period.\nUntil now, long-term fixed-rate mortgages have never caught on in the UK, mainly due to a lack of enthusiasm by banks and building societies. But there has been an increase in 40-year mortgage loans to make purchases of ever more expensive houses affordable.\nAs far back as 2004, a report commissioned by the then-chancellor, Gordon Brown, urged lenders \u201cto provide long-term fixed-rate loans\u201d of more than five years. This report noted the popularity of these loans in the US and much of Europe. \n\n\n\n\n\nToday, a US property buyer can get a 30-year fixed deal at an annual rate of around 6.8%, while a French citizen can access a 25-year loan at about 4.5%.\nThe increasing price of property, both in real terms and in multiples of price-to-average salary, is a major factor. Average house prices are now eight times higher than average earnings, having grown two-and-a-half times faster than salaries (see graph below).\n\nWhere will this trend end? Basic economics says that prices are driven by supply and demand. It is almost impossible to miss the news that housebuilding targets in the UK are not being met, and that supply of new homes is a problem. \nAlso, the demand from buyers shows no signs of easing. So, the millennial children of baby boomers, and the Gen Z-ers that followed them, all have issues that my generation didn\u2019t face. \nIn 2022-23, of the nearly 900,000 \u201crecent\u201d first-time buyers (meaning they had bought within the last three years), 79.6% were between the ages of 25 and 44. Their average mortgage was over \u00a3201,000. But the most striking statistic was that 42% of these mortgages have an end date well beyond age 66.\nWith the increased cost of buying a house coupled with the rising cost of living, it is little surprise that many buyers (not just first-time) are looking to cut costs wherever possible to get on the housing ladder. And for a generation with an enforced 40-year student debt, why would a mortgage of the same length be unpalatable? \nBut cost is only half the story \u2013 the other issue is cash flow.\nCan the borrower afford an extra \u00a3200-300 per month (on a \u00a3250,000 house with a deposit of \u00a350,000) to take on a 25-year mortgage? Or does the saving with a longer-term loan seem irresistible, despite the mortgage being 25-35% more expensive over the full term. \nI bought my first home in 1983 for \u00a318,000 with a \u00a33,000 deposit. At that time, an individual on the average UK salary of \u00a316,000 and a 25-year mortgage had mortgage costs at 34% of monthly income. \n\nThe 30-39 age group have an average salary of \u00a337,544. The take-home salary obviously depends on tax code, student debt and pension contributions. For simplicity\u2019s sake, let\u2019s assume our first-time buyer has a student loan.\nWithout paying into a pension, the take-home pay is \u00a32,469 per month, going down to \u00a32,365 with a pension contribution of 5%, and then \u00a32,261 if 10% goes towards a pension. These figures rise by \u00a376 per month if there is no student loan.\nSo, for a first-time buyer with the minimum 5% invested in their automatically enrolled pension, a 95% mortgage over 25 years is 59% of take-home pay. That\u2019s eye-watering, and that\u2019s when people start thinking about cost savings.\nExtending the mortgage to 40 years saves \u00a3300 per month which will be very appealing to many cash-strapped buyers. Opting out of the pension might be attractive as well \u2013 another saving in the region of \u00a3120 per month. These two simple changes improve the first-time buyer\u2019s monthly available cash flow by about \u00a3500. \nWe still appear to be a society in which many people want to own their own castle, but that\u2019s getting harder, and in lots of cases something has to give. This could be a decision about having mortgages into your 70s, or having less children, investing in savings and pensions. Or it could be a combination of all the above.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Banks, Gen Y, Pensions, Baby boomers, Gordon Brown, Millennials, tuition fees, Gen X, Building Societies, Mortgages, UK house prices, first-time buyer","role":"assistant"}]}

The Conversation Africa asked Iwa Salami, a researcher in regulatory frameworks for crypto-assets, to explain how best Nigeria can manage cryptocurrency.\nWhat is cryptocurrency and how does it work?\nCryptocurrency is a digital representation of a value or of a right. It can be transferred and stored electronically using distributed ledger technology. This is technology that allows multiple parties to share and update a common ledger (record) without relying on a central authority. Records of transactions are called blocks and they make up a blockchain. \nThe origin of cryptocurrency can be traced to 1989 when DigiCash, a company in the Netherlands, launched a digital currency called \u201ceCash\u201d. Although eCash didn\u2019t survive, it influenced blockchain developments. The first and the best known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Another is Ether, used on the Ethereum network. All other cryptocurrencies aside from Bitcoin are called Altcoins and each has unique features.\nCryptocurrencies exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. In theory, they are immune to government interference or manipulation. Cryptography ensures secure online payments without intermediaries. Although intangible, cryptocurrencies hold value based on market demand and adoption. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies can be attributed to:\n\nease of access (compared with cash, foreign currency and traditional financial services through a bank)\nweak currencies (owing to economic stagnation, debt and political instability)\neasy and quick mechanisms to transfer funds\nprivacy in transactions. \n\nIs Nigeria managing cryptocurrency operations well?\nNigeria\u2019s approach to regulating crypto-asset transactions has been unclear and inconsistent. In February 2021 the Central Bank barred financial institutions from these transactions. But in May 2022, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission \u2013 the capital markets regulator \u2013 published a framework for their regulation. This was a sign that it approved of cryptocurrency trading. Then it backtracked in November 2022. In May 2024, the Central Bank banned person-to-person cryptocurrency trading in the naira.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Cryptocurrencies are gaining ground across Africa. That's both good news and bad\n\n\n\n\nHow best can Nigeria manage cryptocurrency?\nNigeria needs a balanced approach to regulation if the industry is to thrive  without harming financial and monetary stability. A stable financial system is capable of allocating resources efficiently and  managing financial risks. The approach must protect consumers and investors.\nIf Nigerians were prevented from trading the naira on cryptocurrency exchanges, they might turn to other assets denominated in US dollars. That would be worse for the naira. \nCryptocurrencies have had a long history of being used in illegal activities like money laundering and the drug trade. But they have not been linked with the devaluation of national currencies, as the Nigerian government has alleged.\nThe first step would be to register whoever is dealing in digital instruments.\nOne of the key concerns raised by Nigerian authorities can be dealt with by tracking the identities and activities of users of crypto-exchanges. The regulatory framework passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2022 provides for this. It requires all regulated exchanges to comply with Know-Your-Customer requirements. Regulators can ask exchanges to disclose the identities of cryptocurrency account (wallet) holders linked with suspicious activities. Blockchain analytics firms like Chainalysis and Elliptic work closely with exchanges and can uncover sinister transactions. \nInternational standards also enable regulators to get information from foreign exchanges providing wallets to their citizens. So, in an ideal world, if regulators adopt international standards for crypto-asset activities these concerns should be addressed. For example, the Financial Stability Board has recommended that regulatory authorities share information on suspicious transactions on foreign cryptocurrency exchanges. If all regulators worldwide adopt international regulation, the outcomes would be consistent. This would address some of the key concerns raised by Nigerian regulators.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Cryptocurrency, NFTs and the metaverse threaten an environmental nightmare \u2013 here\u2019s how to avoid it\n\n\n\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Bitcoin, Nigeria, Cryptocurrency, Naira, Central Bank of Nigeria, Cryptocurrency scams, Cryptocurrency platforms","role":"assistant"}]}

The employee living cost index (which takes into account changes in mortgage interest rates, unlike the consumer price index) has climbed 6.5% over the past 12 months.\nWhy didn\u2019t the Commission do more?\nThe Commission noted that \u201cdiscretionary expenditure\u201d in the retail and hospitality sectors is down. These two industries alone account for one-third of employees on awards.  \nLess spending means less ability of employers to fund pay rises. \nAs well, employers of workers on awards are going to have to find an extra 0.5% of each wage to pay the latest increase in the compulsory superannuation contributions, which comes into effect in July.\nThe Commission also noted low-paid workers will get help from a number of the measures announced in the budget, including the energy bill rebate and an increase in Commonwealth rent assistance.\nThere\u2019s more to come, for some\nIn a year\u2019s time, next July, the Commission has offered hope of extra increases for workers in industries including childcare, where work is largely done by women and has historically been undervalued. \nThe Commission has already received a report on the effect of gender-based occupational segregation and plans to commence work within weeks on determining the size of the increases needed.\nIn line for extra increases are\n\nearly childhood education and care workers\ndisability home-care workers and social and community services workers\ndental assistants\nmedical technicians\npharmacists\npsychologists\nother health professionals (including Aboriginal health workers)\n\nImportantly, the Commission says it\u2019s reviews won\u2019t begin with a \u201cblank slate\u201d.

It affects around 11% of Australia\u2019s wage bill, and it won\u2019t increase it by much. It will lift the minimum hourly wage from $23.23 to $24.10.\nLast year\u2019s bigger increase of 5.75% didn\u2019t flow through to overall wages, which have climbed 4.1% over the year to March, with the rate of increase slowing.\nFor those on low pay, Monday\u2019s decision will be disappointing. The increase of 3.75% won\u2019t be nearly enough.\nBut the Commission has maintained the possibility of modest but permanent increases in the pay and status of some of Australia\u2019s lowest paid, but most essential, workers.

Among them are the Ikogosi warm spring, the Osun-Osogbo river, and the Olumirin, Owu, Arinta   and Ekor  waterfalls. \nTheir scenic beauty and lush forests make these sites popular, but the impacts of human activities are likely to pose a growing threat to once-pristine freshwater systems. \nThe biodiversity and conservation value of these places has not been well researched. The conservation value of a freshwater ecosystem lies in its ability to support rare and threatened species, as well as species that indicate high ecological integrity. This is the ability of an ecosystem to support and maintain ecological processes and a diverse community of organisms.\nTo fill some of the gaps, my freshwater biodiversity research group collected samples of insects and other small creatures from four freshwater systems in the Obudu mountains, along the border of Nigeria and Cameroon. The area falls into the Lower Guinea Forest Biodiversity hotspot, where endemic and threatened species like western gorilla, red-eared monkey and drill gorilla are found.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere has been no previous study on the freshwater conservation value of the mountains, despite their known importance for biodiversity on land.  \nWe also collected samples of invertebrate species from the Agbokim waterfalls and the Kwa river of the Cross River National Park, all along the Cameroon border. \nOur findings revealed that the sites have very high conservation values. They have rare, notable and threatened invertebrates in the freshwater systems. These should be protected better. \nFreshwater macroinvertebrates\nFreshwater macroinvertebrates include aquatic insects like dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, stoneflies, bugs and beetles; molluscs like snails and mussels; crustaceans like crabs and shrimps; and annelids (segmented worms). Macroinvertebrates, particularly the stress-sensitive ones like mayfly, stonefly, and caddisfly, have been described as the best indicators of freshwater quality. Stress-sensitive insects are insects that decline in population when their environment is disturbed. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Nigeria's natural resources are under threat - urgent steps a new president must take\n\n\n\n\nUnderstandably, conservation attention is often focused on larger animals like crocodiles, monkeys and gorillas. These are the flagship species often used to draw attention to a  conservation area.\nBut the biodiversity and conservation value of the freshwater ecosystems are also important. Healthy freshwater systems are an essential requirement for animal and human life on land.\nFreshwater macroinvertebrates are ecological engineers with several functions in freshwater ecosystems. They serve as food for fish in the water. The adult insects that emerge from the water are food for  animals in the forests near the water. \nAlso, the presence of certain invertebrate species is a  good indicator of good water and environmental quality.\nImportance of this border area\nWe found that the freshwater systems of the Obudu mountains had more species of stress-sensitive mayfly, stonefly and caddisfly larvae when compared with similar studies in Nigeria. The Afundu stream in the mountains in particular had as many as 30 species of these stress-sensitive insects. The Kwa river of the Cross River National Park ranked second in terms of stress-sensitive insects, that is below 30 species. \nThis is a good indicator of a pristine natural environment. There is a direct correlation between their diversity and the health of a freshwater ecosystem and its adjacent forest. The presence of many species is an extra sign of a healthy freshwater system.\nWe also found two endangered damselflies, Africocypha centripunctata and Allocnemis vicki, in the Obudu mountains, and some rare mayfly species at Agbokim waterfalls, Kwa river and the Obudu mountains. The three sites have very high conservation values based on their species compositions and several biological indices. \nThe endangered damselflies are found only along the Nigeria-Cameroon border. With such a narrow range of distribution, endemic species like these are easily eradicated. Once gone, they can\u2019t be replaced. That is why any environment that is home to one of these species is usually given very high conservation attention.\nLooking forward\nThe three sites in our study appear to be havens for freshwater biodiversity. They are also candidate sites for conservation in Nigeria. Aside from the section of the Kwa river that we studied and a stream in the Obudu mountains (the Becheve Nature Reserve stream), the streams we investigated are not currently receiving due conservation attention. Considering the fact that ecotourists often visit the sites, they need to be well protected. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why microplastics found in Nigeria's freshwaters raise a red flag\n\n\n\n\nSince the Cross River National Park shares borders with the Obudu mountains, biodiversity conservation in the region would be greatly enhanced if the National Park Service of Nigeria extended its operations in the mountains. It could also partner with other organisations to do this. \nCurrently, the Nigerian Conservation Foundation focuses only on the Becheve Nature Reserve. The site that had the highest number of stress-sensitive insects in our study, Afundu stream, was not under the management of any statutory organisation.\nThese sites need protection because they could support other rare and threatened plants and animals \u2013 not all of them aquatic. \nThere is also a need for a more detailed ecological inventory of plants and animals in the pristine freshwater systems of Nigeria and their associated riparian forests. Without detailed studies, natural sites in Nigeria may, as a result of human activities, lose rare and threatened species before they are reported.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Conservation, Biodiversity, Nigeria, Gorilla, Cameroon, Monkeys, Freshwater, Osun River","role":"assistant"}]}

But not in the way that he might have wished \u2013 or expected. \nModi had hoped to win 400 of the 543 seats available in the Indian parliament. Yet as hundreds of millions of votes were counted, it emerged that his party would need the support of its partners in the National Democratic Alliance to lead a majority government.\nThis was after a multiparty political group of 36 opposition parties, the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (forming the acronym INDIA), and formed specifically to take on Modi, had made unexpected gains.\nRemaining defiant, Modi said on June 4 2024: \u201cToday is a glorious day,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is a victory for the world\u2019s largest democracy.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of the election surprised pollsters and experts around the world. And much is now being made of their impact on Modi\u2019s political power and personal brand. \nYet a third term as prime minister could still be considered a remarkable success. Only one previous Indian prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, has achieved the same electoral feat.\nMuch of the support Modi did receive will have been fuelled by a dramatic economic transformation in India. The nation now aspires to become a developed country \u2013 one with a relatively high level of economic growth and security \u2013 by 2047, exactly 100 years after independence. \nThat economic progress is clear to see across the country. There has been significant modernisation of infrastructure and an exponential increase in foreign investment. The country boasts a vibrant start-up ecosystem and targeted welfare schemes that are dramatically reducing poverty.\nThese changes have already pushed India into becoming the fifth largest economy in the world, up from 11th ten years ago. It could soon rank third, surpassing Japan and Germany.  \nIndia is also the fastest growing in the G20 group of the world\u2019s leading economies with a current growth rate estimated at 8.2%. Inflation, too, is much lower than it used to be, and was lower than UK\u2019s inflation rate between 2021 and 2023. \nThere are still big problems with rising inequality and unemployment. And prominent Indian economists, including the former governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Professor Raghuram Rajan, have raised concerns about the economy and the need for accelerated investments in human capital. \nA new deal\nBut overall, it seems that people have faith in the economic growth story under Modi and have entrusted him with another five years in office, even though these underlying issues might have meant that his party has been denied a crucial majority. \n\nAnd that faith appears to go beyond the voters. When it emerged that Modi was in fact not on course to secure an overall majority, India\u2019s stock market plunged. \nInvestors had been hoping for a strong, business-friendly government and stocks reached record highs after weekend exit polls indicated that Modi was on track for a big win. \nBut India\u2019s economic future could still be bright. To become a developed country by 2047, it has to sustain the growth momentum over the next quarter century, building on the economic gains of the last decade. \nIt also needs to ensure that inequality and unemployment are effectively tackled, perhaps through greater investments in small rural businesses and developing start-ups to complement the current large-scale investments in industry. \nAll of this will need a shift back to Modi\u2019s claim to work \u201csabka saath\u201d (with everyone), \u201csabka vikas\u201d (for everyone\u2019s progress), \u201csabka vishwas\u201d (with everyone\u2019s trust) and \u201csabka prayas\u201d (with everyone\u2019s effort). That effort, trust and progress will now have to be achieved in the form of a coalition government. \nAnd its members will have to show clear determination if the country is to achieve its aim of a \u201cdeveloped India\u201d by 2047.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Indian economy, Narendra Modi, Indian politics, Give me perspective, India election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

The oil industry argues that the project will boost revenues and stabilize the industry over the long term. The federal government claims that the project will create a \u201cfair price\u201d for Canadian heavy oil.\nBut what, among the claims, are the facts?\nThe federal government nationalized the TMX project in 2018 with the acquisition of its corporate owner Trans Mountain  which became a federal Crown corporation. Ottawa framed this decision around a short-term desire to address financial and investor \u201ccrises\u201d and push forward with what it viewed as a key Canadian asset.\nSince then, the project has faced many additional delays due to legal challenges, the permitting process, engineering difficulties, route changes, extreme weather (including massive flooding and landslides in 2021) and \u201ctechnical issues\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expansion project was first projected to cost $5.4 billion in 2013. In reality, the bill for the project in 2023 came to an astonishing $30.9 billion, and the final cost is yet to be disclosed. \nIt is important to push through the rhetoric and engage in some sober reflection, lest we fall prey to collective amnesia or misleading and rosy musings about the pipeline\u2019s long-term profitability.\nHow we got here\nWhen the federal government intervened in 2018, the project was facing \u201cunquantifiable risk,\u201d according to pipeline company \u2014 and the project\u2019s previous owner \u2014 Kinder Morgan. \nSustained resistance from the Government of British Columbia and multiple Indigenous nations compounded the project\u2019s risks which \u2014 alongside ballooning costs \u2014 made it increasingly unviable for Kinder Morgan. The sale of the project could cost taxpayers $17 billion. \nWhile the federal government promised no more federal funding in early 2022, further analysis showed \u201cadditional cost overruns cannot be financed without government backing\u201d.\n\nIn May 2022, it was reported that the six largest banks in Canada provided a $10-billion loan with a guarantee from Finance Canada. In other words, taxpayers continued to take on more financial risk for a project which further jeopardized Canada\u2019s long-term climate goals. \nSince the government purchased the project it has only become clearer that it is not commercially viable. The federal government\u2019s own analysis in 2022 projected that TMX will deliver a net loss for the government. \nSubsidizing fossil fuels\nIncreased tolls for companies transporting heavy oil through the pipeline could make up for some of the project\u2019s losses. However, these tolls cover only a portion of the costs and oil companies like Cenovus continue to vehemently oppose raising tolls on the pipeline, though this decision will ultimately fall to the federal energy regulator. \nThe federal government\u2019s decision-making around the TMX is reminiscent of other failed \u2014 and publicly funded \u2014 megaprojects with clear parallels to the Site C Dam project in B.C. Even more striking is the comparison to the Muskrat Falls hydroelectric project in Labrador. \nA commission established by the government of Newfoundland and Labrador described Muskrat Falls as a \u201cmisguided project\u201d driven by \u201ca combination of unrealistic optimism, a willingness to misrepresent costs, schedule and risk, and an inability to change course when things were going wrong\u201d. The same could easily be said about the TMX. \n\nThe TMX is the government\u2019s largest ever fossil fuel subsidy, despite claims otherwise. Indeed, to use the government\u2019s own language, the TMX should be classed as an \u201cinefficient\u201d fossil fuel subsidy which will \u201cencourage wasteful consumption, reduce our energy security, impede investment in clean energy sources and undermine efforts to deal with the threat of climate change.\u201d\nThough the federal government has not been transparent, estimates suggest the government and federal Crown corporations provided over $18.6 billion in total fossil fuel subsidies in 2023, including $8 billion in loan guarantees for the TMX.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nTMX has long been called a \u201cFaustian bargain\u201d as building new fossil fuel infrastructure locks in future carbon pollution and bets on the continued expansion of the oil sands. \nPut simply, to continue investing in oil sands expansion is to invest in a world of climate chaos. To force young taxpayers to help fund the future chaos that will disproportionately affect them is particularly galling.\nIf the world succeeds in addressing the climate crisis, Canada\u2019s oil and gas rapidly becomes uneconomic, with an enormous risk of stranded assets estimated at US$100 billion for physical assets alone. The assets most at risk are the  most expensive and carbon polluting to produce, like the oil transported by TMX.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How ideology is darkening the future of renewables in Alberta\n\n\n\n\nThe federal government now faces the impossible task of successfully offloading the project. Despite the government\u2019s promises for ownership schemes in partnership with industry and Indigenous nations and communities, the project has become much less appealing to private companies. Even less clear are the risks and costs that potential future Indigenous owners bear, including the significant risk of stranded assets as fossil fuel infrastructure loses its economic value.\nAbandoning the project would be politically disastrous for the Liberals with an upcoming federal election. However, it will be economically disastrous regardless \u2014 the question is for whom.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Fossil fuels, Climate change, Federal Government, Global warming, Oil and gas, British Columbia, Tar sands, Alberta, Fossil fuel subsidies, Trans Mountain Pipeline, Federal government Canada","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nKevin Jonas has become the latest celebrity to share news of a skin cancer diagnosis. The 36-year-old singer and actor took to Instagram to reveal he\u2019d recently been diagnosed basal cell carcinoma at his hairline \u2013 then documented the results of surgery he\u2019d had to remove it. At the end of his video, Jonas urged fans to \u201cget your moles checked\u201d.\nBasal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, affecting millions of people worldwide each year. It\u2019s a form of non-melanoma skin cancer. While melanomas arise from melanocyte cells that make the pigment in our skin, BCCs as well as squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) develop from keratinocytes. This is the main type of cell found in the outer layers of our skin.\nKeratinocyte skin cancers are much less likely to spread (metastasise) around the body than melanoma. As it\u2019s metastasis that typically leads a cancer to become fatal, BCC is considered to be a less serious form of skin cancer than melanoma. \nWhat BCC does share in common with melanoma is its major risk factor: exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, either from the sun or tanning beds. In the case of BCC, the cause is usually cumulative exposure to the sun. For this reason, these cancers often appear on areas of the body that are constantly exposed to the sun, such as the face. \n\n\n\n\n\nBCC and other skin cancers are more common in older people as they have had more time to accumulate sun damage to their skin cells. Almost half of all non-melanoma skin cancers in the UK are diagnosed in the over-75s. But as Jonas illustrates, they can occur in people of any age. \nThese cancers are also much more common in people with light-coloured skin, as the skin pigment melanin provides some protection against the damaging effects of UV radiation. However, does occur in people with darker skin tones. \n\nBCC appears as an unusual growth or patch on the skin. They can be either bumpy or flat and sometimes crusty. Although some can appear pigmented (particularly in people with darker skin), they are not moles because they don\u2019t arise from melanocytes. It\u2019s important to be aware that most don\u2019t look like a mole and are translucent, white, pink or the same colour as your skin.\nBecause there are many ways that a BCC can present, people are advised to visit a doctor if they notice an abnormal spot or sore patch on their skin that doesn\u2019t get better within four weeks. It\u2019s also a good idea to check your skin regularly so you know what\u2019s normal for you.\nBasal cell carcinomas are usually removed surgically, as Jonas\u2019s has been. The removed tissue will then be tested to ensure that all the cancer has been removed. Depending on the surgical technique used, the removed tissue may even be tested while the patient is present in case more tissue needs to be removed in the same session.  \nSometimes non-surgical methods are used to treat the cancer \u2013 for example, if the BCC hasn\u2019t penetrated very deeply into the skin or if the patient isn\u2019t well enough to undergo surgery. In these cases, topical chemotherapy drugs or photodynamic therapy may be used. In photodynamic therapy, the patient is given an inactive drug either as a tablet, an injection or directly applied to the skin. The tumour is then exposed to light of a particular wavelength, which activates the drug and kills the cancer cells.\nFor most patients, these treatments will be effective in treating the cancer. But research shows up to 60% of patients diagnosed with BCC or SCC will develop one or more new skin cancers in the following decade. This is why it\u2019s important to have regular check-ups and take extra precautions when spending time in the sun. \nBy sharing his experience, Jonas will almost certainly have helped raise awareness of skin cancer. This has been dubbed the Hugh Jackman effect by a group of researchers. They found that Google searches for \u201cbasal cell carcinoma\u201d increase whenever the Wolverine actor, who has been diagnosed with multiple BCCs, publicly discusses his most recent diagnosis or surgery.\nAs with any cancer, the earlier a basal cell carcinoma is diagnosed and treated, the better the outcome. By encouraging people to be aware of the need to get unusual skin growths and patches checked out by a doctor and being open about his surgery, Jonas has started a conversation that will hopefully lead to more people being diagnosed and treated early.\nAlthough BCC is very treatable, it\u2019s better if people avoid developing BCC in the first place. Alongside checking your skin regularly for abnormal spots and sores, you should also try to avoid UV exposure as much as possible. This includes staying in the shade when the sun is at its most intense and covering up with clothing and using sunscreen when in the sun.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Cancer, Skin cancer, Basal cell carcinoma, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Older children might avoid or refuse to do homework because they\u2019re afraid to make a mistake. \nPerfectionism can lead to children feeling overwhelmed, angry and frustrated, or sad and withdrawn. \nAnd yet perfectionism isn\u2019t considered all bad in our society. Being called a \u201cperfectionist\u201d can be a compliment \u2013 code for being a great worker or student, someone who strives to do their best and makes sure all jobs are done well. \nThese seemingly polarised views reflect the complex nature of perfectionism. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is perfectionism?\nResearchers often separate perfectionism into two parts: \n\nperfectionistic strivings: being determined to meet goals and achieve highly\nperfectionistic concerns: worry about being able to meet high standards, and self-criticism about performance. \n\nWhile perfectionistic strivings can be positive and lead to high achievement, perfectionistic concerns can lead to a higher chance of children developing eating disorders or anxiety and depression, and having lower academic achievement. \n\nChildren and adolescents may experience perfectionism in relation to school work, sport, performance in art or music, or in relation to their own body. \nSigns of perfectionistic concerns in children and adolescents may include: \n\nchildren being highly critical of themselves\ntheir reactions to mistakes seeming to be an overreaction\nintense preoccupation and worry over their standards and goals and\/or procrastination\nsignificant change in performance, for example, lower academic results\nirritability and negative emotions, stress and feelings of worthlessness\nsocial problems with peers and friends, such as bullying and alienating themselves from peers.\n\nA range of genetic, biological and environmental factors influence perfectionism in children. And as a parent, our role is important. While  research evidence suggests we can\u2019t successfully increase positive perfectionistic strivings in our children, harsh or controlling parenting can increase negative perfectionistic concerns in children. \nParents who are perfectionistic themselves can also model this to their children. \nSo, how can we walk the line between supporting our child\u2019s interests and helping them to achieve their potential, without pressuring them and increasing the risk of negative outcomes? \nGive them space to grow\nA great metaphor is the gardener versus the carpenter described by psychology professor Alison Gopnik. \nInstead of trying to build and shape our children by controlling them and their environment (like a carpenter), parents can embrace the spirit of the gardener \u2013 providing lots of space for children to grow in their own direction, and nourishing them with love, respect and trust. \n\nWe can\u2019t control who they become, so it\u2019s better to sit back, enjoy the ride, and look forward to watching the person they grow into.\nHowever, there is still plenty we can do as parents if our child is showing signs of perfectionism. We can role model to our children how to set realistic goals and be flexible when things change or go wrong, help our children manage stress and negative emotions, and create healthy balance in our family daily routine. \nSet realistic goals\nPeople with perfectionistic tendencies will often set unattainable goals. We can support the development of flexibility and realistic goal setting by asking curious questions, for example, \u201cwhat would you need to do to get one small step closer to this goal?\u201d Identifying upper and lower limits for goals is also helpful. \nIf your child is fixed on a high score at school, for example, set that as the \u201cupper limit\u201d and then support them to identify a \u201clower limit\u201d they would find acceptable, even if they are less happy with the outcome. \nThis strategy may take time and practice to widen the gap between the two, but is useful to create flexibility over time. \nIf a goal is performance-based and the outcome cannot be guaranteed (for example, a sporting competition), encourage your child to set a personal goal they have more control over.\n\nWe can also have conversations about perfectionism from early on, and explain that everyone makes mistakes. In fact, it\u2019s great to model this to our children \u2013 talking about our own mistakes and feelings, to show them that we ourselves are not perfect. \nTalk aloud practices can help children to see that we \u201cwalk the walk\u201d. For example, if you burn dinner you could reflect:\n\nI\u2019m disappointed because I put time and effort into that and it didn\u2019t turn out as I expected. But we all make mistakes. I don\u2019t get things right every time.\n\nManage stress and negative emotions\nSome children and adolescents have a natural tendency towards perfectionism. Rather than trying to control their behaviour, we can provide gentle, loving support. \nWhen our child or adolescent becomes frustrated, angry, sad or overwhelmed, we support them best by helping them to name, express and validate all of their emotions. \nParents may fear that acknowledging their child\u2019s negative emotions will make the emotions worse, but the opposite is true.\nCreating healthy balance\nThe building blocks of healthy child development are strong loving family relationships, good nutrition, creative play and plenty of physical activity, sleep and rest. \nPerfectionism is associated with rigidity, and thinking that there is only one correct way to succeed. We can instead encourage flexibility and creativity in children. \nChildren\u2019s brains grow through play. There is strong research evidence showing that creative, child-led play is associated with higher emotion regulation skills, and a range of cognitive skills, including problem-solving, memory, planning, flexibility and decision-making. \n\nPlay isn\u2019t just for young children either \u2013 there\u2019s evidence that explorative, creative play of any kind also benefits adolescents and adults. \nThere is also evidence that getting active outdoors in nature can promote children\u2019s coping skills, emotion regulation and cognitive development.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Mental health, Stress, Parenting, Health, Perfectionism","role":"assistant"}]}

The opposition questioned his response.\nOn Tuesday, he said Cheng, who works for Sky, was \u201ca very professional journalist. And there should be no impediments to Australian journalists going about their job. And we\u2019ve made that clear to the Chinese embassy.\u201d\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton welcomed the government raising the issue with the embassy. But he said: \u201cI do want to point out that the prime minister clearly misled the Australian people yesterday when he got up and did a press conference and said that he heard nothing of it [\u2026] it\u2019s completely inconceivable\u201d.\nMeanwhile, Albanese has indicated he believes there is no impediment to media organisations again posting correspondents to China. \nThe China correspondent for The Australian Financial Review, Mike Smith, and the ABC\u2019s correspondent, Bill Birtles, were forced out in 2020.  \nThey left after Chinese security officials visited their homes late at night, telling them they needed to be questioned over \u201ca national security case\u201d. Before departing, they spent several days under Australian diplomatic protection, while negotiations between officials of the two countries for their departure took place.\nThis followed immediately after the Chinese government confirmed Cheng\u2019s detention in Beijing. She was later tried in secret for what she said was breaking an embargo on a story by a few minutes. She was released only last year.\nAsked on Monday whether he had raised the question of the Australian media getting back into China, Albanese said he\u2019d done so in his China visit late last year. \n\u201cThe Chinese side say that they are willing to grant that access. And speaking to some media organisations as well, it\u2019s a matter of whether they wish to send people in there. I think that is the point,\u201d he said.\nA spokesman for the ABC said, \u201cThe ABC remains very interested in basing a correspondent in China\u201d.\nAlbanese and Li both attended a business round table in Perth on Tuesday. In an opinion piece in Tuesday\u2019s West Australian newspaper, Albanese writes, \n\nChina is Australia\u2019s largest trading partner and three-quarters of Australia\u2019s exports to China, come from here in WA. Furthermore, nearly 60 per cent of everything that WA exports, goes to China.\n\nAlso Tuesday, the Chinese state-run Global Times newspaper printed an editorial declaring a \u201cspring blossom\u201d in China-Australia relations now that Australia\u2019s foreign policy has gone back to \u201cserving its own national interests\u201d. \nThe newspaper made an indirect reference to the United States, saying countries like Australia had been under the influence of a \u201cCold War mindset\u201d that prioritised \u201cde-risking\u201d and \u201cdecoupling\u201d from China. But, it added:\n\nAustralia is now back on the relatively correct path after weighing the created geopolitical anxiety and the self-development interests. It should also give other countries a wake-up call.\n\nUpdate: Albanese tells Li the Cheng Lei incident \u2018unacceptable\u2019\nAlbanese, speaking on Perth radio on Tuesday afternoon, said he had raised the Cheng Lei incident directly with Premier Li, when they met earlier in the day. \n\u201cI [\u2026] told him that, in our view, that was clearly unacceptable, that officials tried to block the camera view. Frankly, that was unacceptable and not appropriate behaviour.\u201d\n","role":"user"},{"content":"China-Australia relations, Anthony Albanese, Cheng Lei","role":"assistant"}]}

News outlets have reported the destruction of books by Ukrainian poets and philosophers \u2013 but on reflection, the greatest loss may be to children.\nSince the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, Ukrainian publishers have prioritised the production of trauma-informed books to help children and teenagers cope with living through war. We estimate that more than 120 new titles have been released, a cultural phenomenon that is without historical precedent.\nAuthor Kateryna Yehorushkina was initially unsure whether it would still be possible to keep publishing children\u2019s books in Ukraine after Russia\u2019s invasion. She told us that when she had finished the manuscript of her book,The Holiday I Had to Take, in 2022, she didn\u2019t know whether it would even be possible to print the book in Kharkiv. \n\nWith the help of Vivat Publishing, Yehorushkina has published four books in the past two years and all were printed at FaktorDruk. Reflecting on the attack on the FaktorDruk printworks, she told us: \u201cLast fall, I came to Kharkiv to make my dream come true: to watch my book being printed and meet the magicians who work in the printing factory. Today Russian rockets took the lives of seven of them and many more were injured. Instead of children\u2019s books \u2013 burnt wet pulp.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThe children in The Holiday I Had to Take go on a trip to their basement to stay safe from air raids. The heroine, modelled on Yehorushkina\u2019s own daughter, misses playing with her friends when she\u2019s sheltering in the basement, but the unprecedented connectivity of this contemporary war provides a solution: they can still play Minecraft online. \nIn the book, they rebuild a historic airplane and Ukrainian cities from scratch, agreeing that it is easier to believe in good things \u201cvirtually\u201d.\nChildren\u2019s tales from the frontline\nEven soldiers in active combat are writing books for Ukraine\u2019s children. Vitaliy Zapeka first joined the Ukrainian Army in 2014 and is currently on the frontline. Vivat and FaktorDruk published his recent series of books about Polinka, a four-year old girl cared for by her quirky grandparents. \nZapeka responded to the bombing of the printing house with an impassioned Facebook post: \u201cThey\u2019re destroying our culture: people, people, people, books, books, books. F*** Pushkin. F*** Dostoevsky. F*** the Russian language.\u201d\n\nSince February 2022, Hryhoriy Abramovich Falkovych, a Ukrainian Jewish poet who at age 84 is not living through his first war, has published several books with the Lviv publisher Stariy Lev. These were also printed in Kharkiv at FaktorDruk. \nRudi and the Milky Way (2023) tells the story of a Jack Russell Terrier who accompanies Falkovych\u2019s family from Kyiv to a safer town in western Ukraine. \n\nFalkovych explains that family pets are also affected by \u201cloud sirens, bomb shelters, by anxiety over loved ones and the fate of Ukraine, and by concerns about housing, medicine and food\u201d.  \nFalkovych was inspired to translate Rudi the dog\u2019s thoughts into \u201ca more accessible human language\u201d. We are translating Rudi\u2019s story from Ukrainian into English, in the hope that that a global readership can access Falkovych\u2019s wisdom and humour and share his love for his new town through beautiful drawings by Iryna Potapenko.\nSad (and neverending) story\nUkrainian writers are not only compelled to think about how books should represent war to children in a responsible way, they have to consider that their readers are living in a story that still has no ending. Many of the books published since 2022 have been written in collaboration with psychologists and include activities and direct advice for children and parents. \nKateryna Tykhozora\u2019s Home, A Book About What Is Important (2024) is a picture book about a boy who had to leave his home after its destruction by Russian missiles. Powerful illustrations by Olexandr Prodan represent war as a threatening dark cloud with claws and teeth hovering over brightly painted houses. \nThe illustrations deftly combine black and white images of ruined buildings, shelters and crowded trains with the boy and his family foregrounded in strong bright colours. \nHome ends with a torn-out page from an exercise book with the boy\u2019s own drawing of his family in stick figures in front of their house. He can draw his vision of a better future but, importantly, the book does not suggest that a happy ending is near.\nUkrainian children who have resettled in other countries have not been forgotten. Halyna Tkachuk\u2019s Blue Notebook was written in 2023 during a residency at the Borderland Foundation in northern Poland. The book was published by Vivat and printed at FaktorDruk but, appropriately for a preteen\u2019s diary about her new life in Warsaw, it has already appeared in Polish translation.\nTkachuk is one of many writers and readers to post photos in memory of the seven printers and machinists who died \u201cmaking beautiful, high-quality books for me, for you, for everyone\u201d. \nNonetheless, we are certain that the destruction of 50,000 books in Russia\u2019s latest \u201ccynical crime against culture,\u201d as CEO of Vivat, Julia Orlova, described it, will not discourage Ukrainians from investing in the psychological health of their future citizens through children\u2019s books.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Publishing, Ukraine, Children's books, Ukraine invasion 2022, Kharkiv, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

The process involves the violent removal of people from encampments.\nSecuring these spaces is at the expense of some people and works to perpetuate and make invisible what German philosopher Friedrich Engels called social murder (a concept that has re-emerged amid many issues, including COVID-19) \u2014 an unnatural death that occurs due to social, political or economic oppression.\n\n\n\n\n\nAct I: Criminalizing poverty\nThis winter, in Alberta and around Canada, there was a dedicated effort to destroy encampments set up by unhoused people and to criminalize poverty. \nThe Edmonton police, in particular, have been active in destroying encampments and removing people\u2019s belongings, justifying their actions by citing concern for the public\u2019s safety. However, as many have pointed out, these concerns don\u2019t take into account the lived experiences of those in encampments and often exacerbate the challenges people might already be facing.\nIn this act, we see social murder through the increased deaths of people who were homeless throughout the winter. Settler colonial policies that prioritize private property, criminalize drug use, oppose harm reduction and commodify housing result in this type of social murder.\n\nAct II: Criminalizing dissent\nMore recently, the Edmonton Police Service and Calgary Police Service \u2014 as well as the University of Alberta and University of Calgary administrations \u2014 have come under intense scrutiny for violently dismantling solidarity encampments on campuses. \nThe protesters in these encampments are demanding universities disclose their investments and divest of any that fund genocide and Israeli settler colonialism in Palestine. Police responses to peaceful and legal protests involved baton-wielding police officers firing tear gas and pepper-spray balls at demonstrators. \nThese tactics were similar to the actions of police who destroyed encampments in the winter. The rhetoric of safety was again deployed, tents and items were confiscated and the ability to take up space was curtailed.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Encampment sweeps in Edmonton are yet another example of settler colonialism\n\n\n\n\nIn this act, we see police and university administrators colluding to remove encampments and silence questions of complicity in the ongoing Israeli military assault on Palestinians.\n\nAct III: Destroying homes\nThe concept of domicide is crucial to understanding how these two examples of encampment destruction are symptoms of settler colonialism and how police continue to maintain their colonial foundations.\nHousing scholar and activist Andrew Crosby uses domicide \u2014 the destruction of homes \u2014 to examine how settler colonialism is founded on the destruction of Indigenous homes and lives.\nConsidering domicide together with expansive Indigenous definitions of homelessness that include \npeople, families and communities isolated from their relationships to land, water, place, family, kin, each other, animals, cultures, languages and identities, we can see the various ways the Canadian state produces homelessness and often death for Indigenous people. That includes through the reserve system, fighting land claims and ignoring or violently shutting down land defence protests.\nIn Palestine, settler colonial violence has involved the destruction of homes since the onset of the Nakba, and now through the ongoing destruction of Gaza, the displacement of two million people and the deaths of more than 35,000 Palestinians. \nIsraeli settler colonialism enacts social murder by evicting Palestinians from their land, destroying their homes and continually expelling Palestinians who survive attacks from each place they are forced to relocate to.\n\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Does the destruction of homes in Gaza constitute genocide?\n\n\n\n\nStruggles are connected\nSettler colonial violence through eviction and social murder in Canada and in Palestine are entwined. \nIndigenous activist Mike Krebs and American researcher Dana Olwan explain that both Israeli and Canadian settler colonialism are defined by theft of land and removal of Indigenous people from that land, but also that acts of settler colonialism in disparate places work to hold one another up. \nKrebs also argues that Canada\u2019s support for Israel is longstanding and rooted in practices of settler colonialism.\nThe tactics used to remove encampments during the winter in Alberta were used again and made more violent \u2014 via the use of rubber bullets, tear gas and pepper spray \u2014 against encampments on university campuses. \nTactics similar to those used by the Israeli military are used against Indigenous land defenders, protesters and in everyday policing practices in Canada.\nOn National Indigenous Peoples Day, it\u2019s important for all Canadians to recognize the ongoing efforts to eliminate and silence those calling out Israeli settler colonial violence \u2014 and the complicity of Canada\u2019s public institutions.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Indigenous, Settler colonialism, Homeless encampments, National Indigenous Peoples Day, Domicide, Campus protests","role":"assistant"}]}

Or more precisely, he is being allowed to go at it again. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      BBC Question Time: analysis of guests over nine years suggests an overuse of rightwing voices\n\n\n\n\nThe mainstream elite in the media and in politics who claim to oppose Farage, and who pretend to stand as a bulwark against far-right politics, are again duly buying into the hype he has created for himself.\nWe could already feel that hype bubbling as Farage took over as leader of Reform. He\u2019d seen the party\u2019s fortunes rising and started to think there could be something in it for him to step into the campaign.\nWe could see it in the coverage of every move he made thereafter \u2013 every milkshake thrown, every inflammatory quip quoted and beer drunk, snapped and plastered all over the news as some kind of morbid excitement set in among the media. Finally, something exciting is happening in this otherwise rather dull campaign, where offers of \u201cchange\u201d and pledges to be \u201cbold\u201d are hollow slogans for the sides of battle buses.\nTo understand how a party which only received 2% of the registered votes in the 2019 general election, failing to get even one MP elected, can get such attention, we must travel back in time.\nUkip was a party created by a eurosceptic elite, for a eurosceptic elite, to put pressure on the Conservatives via the EU elections. It all seemed a rather desperate move at the time, as the issue was marginal at best.\nThe party received 15.6% of the vote in the 2004 European elections and 16% in 2009. But these are second order elections, prone to low turnout and high protest vote. In these settings, Ukip really only received a mere 6% and 5.6% of the registered vote, once turnout was taken into account. Hardly the voice of the \u201csilent majority\u201d.\nThe 2005 and 2010 general elections clearly showed the limits of Ukip\u2019s appeal. In 2005, the party received 1.4% of the vote and in 2010, it took 2%.\nUkip\u2019s election vote share\n\nStill, the first \u201cbreakthrough\u201d was in 2014 when Ukip won the EU elections with 26.6%. An \u201cearthquake\u201d, we were told. This was the start of the \u201cleft behind\u201d myth which served Farage well as it diverted attention away from his elitist stance. The fantasised \u201cwhite working class\u201d would come to play a key role in shaping the narrative after the victories of both Donald Trump in the US and Brexit. Proper scrutiny of Ukip\u2019s (and Reform\u2019s) programmes (or Trump\u2019s for that matter) would have also shown that beyond typical far-right measures and other gimmicks, their project was always deeply skewed in favour of the wealthy.\nYet even though Ukip really only received the support of one out of ten registered voters (9.5%) in 2014, in particularly favourable circumstances, the mainstream elite could not get enough of Farage. Finally, the UK had a \u201cpopulist\u201d contender worthy of the name. They too could feel the same voyeuristic thrills as their European counterparts, watching the \u201cirresistible\u201d rise of the far right (or \u201cpopulism\u201d to be politically correct, as we would not want to offend the far right, no matter how clear Farage has made his views).\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The word 'populism' is a gift to the far right \u2013 four reasons why we should stop using it\n\n\n\n\nWhat is striking is that it is this election which set in motion the 2016 referendum, even though Ukip was the only party running on a platform demanding that the UK leave the EU. For all the talk of \u201ctaking back control\u201d and \u201csovereignty\u201d, this reactionary experiment was decided based on the support of less than 10% of voters. Even in terms of votes cast, the referendum was forced onto almost three out of four voters who had decided to vote for parties who were not formally demanding the country leave the EU.\n\nAll this is to say, Farage has simply never been that popular. This is despite him campaigning in incredibly fertile environments in which parts of the media are dedicated to propping him up, and where even those who seemingly oppose his politics cannot get enough of him \u2013 as demonstrated by his record number of appearances on the BBC or the countless articles on \u201cpopulism\u201d in the Guardian.\nJust look at how much coverage a press conference given after one single poll has received, when other parties fail to get issues such as climate change, poverty or social care on the agenda.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      BBC Question Time: analysis of guests over nine years suggests an overuse of rightwing voices\n\n\n\n\nAnd if you think this is because immigration is people\u2019s key concern, think again. Indeed, as I explored with Lancaster university\u2019s Aaron Winter in a report for the Runnymede Trust, the \u201cimmigration issue\u201d is one that is clearly constructed in a top-down manner. Unsurprisingly, when people are asked about the key concerns in their personal lives, immigration doesn\u2019t rate. Ironically, the exaggerated focus on immigration could be argued to be elite manipulation rather than the other way around.\nSo, what\u2019s behind the rise of Farage? Well, the same processes which have been at play across much of Europe: the hyping of far-right politics as a diversion. As has become abundantly clear, there is no mainstreaming or rise of far-right politics without the active involvement of mainstream forces who normalise and platform them.\n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts?

It depicted him \u2013 together with canine sidekick Bluey \u2013 spruiking the virtues of Queensland as they crumble around him.\nBut several days after the deadline imposed by Irwin\u2019s legal team, the video remains live and there\u2019s no sign of legal proceedings. One Nation is harvesting political capital from the spat.\nThis storm in a teacup reveals the weaknesses and inconsistencies of Australian law on certain personal rights.\n\nAn uphill defamation battle\nIrwin\u2019s letter hints at a few legal avenues, primarily defamation. This is a powerful course of action, but not an easy case to make.\n\n\n\n\n\nIrwin would need to prove the video lowers him in the estimation of the ordinary reasonable viewer, or exposes him to substantial ridicule, or would cause him to be shunned or avoided.\nAs the video depicts Irwin as a largely well-meaning character experiencing a series of unfortunate events, it\u2019s hard to see how this would be made out.\nIrwin was unlikely keen to litigate and more likely acting on advice that a stern threat of expensive defamation proceedings would see the video removed posthaste. But the weakness of his case meant that One Nation could confidently \u2013 and gleefully \u2013 refuse the request.\n\nLitigation can bring vindication and court-ordered remedies, but even when successful it can result in unwelcome publicity \u2013 the so-called Streisand effect. This is something Irwin will now realise all too well, with this story being widely reported and the original video garnering more than 300,000 views, around double those of its counterparts.\nThe \u201cPlease Explain\u201d videos are at least partly trolling, and the troll has been fed.\nIneffective legal weapons\nIf you were thinking that a lot of public figures are complaining about defamation lately, you\u2019d be onto something.\nDefamation is a very popular weapon for those who can afford it (or who think they can). Setting aside its tactical use as a coercive measure, sometimes it fits the facts of the case and sometimes it does not.\nThe more difficult cases reveal some stark gaps in Australian law\u2019s protection of personal interests, driving aggrieved parties towards defamation where little else is available.\nFor instance, Australians enjoy no general right to privacy. That was why former rugby league player Andrew Ettingshausen sued for defamation after a magazine published a blurry photo of his naked form in the shower. To fit defamation law, the publication had to be tortuously framed as suggesting that \u201cET\u201d was the kind of person who would agree to such a publication.\nMore recently, Alex Greenwich\u2019s defamation suit against Mark Latham was gymnastically constructed to frame a tirade of vulgar abuse as suggesting that Greenwich was unfit to serve as a member of New South Wales parliament. An imputation that a person is professionally incompetent is defamatory, whereas mere abuse is not.\n\nReportedly, Irwin\u2019s legal letter complained that the video attempted to \u201cpass off\u201d One Nation as being affiliated with Irwin. \u201cPassing off\u201d is a legal cause of action that protects a trader\u2019s goodwill and business reputation.\nHowever, passing off requires deceptive conduct. It would be hard to argue that such transparent satire purports to be authorised by Irwin.\nThe letter also complained of unauthorised use of Irwin\u2019s image. In the United States \u2013 the home of Hollywood \u2013 the \u201cpublicity right\u201d gives a person exclusive commercial use of their name or likeness. \nBut that isn\u2019t the case in Australia, and even the US has an exception for parody and satire \u2013 see the TV series South Park for evidence of that.\nSatire and parody exceptions exist in some Australian laws \u2013 for example, in defence of some copyright infringements \u2013 but if the satirist creates their own image of a person, as cartoonists do, there isn\u2019t a copyright infringement to start with.\nAs an aside, these gaps around privacy, obscenity and image rights also leave Australians legally unprotected from deepfakes, unless other, usually criminal laws are engaged, such as those against direct victimisation or child exploitation material.\nIs it defamatory, or just objectionable?\nPolitical satire is an important form of expression, protected in most liberal jurisdictions. It is strongly guarded by the US First Amendment and it will often deserve the protection of the Australian Constitution\u2019s implied freedom of political communication.\nBut free speech is not a trump card. It exists within boundaries and the law of defamation represents one of many areas in which speech can attract legal sanction, notwithstanding underlying commitments to expressive freedom.\nAs of now, satire is not a defence under Australian defamation law \u2013 but the publication needs to be defamatory in the first place. Plenty of material to which people might object simply does not meet that test.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Law, Political advertising, Law reform, Satire, Copyright, Society, Pauline Hanson, Defamation, Propaganda, Pauline Hanson's One Nation, Bluey","role":"assistant"}]}

They will send their votes to Congress, which will count them and determine who received the most votes. Typically, the casting of electoral votes is little more than a ceremonial process. \nBut the last time this process happened \u2013 in 2020 \u2013 it was anything but typical. \nIn seven states, in addition to the official electors, others calling themselves electors met and purported to cast votes for Republican Donald Trump on Dec. 14. They did this even though Democrat Joe Biden had carried their states in the November election. They sent their votes to Congress just like the official electors. When the electoral votes were counted on Jan. 6, 2021, some in Congress argued these purported alternative electoral votes meant the outcome of the election was still in doubt.\nMany of those purported electors now face criminal prosecution. Some may be convicted. And the odds of purported electors trying again in 2024 are less likely \u2013 but still possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Contingent\u2019 or just fake?\n\nThese other electors labeled themselves \u201ccontingent\u201d electors, arguing they could be the \u201ctrue\u201d electors if lawsuits Trump\u2019s campaign filed to dispute the results ultimately went Trump\u2019s way. Some of these other electors drew an analogy to Hawaii\u2019s disputed presidential election in 1960. While Republicans carried Hawaii, a recount was underway when the electors met, and both Republican and Democratic electors sent their votes to Congress. The recount ultimately went Democrats\u2019 way, and Congress counted the votes cast by Democrats.\nIn 2020, Republican electors in two states, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, sent certificates that expressly included contingency language. The certificates said their votes would be cast only in the event a legal proceeding declared those electors the true electors. This language appears to have saved them from prosecution.\nOpponents and detractors have labeled them \u201cfake\u201d electors, because they lacked any state authority to act while presenting themselves as something genuine. These opponents note that Hawaii\u2019s 1960 election had a real recount underway, and there was no serious litigation in any state in 2020 when the electors met. Almost all cases had been dismissed by Dec. 14, and a few pending appeals had no realistic chance of success. The sole purpose of these electors\u2019 actions, opponents argue, was to sow distrust and confusion.\n\u2018No authority\u2019\nRegardless of the adjective, these would-be electors had no authority. In Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada, most of those electors face criminal prosecution on charges such as forgery and fraud. The charges could result in sentences as high as 20 years\u2019 imprisonment.\nOne major challenge in these prosecutions will be showing that the electors had the requisite intent to commit a crime. \nOn the one hand, it was quite obvious they were not the lawful electors at the time they purported to cast their votes, and they completed paperwork purporting to exercise lawful authority. \nOn the other hand, if they can argue they were relying on the advice of Trump\u2019s attorneys or other campaign officials, they might be able to show they lacked the intent to commit a crime. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, for instance, claimed that these electors were \u201cbrainwashed.\u201d \nBut each trial will have its own set of arguments and defenses, and it remains unclear what a jury might find in each case. \n\nRemoving ambiguities\nCould there be a repeat of 2020 in 2024? The odds are lower but not impossible. \nTo start, Congress enacted the Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022. The new law now requires each state to certify its election results six days before the electors meet. \nThat means there cannot be pending litigation to sow confusion on the day the electors meet. It creates finality before the electors gather.\nThe new law also removes from the old law an ambiguous provision that allowed a state\u2019s legislature to appoint electors after Election Day if the state failed to make a choice on Election Day. Some Trump supporters cited this provision to say that the legislature could name the Republican electors as the true winners sometime after Election Day. \nBut the provision was misunderstood \u2013 \u201cfailed to make a choice\u201d did not mean that the legislature simply disagreed with the choice made by voters on Election Day. That provision has been removed, eliminating one more potential ambiguity in 2024.\nThe new law also changes the way Congress counts electoral votes. To start, it makes clear that the president of the Senate \u2013 typically, the vice president \u2013 has no unilateral authority to make any decisions when Congress counts votes. Additionally, the law makes it harder for members of Congress to object to counting votes. \nIn previous years, one senator and one representative could object, which would force Congress to debate for up to two hours. It happened once in 2005 and twice in 2021. \nInstead, the new law raises the threshold for objections to require support from 20% of the members in each chamber. That makes objections much less likely. Additionally, the new law expressly instructs Congress that final certification from the states \u201cshall be treated as conclusive.\u201d\nOf course, electors could still try to stir up public discord in a state if their preferred candidate loses the election. Members of Congress can still try to object. No law can completely stop the risk of subversion after an election. These modest changes in law, however, will help reduce the likelihood that the aftermath of the 2024 presidential election looks like what happened after the election in 2020.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Donald Trump, 2020 US elections, Electoral Count Act, 2024 US presidential election, Fake electors","role":"assistant"}]}

Eucalypts in wet temperate forests are the tallest flowering plants in the world and home to an array of unique tree-dwelling marsupials, rare birds, insects, mosses, fungi and lichen, many of which have not even been catalogued by scientists. Yet our country remains in the top ten list globally for tree cover loss, with almost half of the original forested areas in eastern Australia cleared.\nThis loss has been devastating for Australia\u2019s native plants and animals and contributes to global warming through vast amounts of carbon emissions. The global biodiversity and climate change crises are inextricably linked \u2013 we cannot solve one without the other.  \nEarth\u2019s ecosystems, such as forests, coastal wetlands and tundra, contain enormous amounts of carbon. But deforestation and degradation by humans is likely to send global warming past 1.5\u00b0C, even if we achieve net-zero fossil fuel emissions. Protecting native forests is a critical way to prevent emissions, which must be achieved in parallel with a rapid transition to clean energy. \n\nWhat is being overlooked in current international climate policy under the Paris Agreement is the crucial role of biodiversity in maintaining healthy ecosystems and their integrity, which keeps carbon stored in forests, not the atmosphere. Healthy ecosystems are more stable and resilient, with a lower risk of trees dying and lower rates of carbon emissions. \nThe way we currently count carbon stores risk creating incentives to plant new trees rather than protect existing forests. Yet old-growth forests store vastly more carbon than young saplings, which will take decades or even centuries to reach the same size. \nOn January 1 this year, both Victoria and Western Australia ended native forest logging in state forests.  This is a good start. But the rest of Australia is still logging native forests. Extensive land clearing continues for agriculture and urban development, as well as native forest harvesting on private land.\n\nTwo states down, more to go\nThe end of native timber logging in two states is a chance for new approaches to our forests, which recognise the contribution of biodiversity to healthy forest ecosystems, as well as endangered species protection and clean water supplies. \nEnding native forest logging isn\u2019t entirely simple. In Victoria, consultation on the future of state forests is ongoing. The Victorian Environmental Assessment Council is due to release its final recommendations in July. \nThe Victorian government has also put in place a Forestry Transition Program to help forest contractors find alternative work in forest and land management. Some of these transition programs are proving controversial. \nIn Western Australia, around 2.5 million hectares of the state\u2019s south-west forests will be protected under a new Forest Management Plan. Protection of these landscapes is critical, as they have been hit by another die-back event due to drought and record heat.  \nThese forests hold significant cultural and ecological value. Known in Noongar as \u201cdjarilmari\u201d, they are vital habitats for diverse plants and animals,  including endemic species such as the ngwayir (western ringtail possum) and the giant jarrah trees. \nWhat about other states and territories?\nIn New South Wales, the government is looking into proposals for a Great Koala National Park, which would bring together state forests from the Clarence Valley to south of Coffs Harbour. But with no decision yet made, logging continues along both the north and south coasts, which were also hard hit by the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20. \nIn Tasmania, native forest logging fell sharply between 2012 and 2019. This cut emissions by around 22 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, equivalent to almost a quarter of Australia\u2019s transport emissions. \nRecent policy changes protecting giant trees will help protect some patches of forests. But  native forest logging is set to expand in other areas, including clear felling of old-growth rainforest and tall wet eucalypt forest.\nNative forest logging is slated to end in 70,000 hectares of south-east Queensland state forests at the end of this year, under a longstanding Native Timber Action Plan. But logging and widespread land clearing continues elsewhere in the state, ensuring Australia\u2019s place in the top 10 deforestation hotspots.  \n\nCan ending native forest logging help the climate?\nWe\u2019ll need to go further and ban logging in all native forests in Australia to help meet our net-zero emissions target, while meeting timber demand from better-managed and increased plantations. \nStopping native forest logging avoids the emissions released when forests are cut and burned. It would also allow continued forest growth and regrowth of previously logged areas, which draws down carbon from the atmosphere and increases the amount held in the forest ecosystem. \nThe natural biodiversity of our native forests makes them more resilient to external disturbances such as climate change. These forests have larger and more stable carbon stocks than logged areas, newly planted forests and plantations.\nIf we compare forests protected for conservation with those harvested for commodity production in the Victorian Central Highlands, research shows conservation delivers the greatest climate benefits through continued forest growth and accumulating carbon stocks. \nThere are growing calls to create the Great Forests National Park to the north and east of Melbourne, which would protect a further 355,000 hectares and more than double protected forests in the Central Highlands. \nNet zero: deep, rapid, sustained cuts needed\nThe world\u2019s nations are aiming to reach \u201cnet zero\u201d by mid-century. Meeting this target will require deep and rapid cuts in carbon dioxide emissions as well as pulling carbon out of the atmosphere into land sinks, especially forests. \nThe land sector is unique in that it can be both a source (logging, agriculture) and a sink (forest regrowth, for instance) for carbon. The natural way forests take up carbon can be increased through natural regrowth or plantations.\nUnfortunately, the current approach, based on IPCC guidelines, to counting this type of natural carbon storage can lead to perverse outcomes.\nThe carbon sink from forest regrowth only counts towards the \u201cremovals\u201d part of net zero when it results from changes we make, such as ending native forest logging. It doesn\u2019t count if it\u2019s regrowth after a natural event such as a bushfire. It\u2019s important to count  only human-induced changes in our climate targets.\nTree planting, on the other hand, can be counted towards net-zero targets, despite the fact that newly planted trees will take centuries to sequester as much carbon as found in an old-growth forest. \nThis type of accounting \u2013\u00a0known as flow-based accounting \u2013\u00a0can mean a premium is placed on planting and maintaining young forests with high carbon uptake rates, overlooking the substantial benefits of protecting larger trees in native forests. \nThat is, this approach favours carbon sequestration (the process of taking carbon out of the atmosphere and storing it in wood) over carbon storage (the total carbon stocks already contained in a forest). \nA comprehensive approach to forest carbon accounting would recognise both flows of carbon (as sequestration) and carbon stocks (as storage) contribute to the benefits that native forests offer for reducing emissions. \n\nCarbon accounting needs more clarity\nThis becomes a problem when forests and fossil fuels are included in a net accounting framework, such as the one used in Australia\u2019s national greenhouse gas inventory. \nIn net accounts, emissions (from fossil fuel and land sectors) within a year are added to removals, which includes the sequestration of carbon into forests and other ecosystems.  \nBecause this type of accounting only counts the flows of carbon \u2013\u00a0not existing stocks \u2013\u00a0it omits the climate benefits of protecting existing forests, whose stored carbon dwarfs the amount Australia emits from fossil fuels each year. \nBut if we separated out targets for the fossil fuel and land sectors, we could properly treat forest carbon stocks as an asset, giving us incentives to protect them.  \nAnother problem with net accounting is it treats all carbon as equivalent, meaning a tonne of carbon sequestered in trees compensates for a tonne of carbon from burned fossil fuels. This has no scientific basis. Carbon dioxide emissions are effectively permanent, as the buried carbon we dig up and burn stays in the atmosphere for millennia, while carbon in trees is temporary in comparison.\nAs trees grow, their carbon storage compensates for earlier logging and clearing emissions, which is an important climate benefit. But we\u2019re not comparing apples and apples \u2013\u00a0forest carbon doesn\u2019t compensate for fossil fuel emissions.\nLogging bans are important \u2013\u00a0but no substitute for ending oil and gas\nWhile ending the clearing and logging of native vegetation is vital for both climate and biodiversity, it\u2019s no substitute for preventing emissions from fossil fuels. \nTo make this clearer, we must urgently set separate targets for emissions cuts for fossil fuels and increased carbon removal in the land sector. This will ensure phasing out fossil fuel use is not delayed by planting trees, and that the carbon stocks of biodiverse and carbon-dense native forests are protected.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Fossil fuels, Climate change, Biodiversity, Forestry, Logging, Environment, Carbon sequestration, Getting to Zero, Native forests, Native forest logging, Old growth forest","role":"assistant"}]}

As an expert in counterterrorism and a former State Department official who directed the government\u2019s counterterrorism sanction initiatives, I see the latest move as a potential step toward a rapprochement between Washington and Havana.\n\n\n\n\n\nDelisting Cuba\nWith Cuba\u2019s removal, only North Korea, Iran, Syria and Venezuela remain on the list, which was adopted in the 1990s. While being named a \u201cnot fully cooperating country\u201d has few legal consequences, it gives pause to people, companies and countries that otherwise might be looking to do business with those states.\nIn some ways, the State Department announcement on dropping Cuba from the list is lagging behind actual practice.\nU.S.-Cuba engagement on law enforcement issues is already going on, having restarted in 2023.\nAnd on Feb. 7, 2024, officials from both countries attended a meeting of the U.S.-Cuba Law Enforcement Dialogue, which promotes cooperation between the two nations\u2019 police \u2013 the sixth such meeting since 2015.\nThat February meeting made it all the more likely that Cuba would be removed from the \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d list, which is, by law, reviewed every year. The question now is what that means for Cuba\u2019s status in the U.S. as a \u201cstate sponsor of terrorism,\u201d or SST \u2013 could that also be under review?\nUnlike the \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d list, there is no requirement to review who is named a state sponsor of terrorism, either yearly or at any time.\nOn and off and on again\nCuba has yo-yoed on and off the list of state sponsors of terrorism. The communist island nation was first designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1982 by the Reagan administration. Cuba\u2019s support for left-wing militant groups like Colombia\u2019s FARC and National Liberation Army (ELN) in the 1980s was cited by U.S. officials as justification for its listing.\nThe Obama administration removed Cuba from the list in April 2015, having concluded that decades of sanctions levied against the country had not worked \u2013 Cuba retained its communist ideology. Simply put, we at the State Department thought it was time to take a new policy approach with Cuba.\n\nDonald Trump waited until the very end of his four-year presidential term to add Cuba back on the list \u2013 and then had to rush to do so before leaving the White House.\nIn fact, the decision was made so late that the Federal Register Notice legalizing the decision was published on Jan. 22, 2021, after the inauguration of Trump\u2019s successor, Biden.\nAccording to the U.S. Embassy in Havana, the Trump administration was motivated by Cuba\u2019s refusal to extradite 10 ELN leaders living in Havana.\nBut national security experts have criticized the decision, noting that Cuba hasn\u2019t actively provided support to groups like ELN and FARC for decades.\nMoreover, the Trump administration\u2019s reason for adding Cuba back on the state sponsors of terrorism list went away in August 2022, when Colombia suspended the arrest warrant against the ELN commanders it had previously sought the extradition of.\nIn the hands of Havana\nThe consequences of being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism are more severe that being named as a \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d state. They include restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance, bans on the export and sale of defense \u2013 and some dual-purpose \u2013 items, and a range of financial prohibitions.\nCuba remains subject to both those restrictions and those stemming from the Trading With the Enemy Act \u2013 a law dating from 1917 but which has applied to Cuba since the missile crisis of the early 1960s.\nAs such, Cuba will not gain any significant immediate benefits from being delisted as a \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d state.\nWhile countries deemed not fully cooperating with U.S. anti-terrorism efforts are prohibited from receiving defense services or articles, Washington is not in a position, due to other restrictions, where it would consider exporting military equipment to Cuba. \nAs such, the latest State Department delisting is more important for what it signals: that the United States is interested in expanding its engagement with Cuba. However, Cuba\u2019s placement on the state sponsors of terrorism list \u2013 and trade restrictions under the Trading with the Enemy Act \u2013 will not make that easy.\nBut that may not be the point. Rather, the delisting of Cuba from the \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d list can be seen as a litmus test over the willingness of the Cuban government to open up to reforms.\nWhether the U.S. follows up on the change in status with a decision to remove Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, allow Trading With the Enemy restrictions to lapse or even normalize relations is very much in the the hands of Cuba\u2019s leaders. The next move will be theirs. They will need to demonstrate reform at multiple levels \u2013 economic, social and political.\nBut that will take time. Such reforms would require a major overhaul of the entire Cuban system, which requires a carefully managed transition away from state communism.\nEnagement: An election risk?\nBut Cuba can begin to demonstrate now, and with success, that it will continue to fight against terrorism. \nOn this score, the results from Cuba\u2019s last evaluation by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force in 2015 and the body\u2019s 2022 follow-up report are promising. \nCuba is deemed compliant or largely compliant with 38 of 40 of the task force\u2019s recommendations on terrorism financing, proliferation financing and money laundering. \nIf Cuba can demonstrate improvement in the remaining two areas \u2013 making sure that nonprofit organizations aren\u2019t being exploited by terrorist financiers and that new technologies aren\u2019t being used to fund nefarious activities \u2013 it could provide the Biden administration with more political leverage to begin the process of reviewing Cuba\u2019s status as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nThis leverage is especially important during a U.S. election year in which Trump is increasingly trying to paint Biden as a weak leader on the international stage. Dramatically shifting policy without concessions from Cuba may play into this narrative. It could also be an electoral risk, especially in Florida, where many anti-communist Cuban expats reside.\nEnemies no more?\nThe last meaningful attempt by Washington to bring Cuba in from the cold fell flat. The Obama administration\u2019s 2015 delisting of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism  did not receive enough of a runway to see if it could encourage Havana away from communism before the Trump administration reversed course. \nThe Obama administration\u2019s delisting was reversed in just under five years, which wasn\u2019t enough time to test the theory that warmer relations could induce Havana to move away from communism.\nThe latest move to take Cuba off the \u201cnot fully cooperating\u201d list could, depending on the outcome of the U.S. election in November, similarly become a victim of politics.\nBut the premise behind the State Department\u2019s decision \u2013 much like the Obama administration\u2019s delisting of Cuba from the SST list \u2013 is that person-to-person interaction is the best approach to pushing Cubans away from an ideology, communism, that has failed them in regard to their economic well-being and political freedom.\nAnd engagement like that requires time \u2013 more than the four years of a U.S. presidential term.\nIt also requires patience, persistence and a willingness to consider lifting sanctions. After all, successful engagement and policy changes are hard to achieve if you continue to call your would-be partner an \u201cenemy\u201d and \u201csponsor of terrorism.\u201d\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Diplomacy, Terrorism, Cuba, Caribbean, Donald Trump, Anti-terrorism laws, US-Cuba relations, State Department, US state department, Americas, Biden administration, US-Cuba ties","role":"assistant"}]}

At least that\u2019s what a New York Times article announced in 2023 in its postmortem investigation \u201cWhat Killed Penmanship?\u201d But there was no doubt about the culprit: technology. \nYou\u2019ve probably heard something like this before: the more time we spend using our phone screens and keyboards to type out everything from emails and texts to grocery lists to wedding speeches, the less we put pen to paper and the worse our handwriting gets. \nNews articles over the past decade from the BBC, The Wall Street Journal and The Atlantic meditate on what we\u2019ve lost by relying on typing alone, from meaningful thank-you notes to the basic skill of writing legibly altogether. Even those who once took pride in their cursive penmanship might now find their own handwriting all but impossible to read. As one CNN headline damningly asked: \u201cHas Technology Ruined Handwriting?\u201d\nArticles like these imply that bad handwriting is a uniquely 21st-century condition, a symptom of our dependence on smart phones and laptops, one of the myriad ways our minds and bodies are being rewired by the ubiquitous technology that surrounds us. But as someone who studies the world of Shakespeare and his contemporaries, I\u2019ve found that bad handwriting is not a new phenomenon at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical cacography\nIn 16th- and 17th-century England, the vast majority of documents were produced by hand. Even after the spread of the printing press in Europe transformed how books were produced, people still used ink and quill pens to write out the letters, financial records, legal contracts, marginal annotations and scattered jottings on which daily lives depended. \nBut even in an age when people frequently wrote by hand, messy and at times illegible handwriting was still a common problem. They even had a word for it: cacography, calligraphy\u2019s evil twin.\nIn countless letters that survive from the early modern period, writers apologize for their bad handwriting. Sometimes they blame it on circumstances: they were groggy from just waking up or tired late at night (\u201cscribbled with a weary hand in my bed\u201d reads one sign-off from 1585). \nSometimes the reasons were medical: a broken arm from falling off a horse, a hand injured in a duel or stiffening joints from the onset of arthritis or gout. Of course, a quickly dashed-off letter will always sacrifice elegance for speed. But some people seem to have had messy handwriting regardless of the circumstances.\n\nRobert Devereux, the Earl of Essex, one of the most influential courtiers in the age of Queen Elizabeth I, became notorious for his bad handwriting, which one contemporary said was \u201cas hard as any cipher to those that are not thoroughly acquainted therewith.\u201d \nThe politician Sir John Glanville described his own handwriting as \u201cso bad that hardly anyone but his own clerk can read it.\u201d The brilliant Margaret Cavendish, author of the proto-science fiction masterpiece The Blazing World, said in the mid-1600s that she spent so much time writing quickly enough to get all her thoughts on paper that she lost the ability to write legibly altogether. \u201cMy ordinary handwriting is so bad,\u201d she observed, \u201cas few can read it.\u201d \nThe Reformation theologian Martin Bucer allegedly couldn\u2019t even read some of his own manuscripts. Nor was he alone. As the preacher John Preston observed in a sermon, \u201cOne would think a man should read his own hand, yet some do write so bad, that they cannot read it when they have done.\u201d\nIn an age when corresponding in one\u2019s own hand was an important gesture of intimacy, some self-conscious writers nevertheless found themselves depending on the services of professional copyists to make more legible transcripts of their letters. \nThe Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus told one of his correspondents that he had used a scribe \u201cso as not to torture you with my cacography.\u201d Those who did receive cacographic letters might deeply resent being so tortured: Sir Philip Sidney, Roger Manners, and the Lord High Treasurer William Cecil all complained to Sir Robert Sidney about his \u201cevil\u201d handwriting.\nToo good to write well?\n\nBad handwriting, it seems, is timeless. Yet, its social and cultural meanings can also be shaped by specific historical circumstances. In early modern England, for example, at a time of comparatively low literacy rates, the ability to write legibly required education and training. \nWe might think then that elegant handwriting would have been seen as an index of social status. But the opposite could also be true: the aristocratic nobility were notoriously bad at writing by hand. Popular dramatists even made jokes about it. But bad handwriting may have been deliberate. \nIn fact, Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet says just that:\n\n\u201cI once did hold it, as our statists do,\nA baseness to write fair, and labored much\nHow to forget that learning\u201d\n\nThat is, elegant handwriting was a tell-tale skill of the upwardly mobile, not those who were born into power and privilege. Writing carelessly could be a way of asserting one\u2019s social or political clout by forcing others less privileged to struggle to decipher what one had written. In other words, messy handwriting could be a power move.\nToday, the ubiquity of smart phones and laptops has no doubt played a role in the ways we write. But for those of us who can\u2019t read our own sticky notes and to-do lists, it may come as a relief to know that bad handwriting is not an unprecedented phenomenon, but has its own centuries-long history. We\u2019re simply living a new chapter of it.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Writing, Letters, Handwriting, Penmanship, Printing press, letter writing, cursive handwriting, cursive writing","role":"assistant"}]}

Arguably, Australia is slipping behind while other countries forge ahead. \nFor example, China spent A$74 million on a new stadium in the Solomon Islands for last year\u2019s Pacific Games and also invited Pacific athletes to train in China. \nChina has also poached high-profile \u201cdiplomats in tracksuits\u201d such as Eileen Gu \u2013 a brilliant Chinese-American downhill skier brought up in California who chose to represent China at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.\nWhile most sports fans can list assets and teams bought by Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund \u2013 such as the 2021 takeover of English Premier League team Newcastle United and the controversial LIV Golf Tour set up to rival the PGA Tour \u2013 they would know less about Riyadh\u2019s training in sports diplomacy. \nIn February 2024, The United Nations Institute for Training and Research ran a five-day executive diploma in sports diplomacy program for participants from the Ministry of Sport of Saudi Arabia and the Saudi Olympic and Paralympic Committee in Geneva. \nRussia has also weaponised sport, from using mega events to deflect attention from its invasion of other countries to Gazprom \u2013 the state-owned multinational energy corporation \u2013 proposing a Russian version of the Champions League.\nWhat does sports diplomacy offer?\nSport, when allied to diplomacy, offers western liberal democracies like Australia an authentic, comparative and meaningful advantage over our rivals. \nIn addition to a bulging trophy cabinet, Australia possesses world class facilities, infrastructure, expertise and sports people. \nPrograms like PacificAus Sports \u2013 responsible for the men\u2019s and women\u2019s Fijian Drua Super Rugby teams, and the PNG Hunters Rugby League teams \u2013 are world class. \n\nAustralians value integrity, fair play and equality in sport. Some of our current and former athletes such as Curtis McGrath, Sam Kerr, David Pocock, Adam Goodes, Kim Brennan and Marissa Williamson-Pohlman (who will be the first Indigenous woman to represent Australia in boxing at the Olympics this year) are as powerful, genuine and effective off the pitch as they are on it.\nSports diplomacy, when done well, can break down stereotypes, transcend acrimony and bring people closer together via a shared affinity for physical pursuits. \nMeetings between, for example, sports administrators, government officials, and business people on the sidelines of a game create informal relationships that complement formal diplomatic initiatives, such as Australia\u2019s desire to better engage Southeast Asia via a new $2 billion push.  \nInternational sport generates public diplomacy opportunities, builds relationships and can amplify a state\u2019s message, culture and values.\nRaising the game\nThe Albanese government\u2019s new approach to sports diplomacy provides a chance to challenge our rivals but only if we think like our sportspeople. We need to work and train hard, innovate and try even harder.\nLet\u2019s hope other government agencies continue to get behind DFAT as the ongoing team captain, too. The Australian Federal Police, Australian Defence Force, Sports Integrity Australia and many other government agencies are also now using sports diplomacy.  \nFinally, there\u2019s also no point investing in the practice of sports diplomacy if it isn\u2019t analysed, measured, studied and researched by the next generation of academics and universities. \nWhile countries like Israel, Hungary and Saudi Arabia are developing research centres and university courses on sports diplomacy, the same cannot be said of Australia. \nDiplomatic practice, it should be remembered, is only as good as the theory it is built upon.\nBill Bryson was right. For a relatively small population, there are few countries that are as good, or as addicted, to sport as Australia. \nGames, sport and physical pursuits play a massive role in our culture, society and identity. These things deserve to be front and centre of our diplomacy.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Diplomacy, Politics, Sport, Sports, Sports diplomacy, Sport governance, Sport and Society","role":"assistant"}]}

The state was forced to backtrack on decriminalization measures that were passed in 2020 due to backlash over spiking overdoses during the COVID-19 lockdown period.\nContinued deaths due to drug use is all the evidence required to curb reform, despite the fact that these spikes occurred mostly during the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch shows that the pandemic exacerbated many of the factors underlying the drug crisis. Health disparities and a lack of resources in underserved communities, social isolation, economic burden, stress, a lack of access to treatment and barriers to care all contribute to acute health effects of drug dependence. \nRegardless of these facts, drug policy reform is being blamed for these outcomes. \nIt\u2019s still all about the politics, of course\n\nIn Ontario, predictably, the Ford government\u2019s position on Toronto\u2019s proposal is staunch opposition. Yet there is a sense of new momentum in the same old rhetoric: because drug users continue to die and use drugs in public places, presumably this means the experts and bleeding-heart liberals who supported reform have been soundly proven wrong. \nMost concerning, whereas conservatives and liberals may differ in their emphasis on punishment or treatment as solutions to drug problems, neither type of government seems prepared to fully implement a public health approach to substance use. That would mean addressing health disparities and deeper causes of substance use disorders, such as social inequality and social dislocation in Canadian society.\nNo North American jurisdiction has been able to achieve this, despite the depth of knowledge and increasingly articulate demonstration of progressive public servants. Bureaucrats and politicians speak the language used by experts and other knowledgeable observers, who in turn inform the public of the need for harm reduction and more comprehensive, meaningful social policy reform. Logically, this requires commitment to decriminalization to shift the emphasis from punishing addicts to rehabilitating them.\nIncreasingly, the discourse has gone further in establishing the need for more coherent public health policies addressing the root causes of addiction. To that end, important progress has been squandered by apparent bewilderment that addicts are still dying in large numbers, despite (and now because of) decriminalization measures that were never claimed to solve the problem of addiction, but rather to reduce known harms of criminalizing drugs.\nDecriminalizing drugs is not intended to be a solution to drug problems. Rather, it is a critical first step that\u2019s necessary, but not sufficient, for replacing prohibition with a public health approach.\nAlthough Canada has made this work for regulating cannabis, it still has far to go to implement a more progressive public health approach to other drugs. The dangers of drug use stem not so much from psychoactive substances themselves, but from the toxic and unsafe drug supply that is the result of criminalization. But most of these substances continue to be treated as dangerous enough to ban.\nYet there is scant consideration of the societal and legal circumstances and conditions that make drugs dangerous because they happen to be used in harmful ways by certain people. Whereas opiates, like alcohol, may have higher risk of overdose and adverse health effects due to physical dependence, all drugs can be misused with risk to health and public safety.\nAddiction and public health\n\nDecriminalizing drugs can make them safer, but not always, and reduce some harms of using drugs. What cannot be resolved entirely by decriminalization are the societal conditions that make substance use attractive enough to override considerations of concern for the self or others.\nAddiction thrives on hopelessness and feelings of despair, abandonment and disconnection, which are caused by homelessness, unemployment and discrimination, among other social problems. Despite the range of local addiction support services and treatment options called for in support of decriminalization proposals, so far decriminalization efforts have failed to go beyond half measures to implement a full array of integrated resources.\nFurther off course yet, there has been little indication of meaningful commitment to addressing deeper structural root causes of addiction in North American society. Canada\u2019s putative commitment to a public health approach has fared no better than in Oregon.\nNone of these jurisdictions have gone far enough to remedy the real causes of drug problems. The fate of Portugal\u2019s successful run as a global leader in tackling addiction, as opposed to punishing addicts, helps to clarify new lessons being learned in North America. \nAdopted over 20 years ago, decriminalization measures in Portugal have been implemented more successfully because its social safety net is far more comprehensive and better integrated with the criminal justice system. In recent years, as cuts to funding decimated rehabilitation programs, rising rates of overdose soon followed, demonstrating that decriminalization is not a silver bullet; if you do that and nothing else, things will get worse.\nPut otherwise, half measures are ineffective. Until we are prepared to go all in to solve the problem, people who use drugs will keep dying unnecessarily because we have not afforded them real hope.\nSadly, this is news to no one. Not just experts. The Liberal government went on the record years ago by recognizing that decriminalizing drug use is not a panacea. Rather than committing to the next step, then and now, the necessary first step has been taken off the table.\nHow about try giving it more time?\nAnother lesson learned in Portugal, that evidently has not been resonating here in North American society, is that the kind of change required takes time. Now that decriminalization has been tried (and deemed a failure) in B.C. and Oregon, the reigning logic appears to be that going back to doing nothing makes more sense than doing something.\nDespite great patience shown during a century of misery inflicted on drug users in Canadian society, trying something new is scary. Cue the same old moral panic scapegoating addicts as dangerous people who those in charge prefer should not be seen.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Won't somebody think of the children? Five reasons why drug panics are counterproductive\n\n\n\n\nDecriminalizing drugs can\u2019t eliminate people\u2019s struggles with addiction. To work well, it requires a considerable level of investment, similar to what has historically been devoted to policing and imprisonment of addicts. Redistributing resources to support the integration of services, housing and employment for more people is not, and has never been, prioritized over punishing drug users.\nUntil that shift occurs, we will keep falling back on failed policies consistent with a war-on-drugs mentality that has now prevailed for 50 years against all logic. In the meantime, be prepared for a new wave of antiquated arguments proclaiming more liberal policies a failure.\nCommitment to half measures creates more problems than it solves.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Drug use, Overdose, War on Drugs, Psychoactive substances, Harm reduction, Opioid crisis, Drug decriminalization, drug poisoning","role":"assistant"}]}

They carry signs saying \u201cNot in Our Name.\u201d \nTheir slogan highlights the fact that American foreign aid to Israel has long relied on the support of American Jews. Unqualified U.S. support for Israel was built, in part, on the promise that Israel kept American Jews \u2013 and all Jews \u2013 safe, especially after the Holocaust.  \n\n\n\n\n\nBut American Jews have never been entirely unified in their support for Israel or in their visions of what role Israel and Palestine should play in American Jewish life.\n\nNo consensus\nMy new book, \u201cThe Threshold of Dissent: A History of American Jewish Critics of Zionism,\u201d analyzes a century of debates among American Jews over Zionism and Israel. \nMy account begins in 1885, when elite Reform Jews, with a goal of full integration in Jim Crow America, composed the Pittsburgh Platform, which rejected Jewish nationalism out of fear that it would make them targets of antisemitic accusations of dual loyalty.\nTwo years later, Austrian journalist Theodor Herzl founded the modern Zionist movement, relying on European powers for support for a modern Jewish state. \nThe genocide of Europe\u2019s Jewish population in the Holocaust fundamentally altered American Jews\u2019 perspectives on Zionism. \nMany believed that only a Jewish national homeland in what was then Palestine could prevent another genocide. Others insisted that the lessons of the Holocaust meant that Jews must not contribute to making refugees of another group of people: the Palestinians who were then living on the land. \nThere were other issues that contributed to a new understanding of Zionism in the 1950s and 1960s within American Jewish communities. Among them: the Nakba, which was the expulsion of 700,000 Palestinians during the 1948 founding of Israel; Israel\u2019s treatment of immigrant Jews from the Arab and Muslim world known as Mizrahi Jews; and the rise in Israel\u2019s militarism.  \nAcross the 20th century, mainstream Jewish leaders manufactured an American Jewish so-called consensus on Zionism and Israel, in part by silencing American Jewish critics of Zionism. \nFrom the late 1940s through 1961, journalist William Zukerman edited The Jewish Newsletter, a publication that captured some of the voices of Jewish dissent from Zionism, including his own. He reported on Israel\u2019s human rights abuses against Palestinians and documented how American Jewish funds fueled Israel\u2019s military campaigns instead of supporting vibrant American Jewish communities.\nBecause Zukerman dared to publish this criticism, he faced campaigns of steep resistance, eventually losing funding and support from Jewish communal organizations. \nAnxious that Zukerman\u2019s dissent would cause \u201cincreasing trouble\u201d for American support for Israel, Israeli diplomats wrote to American Jewish leaders, and together they convinced some Jewish journalists to exclude Zukerman\u2019s writings from their publications. \n\nLiberation movements, American Jews and Zionism\nInto the 1960s, as mainstream Jewish leaders emphasized the urgency of Jewish unity on Israel and Zionism and showed growing intolerance for dissent, anti-colonialist activists gained momentum across the world. From 1948 through 1966, Israel held all Palestinians citizens under martial law, limiting their movement and access to opportunities and resources. Across the 1950s, Israel excluded Palestinian workers from the Histadrut, the state\u2019s largest labor union federation. \nActivists allied with the cause of Palestinian rights noted Israel\u2019s alliance with colonial power France during the Algerian war of independence from 1954 to 1962 and criticized Israel as an occupier after the 1967 war. They spoke, too, of Israel\u2019s growing alliance with apartheid South Africa in the 1970s.\nBlack and Arab leaders in the U.S. taught within, and learned from, these anti-colonial movements. Civil rights and anti-war activists offered new perspectives to debates over Israel and Zionism.\nRaised in a liberal Zionist family, student Marty Blatt was learning to fight for justice. Blatt was born in 1951 in Brooklyn, New York. His grandfather had died in a Nazi prison camp. In 1970, he joined the anti-war movement at Tufts University in Massachusetts. \n\u201cThe Vietnam war was a horrible injustice,\u201d Blatt said. From the movement and from members of the Israeli left, he learned that \u201cIsrael\/Palestine was another great injustice.\u201d \nWith no access to the history of Palestinians in school, at home or at the synogogue, young American Jews like Blatt who joined the civil rights and anti-war movements learned these lessons for the first time. When they then criticized Israel and American Zionism, they, too, met with hostility from the mainstream Jewish world. \nBlatt sought to teach his fellow students at Tufts with a course in 1973 titled Zionism Reconsidered. In it, he taught the history of Zionism, Palestinian resistance and Israel\u2019s Cold War alliance with the United States. He taught students that anti-Zionism was not antisemitism.\nOn March 13, 1973, in the midst of the semester, members of the Jewish Defense League, a far-right, anti-Arab, Jewish nationalist group founded by Rabbi Meir Kahane,disrupted Blatt\u2019s class. They called it an \u201canti-Jewish outrage\u201d and passed out a flyer that read, \u201cNot since Germany in the days of Hitler has any university dared to offer a course presenting a one-sided view of any national movement.\u201d \nBoston-area Jewish leaders urged community members to write to Tufts leadership to shut down Blatt\u2019s class. These letters used apocalyptic language to describe the damage wrought by his course, likening it to the destruction of the Jewish people. During this controversy, Blatt picked up the phone one day to hear someone who clearly knew his family history in the Holocaust tell him: \u201cYour parents should not have been saved.\u201d  \nAn article about Blatt and his course in Boston\u2019s Jewish Advocate was headlined \u201cTufts Anti-Zionist Course Seen as Abuse of Academic Freedom.\u201d Though Tufts stood behind Blatt\u2019s right to teach the class for another term, which it still touts on the university website, angry responses to the class appeared in community forums for years.\nDivided on campus and beyond\nIn the current moment, college campuses have been riven with debates over the boundaries between student safety and free speech and whether criticism of Israel constitutes antisemitism.  \nYoung Jews dismayed by the unconditional Zionist agenda of Jewish campus organization Hillel and who founded Open Hillel in 2013 are now active in Gaza protests as \u201cJudaism on Our Own Terms.\u201d They might be surprised to learn that in late 1972, even before his course began, Blatt and others founded the Tufts Hillel Non-Zionist Caucus. Hillel subsequently expelled them from the organization. \nFor over a century, some American Jews have modeled the idea that unqualified support for Israel and Zionism was \u201cnot in our name.\u201d They prioritized justice as a Jewish value and were motivated not by self-hatred or antisemitism but by abiding commitments to human rights and to Jewish safety and community. \nToday\u2019s activists protesting over the devastation in Gaza are testing the threshold of dissent and the limits of free speech and academic freedom. They embrace what they view as more just visions of Israel and Palestine and more inclusive visions of an American Jewish community, one with space for dissent and earnest conversations about Israel and Zionism, and one in which Jews stand in solidarity with groups working for justice in Palestine, Israel and around the world.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Israel, Holocaust, Zionism, Nakba, Civil rights movement, American Jews, Theodore Herzl, Gaza war","role":"assistant"}]}

My patients often tell me about being scammed.\nThe consequences can be worse than just losing money. The experience is traumatic for many, with some victims feeling deep shame and self-doubt in the aftermath. This can interfere with their relationships, erode their trust in others and harm their mental and physical health.\n\n\n\n\n\nTeaching older Americans how to identify and avoid fraud \u2013 and how to report such crimes \u2013 could go some way to mitigating the impact of this modern epidemic.\nElder fraud is on the rise\nA recent FBI report shows just how prevalent elder fraud is. In 2023, Americans over 60 submitted 14% more complaints to the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center, or IC3, than they did the previous year. Estimated financial losses rose about 11% over the same period.\nThese numbers, grim as they are, only represent the tip of the iceberg. For one thing, only about half of the reports of internet crimes to the FBI included information about the victim\u2019s age \u2013 which means reported incidents of elder fraud are an undercount.\nWhat\u2019s more, these figures don\u2019t include the many scams that take place over the phone, by mail or in person. And many fraud victims never report their experiences \u2013 often because they\u2019re embarrassed, afraid or unsure what to do. \nWhile people of all ages are victimized by fraudsters, older adults can be uniquely vulnerable. \nThe FBI has suggested that older adults are often targeted because they tend to be more trusting and polite. They often have financial savings, own homes and have good credit \u2013 all of which make them more attractive to scammers. \nOlder adults may also be less comfortable with new technologies, which puts them at risk. Consider that someone who is 85 years old may have retired in the year 2004 \u2013 three years before Apple introduced the iPhone. While many forms of technology have permeated our personal lives, it\u2019s often in the workplace that many people receive mandatory training \u2013 like how to avoid online scams. \nThe wide world of frauds\nIn 2023, tech-support scams were the most commonly reported type of elder fraud. Other common schemes include romance scams, online shopping swindles and investment frauds. While tech scams are the most common, investment scams are the costliest, accounting for nearly half of all reported losses from those over 60 last year.\n\nFraudulent call centers are also well known for targeting older adults. Such scams made up 40% of reported elder fraud cases in 2023, according to the FBI, accounting for at least $770 million in losses. Many make use of new technologies such as artificial intelligence to deceive people more effectively with voice-cloning scams or \u201cdeepfake\u201d videos.\nCall-center scammers tell all sorts of tall tales. In 2022, more than 600 people reported being victimized in a single timeshare-related fraud. They collectively lost nearly $40 million. And in the latter half of 2023, scammers posing as government officials and tech-support agents pushed victims to liquidate their assets or buy precious metals \u2013 with reported losses reaching more than $55 million. \nCombating an epidemic of scams\nAs with any epidemic, \u201cinfection control\u201d tools can help us limit the spread. Much like vaccines create immunity against viruses, prevention efforts can help people build up their defenses to avoid fraud. The main tool for preventing fraud is learning how to identify likely scams ahead of time. Here are a few FBI-approved tips to help you do that:\n\u2022  If you believe there is an imminent danger to yourself or a loved one, call the police immediately.\n\u2022  Be cautious of unsolicited phone calls, mailings and door-to-door service offers.\n\u2022  Don\u2019t click on any unsolicited links you receive via email or text \u2013 even if they seem to be from people you know. And never open an email attachment from someone you don\u2019t know.\n\u2022  If you\u2019re in doubt about a person or business, search online for their name, email, phone number and addresses, as well as details about their proposed offers. These days, most legitimate businesses have some degree of web presence. And if it\u2019s a scam, you might find others have already shared information about it.\n\u2022  Never give or send anything to unverified people or businesses. This includes any personally identifiable information, money, jewelry, gift cards, checks or wire information.\n\u2022  Make sure your computer antivirus and security software and malware protections are up to date. \n\u2022  Bad actors can use pop-ups to spread malicious software. If you see a pop-up message, disconnect from the internet and shut down your device. You can enable pop-up blockers to avoid accidentally clicking on one.\n\u2022  Don\u2019t give anyone you don\u2019t know remote access to \u201cfix your computer\u201d or other electronic devices. This could let them see personal information, including details about your financial accounts.\n\u2022  If you\u2019re told to lie to your bank about why you need to wire money or make a withdrawal, it\u2019s probably a scam. A legitimate business won\u2019t insist you keep secrets from family or friends, either. \n\u2022  Resist pressure to act quickly. This is a big one: Scammers often create a false sense of urgency. A legitimate business will let you think through your financial decisions.\n\u2022  Perhaps most importantly, trust your instincts.\nWhat to do if you think you\u2019ve fallen for a scam\nDespite your best efforts, you might still be taken in by a fraudster. If that happens, know that you\u2019re not alone \u2013 and that it\u2019s possible to recover. Here is some advice for dealing with the aftermath:\n\u2022  If a criminal gains access to your device or account, take action to protect your identity. If a bank is involved, immediately contact your financial institutions to place protections on your accounts, and monitor your accounts and personal information for suspicious activity.\n\u2022  Contact your local FBI field office, or, if the crime was committed over the internet, submit a tip online. \n\u2022  When reporting a scam, include as many details as possible. This can include names, dates of contact, methods of communication, phone numbers, email and mailing addresses, and websites used by the perpetrator.\n\u2022  Also note methods of payment, where you sent any funds \u2013 including wire transfers and prepaid cards \u2013 and account numbers. Offer descriptions of your interactions with the scammer and any instructions you were given.\n\u2022  Whenever possible, you should keep original documents, emails, faxes and logs of communications.\n\u2022  Falling for a scam can be frightening and stressful. Talk with people who you know and trust to support you through this challenging time. Some support groups include the AARP Fraud Watch Network and the Cybercrime Support Network\u2019s Peer Support Program. \n\u2022  If your emotional response is overwhelming, consider talking with a counselor, therapist or your medical team.\n\nIf you or someone you love falls into a fraud scam, you aren\u2019t alone. Not even law enforcement experts are immune. At the age of 90, former FBI director William Webster was targeted \u2013 an experience he bravely shared with the world. \nI encourage my patients not to feel too embarrassed to report what happened. Talking about these experiences is an important step toward fighting this epidemic.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Crime, Geriatrics, Fraud, Scams, Cybercrime, FBI, Personal finance, Age, Call centers, Senior citizens, Elders, Elder scams","role":"assistant"}]}

Rescue efforts are being stymied by the fact the land is still sliding and moving. The disaster has cut the main road into the mountainous region. \nPNG\u2019s mountainous highlands are home to millions of people, living at least 1,500 metres above sea level. People here rely on food gardens, often cultivated on hillslopes. Landslides are common. \nAs Australia and other nations send aid to help the rescue effort and survivors, attention will turn to whether fatal landslides can be prevented. \nCould deforestation be the cause? It\u2019s possible. But there are many other potential causes. In 2018, for instance, a large earthquake triggered many landslides across the highlands. \nStill, the example of Nepal gives some hope. Nepal was once heavily deforested, and suffered many lethal landslides. Mass reforestation has helped \u2013\u00a0but it must be coupled with other measures.  \n\nWhat makes land slide?\nMountains are not solid blocks of rock. They\u2019re composed of a mix of clay, silt, sand, gravel and boulders of various sizes and shapes, all held together by resistive forces, especially friction. \nGravity is constantly pulling this mass downward, but resistive forces prevent it from collapsing, in a constant tug of war. When the resistive force becomes weaker than gravity, the hillside becomes unstable. \nThere are different ways the slope of a mountain can collapse, but landslides are one of the most common. Worldwide, these disasters cause significant loss of life and damage to homes, roads, bridges and other infrastructure. \nWhat has to happen for gravity to win out over friction? Usually, it involves water. \nWhen water sinks into the side of a hill or mountain, it acts as a lubricant. It can also build up pressure, which reduces friction. Earthquakes and volcanic activity can also cause landslides by shaking the slope, making a landslide more likely. \n\nCan our activities make landslides more common?\nLandslides are common in mountainous regions with heavy rainfall and where earthquakes and volcanic activities are frequent. Taiwan, Japan, the Philippines, Nepal, PNG and Italy all frequently experience landslides. \nLandslides are often triggered naturally. But our activities can make them more likely. The risk will rise in regions where climate change is driving substantial increases in rainfall. \nWhen we cut into slopes to build roads or houses, we can make landslides more likely \u2013\u00a0especially if we don\u2019t improve drainage to funnel infiltrating water away. Mining can also increase landslide risk. \nTo safely build infrastructure or mines in steep terrain means relying on structural measures such as a good drainage system, retaining walls, and other stabilising structures. \nThat\u2019s in the ideal world. Structural measures are expensive. In poorer countries, development is often done without these safeguards, putting lives and livelihoods at risk.\n\nWhat about trees? When we cut down trees or irrigate hillsides, we can load the dice for more landslides.\nDeforested areas are particularly vulnerable to landslides. When tree roots die, they leave behind soil pipes (macropores), small tunnels able to channel water from the surface deep into the ground. This significantly boosts the pressure groundwater is under, triggering more landslides. \nStudies show landslides continue to increase for a few years after deforestation, indicating the decay of tree roots, decline and root strength and the formation of macropores.\nTrees on more gentle slope help stabilise the soil, especially against shallow landslides. That\u2019s because their roots go deep, anchoring movable surface soil to more stable substrates. Trees also cut how much water gets into the soil by drinking it. \nBut on steep slopes, trees can actually cause landslides, due to the added weight. And if a deep landslide is looming, tree roots won\u2019t stop it. \nWhat can we do?\nThe first step is to keep people away from high risk areas. Many countries have undertaken surveys of mountainous areas to assess where the highest landslide risk is. \nIt\u2019s very hard and expensive to stabilise a slope after a landslide. It\u2019s far better to avoid one.\nFor shallow landslides, the most feasible prevention is to keep forest cover widespread across the catchment.\nForests are important \u2013\u00a0but they\u2019re not a silver bullet. \nA study in Nepal found extensive deforestation peaked between 1985 and 1990. Landslides began increasing between 1995 to 2003, indicating a delayed impact. A different study from Nepal reported a reduction in the surface area affected by landslides following reforestation. \nThe effect is noticeable \u2013\u00a0but not huge. New Zealand research has found landslides are less common in forests than in pastures for areas with similar rainfall, and showed reforestation cut landslide sediment rates by at least 10% decrease within the first five years. Research on the Spanish Pyrenees found reforestation moderately reduced landslide occurrences. \nSo is it worth replanting trees on denuded slopes? On milder slopes, it will make a difference in cutting landslide risk. But this technique takes years until the roots grow big enough, it can\u2019t be used on steeper slopes \u2013\u00a0and it won\u2019t stop the really big landslides.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Papua New Guinea, Deforestation, Landslides, Environment, Reforestation","role":"assistant"}]}

Capsaicin is the major culprit. It\u2019s found in chillies, jalape\u00f1os, cayenne pepper, and is even the active ingredient in pepper spray. \nCapsaicin doesn\u2019t actually physically heat up your mouth. The burning sensation comes from receptors in the mouth reacting to capsaicin and sending a signal to the brain that something is very hot.\nThat\u2019s why the \u201chot\u201d chilli sensation feels so real \u2013 we even respond by sweating. To alleviate the heat, you need to remove the capsaicin from your mouth.\nSo why doesn\u2019t drinking water help make that spicy feeling go away? And what would work better instead?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater-loving and water-hating molecules\nTo help us choose what might wash the capsaicin away most effectively, it\u2019s helpful to know that capsaicin is a hydrophobic molecule. That means it hates being in contact with water and will not easily mix with it.\nLook what happens when you try to mix hydrophobic sand with water.\n\nOn the other hand, hydrophilic molecules love water and are very happy to mix with it. \nYou\u2019ve likely seen this before. You can easily dissolve hydrophilic sugar in water, but it\u2019s hard to wash away hydrophobic oils from your pan using tap water alone.\nIf you try to wash hydrophobic capsaicin away with water, it won\u2019t be very effective, because hydrophilic and hydrophobic substances don\u2019t mix. \nGoing for iced water will be even less effective, as hydrophobic capsaicin is even less soluble in water at lower temperatures. You may get a temporary sense of relief while the cold liquid is in your mouth, but as soon as you swallow it, you\u2019ll be back where you started.\nInstead, a good choice would be to consume something that is also hydrophobic. This is because of an old-but-true adage in chemistry that \u201clike dissolves like\u201d. \nThe idea is that generally, hydrophobic substances will not dissolve in something hydrophilic \u2013 like water \u2013 but will dissolve in something that is also hydrophobic, as this video shows:\n\nMy mouth is on fire. What should I drink instead of water?\nA swig of oil would likely be effective, but is perhaps not so palatable. \nMilk makes for an ideal choice for two reasons. \nThe first is that milk contains hydrophobic fats, which the capsaicin will more easily dissolve in, allowing it to be washed away. \nThe second is that dairy products contain a protein called casein. Casein is an emulsifier, a substance that helps oils and water mix, as in this video:\n\nCasein plays a large role in keeping the fat mixed throughout your glass of milk, and it also has a strong affinity for capsaicin. It will readily wrap up and encapsulate capsaicin molecules and assist in carrying them away from the receptor. This relieves the burning sensation.\nOK but I hate drinking milk. What else can I try?\nWhat about raita? This dish, commonly served with Indian curries, is made primarily from yoghurt. So aside from being its own culinary experience, raita is rich in fats, and therefore contains plenty of hydrophobic material. It also contains casein, which will again help lock up and remove the capsaicin. \nIce cream would also work, as it contains both casein and large amounts of hydrophobic substances. \nSome studies have also shown that consuming drinks with large amounts of sugar can relieve spiciness.\nWhat about reaching for that ice cold beer? \n\nThis is commonly suggested as a suitable approach to stop the burning. At first glance, this may seem a good idea because capsaicin is highly soluble in alcohol.\nHowever, most beers only contain between 4\u20136% alcohol. The bulk of the liquid in beer is water, which is hydrophilic and cannot wash away capsaicin. The small amount of alcohol in your beer would make it slightly more effective, but not to any great degree.\nYour curry and beer may taste great together, but that\u2019s likely the only benefit.\nIn truth, an alcoholic beverage is not going to help much unless you go for something with a much, much higher alcohol content, which comes with its own problems.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Chemistry, Science, Beer, Milk, Chilli, Casein, Kitchen science, Curry, Home cooking, home sciences, Flavor chemistry, Beverage chemistry","role":"assistant"}]}

To Moses, who was a teacher as well as an activist, math literacy is a civil right: a requirement to earning a living wage in modern society. In 1982, he founded the Algebra Project to ensure that \u201cstudents at the bottom get the math literacy they need.\u201d\nAs a researcher who studies ways to improve the math experiences of students, I believe a new approach that expands access to algebra may help more students get the math literacy Moses, who died in 2021, viewed as so important. It\u2019s a goal districts have long been struggling to meet. \nEfforts to improve student achievement in algebra have been taking place for decades. Unfortunately, the math pipeline in the United States is fraught with persistent opportunity gaps. According to the Nation\u2019s Report Card \u2013 a congressionally mandated project administered by the Department of Education \u2013 in 2022 only 29% of U.S. fourth graders and 20% of U.S. eighth graders were proficient in math. Low-income students, students of color and multilingual learners, who tend to have lower scores on math assessments, often do not have the same access as others to qualified teachers, high-quality curriculum and well-resourced classrooms.\nA new approach\nThe Dallas Independent School District \u2013 or Dallas ISD \u2013 is gaining national attention for increasing opportunities to learn by raising expectations for all students. Following in the footsteps of more than 60 districts in the state of Washington, in 2019 the Dallas ISD implemented an innovative approach of having students be automatically enrolled rather than opt in to honors math in middle school.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder an opt-in policy, students need a parent or teacher recommendation to take honors math in middle school and Algebra 1 in eighth grade. That policy led both to low enrollment and very little diversity in honors math. Some parents, especially those who are Black or Latino, were not aware how to enroll their students in advanced classes due to a lack of communication in many districts.\nIn addition, implicit bias, which exists in all demographic groups, may influence teachers\u2019 perceptions of the behavior and academic potential of students, and therefore their subsequent recommendations. Public school teachers in the U.S. are far less racially and ethnically diverse than the students they serve.\nDallas ISD\u2019s policy overhaul aimed to foster inclusivity and bridge educational gaps among students. Through this initiative, every middle school student, regardless of background, was enrolled in honors math, the pathway that leads to taking Algebra 1 in eighth grade, unless they opted out.\nFlipping the switch from opt-in to opt-out led to a dramatic increase in the number of Black and Latino learners, who constitute the majority of Dallas students. And the district\u2019s overall math scores remained steady. About 60% of Dallas ISD eighth graders are now taking Algebra 1, triple the prior level. Moreover, more than 90% are passing the state exam.\n\nEfforts spread\nOther cities are taking notice of the effects of Dallas ISD\u2019s shifting policy. The San Francisco Unified School District, for example, announced plans in February 2024 to implement Algebra 1 in eighth grade in all schools by the 2026-27 school year. \nIn fall 2024, the district will pilot three programs to offer Algebra 1 in eighth grade. The pilots range from an opt-out program for all eighth graders \u2013 with extra support for students who are not proficient \u2013 to a program that automatically enrolls proficient students in Algebra 1, offered as an extra math class during the school day. Students who are not proficient can choose to opt in.\nNationwide, however, districts that enroll all students in Algebra 1 and allow them to opt out are still in the minority. And some stopped offering eighth grade Algebra 1 entirely, leaving students with only pre-algebra classes. Cambridge, Massachusetts \u2013 the city in which Bob Moses founded the Algebra Project \u2013 is among them. \nEquity concerns linger\nBetween 2017 and 2019, district leaders in the Cambridge Public Schools phased out the practice of placing middle school students into \u201caccelerated\u201d or \u201cgrade-level\u201d math classes. Few middle schools in the district now offer Algebra 1 in eighth grade.\nThe policy shift, designed to improve overall educational outcomes, was driven by concerns over significant racial disparities in advanced math enrollment in high school. Completion of Algebra 1 in eighth grade allows students to climb the math ladder to more difficult classes, like calculus, in high school. In Cambridge, the students who took eighth grade Algebra 1 were primarily white and Asian; Black and Latino students enrolled, for the most part, in grade-level math.\nSome families and educators contend that the district\u2019s decision made access to advanced math classes even more inequitable. Now, advanced math in high school is more likely to be restricted to students whose parents can afford to help them prepare with private lessons, after-school programs or private schooling, they said.\nWhile the district has tried to improve access to advanced math in high school by offering a free online summer program for incoming ninth graders, achievement gaps have remained persistently wide.\nPerhaps striking a balance between top-down policy and bottom-up support will help schools across the U.S. realize the vision Moses dreamed of in 1982 when he founded the Algebra Project: \u201cThat in the 21st century every child has a civil right to secure math literacy \u2013 the ability to read, write and reason with the symbol systems of mathematics.\u201d\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Mathematics, Civil rights, Algebra, K-12 education, Math education","role":"assistant"}]}

That\u2019s when the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its latest jobs figures. Within minutes of the data drop, news organizations send out push alerts, pundits start opining, and the headlines \u2014 and headline numbers \u2014 coagulate into a simple narrative, often along the lines of \u201cJobs are up; the economy is saved\u201d or \u201cJobs are down; we\u2019re all doomed.\u201d\nThese narratives consistently influence investors and financial markets.\nAs a professor of finance, I think these simple storylines aren\u2019t helpful to investors. In fact, they\u2019re actually harmful. Initial narratives stick even when underlying statistics contradict the numbers that make the headlines. So on June 7, 2024, when the latest jobs data will be released, I predict that financial markets will overreact to the headlines.\n\n\n\n\n\nI get it: There\u2019s so much information in the two job reports the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases each month that you can pick and choose the data you find important. But ignoring nuance isn\u2019t a good investment strategy. And it turns out that economic reality is too complex to fit neatly into a headline. For proof, consider how markets responded to the past two months of jobs data.\nDig into the data\nLet\u2019s start with the April jobs numbers, which came out on May 3.\nThe headline numbers were worse than expected: The unemployment rate ticked up to 3.9% from 3.8% the previous month, and both nonfarm payrolls and private nonfarm payrolls were lower than anticipated.\nThe stock market rallied on this seemingly bad news because it saw the disappointing jobs reports as a sign that inflation might be slowing. That, in turn, could encourage the Federal Reserve to put interest rate cuts back on the table for 2024 \u2013 or at least investors had hoped.\nBut things look a little more complex when you dig into the data.\nThe unemployment rate did get worse, rising one-tenth of a percentage point with virtually no change in the labor force participation rate. On its surface, that doesn\u2019t look so good: It seems the unemployment rate has increased by 10 basis points. But that\u2019s because the bureau calculates the unemployment rate only out to one decimal place. But what if you go out to two decimal places?\nTo do that, you need to crunch some numbers yourself.\nYou can do that by going to the the bureau\u2019s Current Employment Statistics news release, navigating various rows and columns, and then getting the calculator out to work out a figure for the month that goes one decimal place further than what\u2019s released to the media. Then you have to repeat the process for last month\u2019s data.\nWhen you do that, you can see that the unemployment rate barely budged in April: It rose from 3.83% in March to 3.86%, an increase of just .03%, or 3 basis points. This suggests those seemingly disappointing official unemployment numbers weren\u2019t actually that disappointing after all.\nGood headlines, bad news\nYou\u2019ll see something similar if you look at the March jobs figures, which came out on April 5.\nThe headline numbers came in much better than expected, and financial markets celebrated. Total nonfarm payrolls came in way above expectations, at 303,000 jobs created, as did private nonfarm payrolls. The official unemployment rate dipped to 3.8%. On its surface, all great news.\nBut you would get a different perspective if you dig deeper into the data \u2014 especially the figures showing how many jobs were created in government and in manufacturing. You have to scroll a few pages into the Current Employment Statistics news release to find the relevant data \u2013 in \u201cEmployment Situation Summary Table B\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s all there.\nIf you look at the March statistics, you\u2019ll see that positions in government make up more than 20% of new jobs added. What\u2019s more, the data shows that zero manufacturing jobs were created in March.\nThis data suggests the March headline numbers \u2014 which suggested a very robust job market \u2014 may have been deceptively sunny. Too many jobs were created in government, and too few in manufacturing. That\u2019s not a very healthy jobs market.\nWhen pundits and the public ponder the job statistics that come out on the first Friday of each month, they should be be careful not to simply accept the headlines as the entire story.\nWhen it comes to the economy, simple narratives can be misleading.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Economy, Unemployment, Employment, Manufacturing, Jobs, Private sector, Unemployment rate, Indicators, Business, Bureau of Labor Statistics, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Hiring, Employment rate, Labor market, Public sector workers, US unemployment","role":"assistant"}]}

In 2024, there aren\u2019t many ills social networks don\u2019t stand accused of: the platforms are singled out for spreading \u201cfake news\u201d, for serving as Russian and Chinese vehicles to destabilise democracies, as well as for capturing our attention and selling it to shadowy merchants through micro targeting. The popular success of documentaries and essays on the allegedly huge social costs of social media illustrates this.\nOne of those critical narratives, in particular, accuses digital platforms and their algorithms of amplifying political polarisation and hostility online. Some have gone so far as to say that in online discussions, \u201canyone can become a troll\u201d, i.e., turn into an offensive and cynical debater. \nRecent scholarship in quantitative social sciences and scientific psychology, however, provides important nuance to this pessimistic discourse. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe importance of social context and psychology\nTo start with, several studies suggest that if individuals regularly clash over political issues online, this is partly due to psychological and socioeconomic factors independent of digital platforms.\nIn our large scale cross-cultural study, we surveyed more than 15,000 people about their experiences of online conversations about social issues. Interviews were carried out via representative panels in 30 countries across six continents. Our first finding is that it is in economically unequal and less democratic countries (e.g., Turkey, Brazil) that individuals are most often victims of online hostility on social media (e.g., insults, threats, harassment, etc.). A phenomenon which seems to derive from frustrations generated by more repressive social environments and political regimes.\n\nOur study also shows that the individuals who indulge most in online hostility are also those who are higher in status-driven risk taking. This personality trait corresponds to an orientation towards dominance, i.e., a propensity to seek to submit others to one\u2019s will, for instance through intimidation. According to our cross-cultural data, individuals with this type of dominant personality are more numerous in unequal and non-democratic countries. Similarly, independent analyses show that dominance is a key element in the psychology of political conflict, as it also predicts more sharing of \u201cfake news\u201d mocking or insulting political opponents, and more attraction to offline political conflict, in particular.\n\nReplicating a previous study, we also find that individuals high in status-driven risk taking, who most admit to behaving in a hostile manner online, are also those most likely to interact in an aggressive or toxic manner in face-to-face discussions (the correlation between online and hostility is quite strong: \u03b2 = 0.77).\nIn summary, online political hostility appears to be largely the product of the interplay between particular personalities and social contexts repressing individual aspirations. It is the frustrations associated with social inequality that have made these people more aggressive, activating tendencies to see the world in terms of \u201cus\u201d vs \u201cthem\u201d. On a policy level, if we are to bring about a more harmonious Internet (and civil society), we will likely have to tackle wealth inequality and make our political institutions more democratic.\nNetworks: prisms exaggerating ambient hostility\nAlthough our study puts online political hostility into perspective, it does not deny social media platforms any causal role in fuelling political polarisation and hostility.\nSocial networks allow content to be spread faithfully to millions of people instantaneously (unlike verbal communication, where inevitable distortions occur). Because of this, they make it possible to misinform or anger millions of people at very little cost. This is true whether the false or toxic information is intentionally created to generate clicks, or whether it is the unintended side-effect of the political biases of a given political group.\nIf exchanges on social networks often lack civility, it\u2019s also because of the possibility they offer of exchanging with anonymous and depersonalised strangers. This experience, unique to the Internet age, reduces our sense of personal responsibility and empathy towards interlocutors whom we no longer see as individuals but as the interchangeable members of political \u201ctribes\u201d.\nRecent analyses also remind us that social networks operate less as a mirror than as a distorting prism for the diversity of opinions in society.\nIndeed, outraged and potentially insulting political posts are generally written by people who are more committed to express themselves and more radical than the average person, whether it\u2019s to signal their commitments, express anger, or mobilise others to join political causes. Even when they represent a relatively small proportion of the written output on the networks, moralistic and hostile posts tend to be promoted by algorithms programmed to push forward content capable of attracting attention and triggering responses, of which divisive political messages are an important part.\nOn the other hand, the majority of users, who are more moderate and less dogmatic, are more reluctant to get involved in political discussions that rarely reward good faith in argumentation and often escalate into outbursts of hatred.\nThese selection and perception biases combine to produce the misleading impression that radical and hostile beliefs are more widespread and more morally tolerated than they actually are.\nWhen exposure to opposing views annoys\nThat said, the social media use seems to contribute to increasing political hostility and polarisation through at least one mechanism: exposure to caricatural versions of the political convictions of one\u2019s rivals.\nContrary to widespread belief, most of our virtual connections don\u2019t typically take on the form of \u201cecho chambers\u201d, isolating us into silos of homogeneous political worldviews.\nAlthough some networks are indeed constructed in this way (4Chan or certain sub-Reddits), the largest platforms such as Facebook (three billion users) and X (550 million) typically present us with a certain diversity of opinions. This diversity is often greater than the political diversity of our friendships: are you still in regular contact with school friends who took a far right turn? Probably not, but it\u2019s more likely that you read their Facebook posts.\nThis exposure to ideological otherness is desirable, in theory, as it should help us discover the blind spots in our political knowledge and convictions, acknowledge our common humanity, and therefore make us both more humble and more respectful of each other. Unfortunately, the way in which most people express their political convictions \u2013 both on social media and at the coffee machine \u2013 is rather lacking in nuance and tactfulness. It tends to reduce opposing positions to demonised caricatures, and is less concerned with persuading the other side than with signaling devotion to particular groups or causes, galvanising people who already agree with you, and maintaining connections with like-minded friends.\nBased on field experiments carried out on Twitter and interviews with Democrat and Republican activists, sociologist Chris Bail has issued a warning to us in his book The Prism of Social Networks. He explains that repeated exposure to unconvincing claims or headlines produced by our political enemies (a fortiori posts attacking one\u2019s ingroup) can paradoxically reinforce partisans from each side in their pre-existing positions and identities, rather than bringing them closer to each other in terms of worldviews and sentiments. \n\nHowever, this relationship between social media use and political polarization seems to depend a lot on duration of exposure and does not appear in all the samples surveyed. Thus, recent studies exploring the effects of stopping Facebook and Instagram  use failed to observe that social media noticeably polarize users\u2019 political opinions.\nLet us always remember that narratives pointing to threats on society enjoy a considerable competitive advantage on the market of ideas and conversations, due to their attractiveness to our minds. One should thus approach the question of the relationship between social media, and political hostility and polarisation, by avoiding the symmetrical pitfalls of naive optimism and collective panic.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Social media, Polarisation, The Conversation Europe","role":"assistant"}]}

My friend and colleague was responsible for setting up Africa\u2019s first dedicated child exploitation and human trafficking units, and for many years he was a senior investigating officer for the Child Exploitation Online Protection Centre at the UK\u2019s National Crime Agency, specialising in extra territorial prosecutions on child exploitation across the globe.\nBut what happened when he recently volunteered for a demonstration of cutting-edge identification software left him speechless. Within seconds of being fed with an image of how Lay looks today, the AI app sourced a dizzying array of online photos of him that he had never seen before \u2013 including in the background of someone else\u2019s photographs from a British Lions rugby match in Auckland eight years earlier.\n\u201cIt was mind-blowing,\u201d Lay told me. \u201cAnd then the demonstrator scrolled down to two more pictures, taken on two separate beaches \u2013 one in Turkey and another in Spain \u2013 probably harvested from social media. They were of another family but with me, my wife and two kids in the background. The kids would have been six or seven; they\u2019re now 20 and 22.\u201d\n\nThe AI in question was one of an arsenal of new tools deployed in Quito, Ecuador, in March when Lay worked with a ten-country taskforce to rapidly identify and locate perpetrators and victims of online child sexual exploitation and abuse \u2013 a hidden pandemic with over 300 million victims around the world every year.\nThat is where the work of the Childlight Global Child Safety Institute, based at the University of Edinburgh, comes in. Launched a little over a year ago in March 2023 with the financial support of the Human Dignity Foundation, Childlight\u2019s vision is to use the illuminating power of data and insight to better understand the nature and extent of child sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\n\nThis article is part of Conversation Insights\nThe Insights team generates long-form journalism derived from interdisciplinary research. The team is working with academics from different backgrounds who have been engaged in projects aimed at tackling societal and scientific challenges.\n\nI am a professor of international child protection research and Childlight\u2019s director of data, and for nearly 20 years I have been researching sexual abuse and child maltreatment, including with the New York City Alliance Against Sexual Assault and Unicef.\nThe fight to keep our young people safe and secure from harm has been hampered by a data disconnect \u2013 data differs in quality and consistency around the world, definitions differ and, frankly, transparency isn\u2019t what it should be. Our aim is to work in partnership with many others to help join up the system, close the data gaps and shine a light on some of the world\u2019s darkest crimes.\n302 million victims in one year\nOur new report, Into The Light, has produced the world\u2019s first estimates of the scale of the problem in terms of victims and perpetrators. \nOur estimates are based on a meta-analysis of 125 representative studies published between 2011 and 2023, and highlight that one in eight children \u2013 302 million young people \u2013 have experienced online sexual abuse and exploitation in a one year period preceding the national surveys. \nAdditionally, we analysed tens of millions of reports to the five main global watchdog and policing organisations \u2013 the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Canadian Centre for Child Protection (C3P), the International Association of Internet Hotlines (INHOPE), and Interpol\u2019s International Child Sexual Exploitation database (ICSE). This helped us better understand the nature of child sexual abuse images and videos online.\nWhile huge data gaps mean this is only a starting point, and far from a definitive figure, the numbers we have uncovered are shocking.\nWe found that nearly 13% of the world\u2019s children have been victims of non-consensual taking, sharing and exposure to sexual images and videos.\nIn addition, just over 12% of children globally are estimated to have been subject to online solicitation, such as unwanted sexual talk which can include non-consensual sexting, unwanted sexual questions and unwanted sexual act requests by adults or other youths.\nCases have soared since COVID changed the online habits of the world. For example, the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) reported in 2023 that child sexual abuse material featuring primary school children aged seven to ten being coached to perform sexual acts online had risen by more than 1,000% since the UK went into lockdown. \nThe charity pointed out that during the pandemic, thousands of children became more reliant on the internet to learn, socialise, and play and that this was something which internet predators exploited to coerce more children into sexual activities \u2013 sometimes even including friends or siblings over webcams and smartphones.\nThere has also been a sharp rise in reports of  \u201cfinancial sextortion\u201d, with children blackmailed over sexual imagery that abusers have tricked them into providing \u2013 often with tragic results, with a spate of suicides across the world.\nThis abuse can also utilise AI deepfake technology \u2013 notoriously used recently to generate false sexual images of the singer Taylor Swift.\nOur estimates indicate that just over 3% of children globally experienced sexual extortion in the past year.\nA child sexual exploitation pandemic\nThis child sexual exploitation and abuse pandemic affects pupils in every classroom, in every school, in every country, and it needs to be tackled urgently as a public health emergency. As with all pandemics, such as COVID and AIDS, the world must come together and provide an immediate and comprehensive public health response.\nOur report also highlights a survey which examines a representative sample of 4,918 men aged over 18 living in Australia, the UK and the US. It has produced some startling findings. In terms of perpetrators:\n\nOne in nine men in the US (equating to almost 14 million men) admitted online sexual offending against children at some point in their lives \u2013 enough offenders to form a line stretching from California on the west coast to North Carolina in the east or to fill a Super Bowl stadium more than 200 times over. \nThe surveys found that 7% of men in the UK had admitted the same \u2013 equating to 1.8 million offenders, or enough to fill the O2 area 90 times over and by 7.5% of men in Australia (nearly 700,000).\nMeanwhile, millions across all three countries said they would also seek to commit contact sexual offences against children if they knew no one would find out, a finding that should be considered in tandem with other research indicating that those who watch child sexual abuse material are at high risk of going on to contact or abuse a child physically.\n\nThe internet has enabled communities of sex offenders to easily and rapidly share child abuse and exploitation images on a staggering scale, and this in turn, increases demand for such content among new users and increases rates of abuse of children, shattering countless lives.\nIn fact, more than 36 million reports of online sexual images of children who fell victim to all forms form of sexual exploitation and abuse were filed in 2023 to watchdogs by companies such as X, Facebook, Instagram, Google, WhatsApp and members of the public. That equates to one report every single second.\nQuito operation\nLike everywhere in the world, Ecuador is in the grip of this modern, transnational problem: the rapid spread of child sexual exploitation and abuse online. It can see an abuser in, say, London, pay another abuser in somewhere like the Philippines to produce images of atrocities against a child that are in turn hosted by a data centre in the Netherlands and dispersed instantly across multiple other countries.\nWhen Lay \u2013 who is also Childlight\u2019s director of engagement and risk \u2013 was in Quito in 2024, martial law meant a large hotel normally busy with tourists flocking for the delights of the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, was eerily quiet, save for a group of 40 law enforcement analysts, researchers and prosecutors who had more than 15,000 child sexual abuse images and videos to analyse.\nThe cache of files included material logged with authorities annually, content from seized devices, and from Interpol\u2019s International Child Sexual Exploitation (ICSE) database database. The files were potentially linked to perpetrators in ten Latin American and Caribbean countries: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Peru and the Dominican Republic.\n\nChild exploitation exists in every part of the world but, based on intelligence from multiple partners in the field, we estimate that a majority of Interpol member countries lack the training and resources to properly respond to evidence of child sexual abuse material shared with them by organisations like the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). NCMEC is a body created by US Congress to log and process evidence of child sexual abuse material uploaded around the world and spotted, largely, by tech giants. However, we believe this lack of capacity means that millions of reports alerting law enforcement to abuse material are not even opened.\nThe Ecuador operation, in conjunction with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children (ICMEC) and US Homeland Security, aimed to help change that by supporting authorities to develop further skills and confidence to identify and locate sex offenders and rescue child victims.\nCentral to the Quito operation was Interpol\u2019s database database that contains around five million images and videos that specialised investigators from more than 68 countries use to share data and co-operate on cases.\nUsing image and video comparison software \u2013 essentially photo ID work that instantly recognises the digital fingerprint of images \u2013 investigators can quickly compare images they have uncovered with images contained in the database. The software can instantly make connections between victims, abusers and places. It also avoids duplication of effort and saves precious time by letting investigators know whether images have already been discovered or identified in another country. So far, it has helped identify more than 37,900 victims worldwide.\nLay has significant field experience using these resources to help Childlight turn data into action \u2013 recently providing technical advice to law enforcement in Kenya where successes included using data to arrest paedophile Thomas Scheller. In 2023, Scheller, 74, was given an 81-year jail sentence. The German national was found guilty by a Nairobi court of three counts of trafficking, indecent acts with minors and possession of child sexual abuse material.\n\nBut despite these data strides, there are concerns about the inability of law enforcement to keep pace with a problem too large for officers to arrest their way out of. It is one enabled by emerging technological advances, including AI-generated abuse images, which threaten to overwhelm authorities with their scale. \nIn Quito, over a warming rainy season meal of encocado de pescado, a tasty regional dish of fish in a coconut sauce served with white rice, Lay explained:\n\nThis certainly isn\u2019t to single out Latin America but it\u2019s become clear that there\u2019s an imbalance in the way countries around the world deal with data. There are some that deal with pretty much every referral that comes in, and if it\u2019s not dealt with and something happens, people can lose their jobs. On the opposite side of the coin, some countries are receiving thousands of email referrals a day that don\u2019t even get opened.\n\nNow, we are seeing evidence that advances in technology can also be utilised to fight online sexual predators. But the use of such technology raises ethical questions.\nContentious AI tool draws on 40 billion online images\nThe powerful, but contentious AI tool, that left Lay speechless was a case in point: one of multiple AI facial recognition tools that have come onto the market, and with multiple applications. The technology can help identify people using billions of images scraped from the internet, including social media.\nAI facial recognition software like this has reportedly been used by Ukraine to debunk false social media posts, enhance safety at check points and identify Russian infiltrators, as well as dead soldiers. It was also reportedly used to help identify rioters who stormed the US capital in 2021. \nThe New York Times magazine reported on another remarkable case. In May 2019, an internet provider alerted authorities after a user received images depicting the sexual abuse of a young girl.\nOne grainy image held a vital clue: an adult face visible in the background that the facial recognition company was able to match to an image on an Instagram account featuring the same man, again in the background. This was in spite of the fact that the image of his face would have appeared about half the size of a human fingernail when viewing it. It helped investigators pinpoint his identity and the Las Vegas location where he was found to be creating the child sexual abuse material to sell on the dark web. That led to the rescue of a seven-year-old girl and to him being sentenced to 35 years in jail.\nMeanwhile, for its part, the UK government recently argued that facial recognition software can allow police to \u201cstay one step ahead of criminals\u201d and make Britain\u2019s streets safer. Although, at the moment, the use of such software is not allowed in the UK.\nWhen Lay volunteered to allow his own features to be analysed, he was stunned that within seconds the app produced a wealth of images, including one that captured him in the background of a photo taken at the rugby match years before. Think about how investigators can equally match a distinctive tattoo or unusual wallpaper where abuse has occurred and the potential of this as a crime-fighting tool is easy to appreciate. \nOf course, it is also easy to appreciate the concerns some people have on civil liberties grounds which have limited the use of such technology across Europe. In the wrong hands, what might such technology mean for a political dissident in hiding for instance? One Chinese facial recognition startup has come under scrutiny by the US government for its alleged role in the surveillance of the Uyghur minority group, for example.\nRole of big tech\nSimilar points are sometimes made by big tech proponents of end-to-end encryption on popular apps: apps which are also used to share child abuse and exploitation files on an industrial scale \u2013 effectively turning the lights off on some of the world\u2019s darkest crimes.\nWhy \u2013 ask the privacy purists \u2013 should anyone else have the right to know about their private content?\nAnd so, it may seem to some that we have reached a Kafkaesque point where the right to privacy of abusers risks trumping the privacy and safety rights of the children they are abusing.\nClearly then, if encryption of popular file sharing apps is to be the norm, a balance must be struck that meets the desire for privacy for all users, with the proactive detection of child sexual abuse material online.\nMeta has shown recently that there is potential for a compromise that could improve child safety, at least to some extent. Instagram, described by the NSPCC recently as the platform most used for grooming, has developed a new tool  aimed at blocking the sending of sexual images to children \u2013 albeit, notably, authorities will not be alerted about those sending the material. \nThis would involve so-called client-side scanning which Meta believes undermines the chief privacy protecting feature of encryption \u2013 that only the sender and recipient know about the contents of messages. Meta has said it does report all apparent instances of child exploitation appearing on its site from anywhere in the world to NCMEC.\nOne compromise with the use of AI to detect offenders, suggests Lay, is a simple one: to ensure it can only be used under strict licence of child protection professionals with appropriate controls in place. It is not \u201ca silver bullet\u201d, he explained to me. AI-based ID will always need to be followed up by old fashioned police work but anything that can \u201cachieve in 15 seconds what we used to spend hours and hours trying to get\u201d is worthy of careful consideration, he believes.\nThe Ecuador operation, combining AI with traditional work, had an immediate impact in March. ICMEC reports that it led to a total of 115 victims (mainly girls and mostly aged six-12 and 13-15) and 37 offenders (mainly adult men) positively identified worldwide. Within three weeks, ICMEC said 18 international interventions had taken place, with 45 victims rescued and seven abusers arrested.\n\nOne way or another, a compromise needs to be struck to deal with this pandemic.\n\nChild sexual abuse is a global public health crisis that is steadily worsening thanks to advancing technologies which enable instantaneous production and limitless distribution of child exploitation material, as well as unregulated access to children online.\n\nThese are the words of Tasmanian, Grace Tame: a remarkable survivor of childhood abuse and executive director of the Grace Tame Foundation which works to combat the sexual abuse of children.\n\u201cLike countless child sexual abuse victim-survivors, my life was completely upended by the lasting impacts of trauma, shame, public humiliation, ignorance and stigma. I moved overseas at 18 because I became a pariah in my hometown, didn\u2019t pursue tertiary education as hoped, misused alcohol and drugs, self-harmed, and worked several minimum wage jobs\u201d. Tame believes that \u201ca centralised global research database is essential to safeguarding children\u201d.\nIf the internet and technology brought us to where we are today, the AI used in Quito to save 45 children is a powerful demonstration of the power of technology for good. Moreover, the work of the ten-country taskforce is testament to the potential of global responses to a global problem on an internet that knows no national boundaries.\nGreater collaboration, education, and in some cases regulation and legislation can all help, and they are needed without delay because, as Childlight\u2019s mantra goes, children can\u2019t wait.\n\n\nFor you: more from our Insights series:\n\nWhy people self-injure: \u2018You have no other voice \u2013 and no one would listen anyway\u2019\n\nMr Bates vs The Post Office depicts one of the UK\u2019s worst miscarriages of justice: here\u2019s why so many victims didn\u2019t speak out\n\nGP crisis: how did things go so wrong, and what needs to change?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s like being in a warzone\u2019 \u2013 A&E nurses open up about the emotional cost of working on the NHS frontline\n\n\nTo hear about new Insights articles, join the hundreds of thousands of people who value The Conversation\u2019s evidence-based news.

They have the technical attributes needed  for a nuclear plant, including  transmission infrastructure, cooling water capacity and a skilled workforce, the opposition policy says.\nThe program would consist of two phases, starting with two establishment projects in the mid-2030s followed by a build of others through to 2050.\nMost sites would have larger reactors, with two \u2013 in South Australia and Western Australia \u2013 having small modular reactors. All mainland states would eventually have reactors.\nThe proposed sites are\n\nLiddell Power Station, New South Wales \nMount Piper Power Station, New South Wales \nLoy Yang Power Stations, Victoria \nTarong Power Station, Queensland \nCallide Power Station, Queensland \nNorthern Power Station, South Australia (small modular reactor only) \nMuja Power Station, Western Australia (small modular reactor only)\n\n\n\n\nDutton said the generators would be owned by the Commonwealth government.\nThe first could begin operating in 2035 if small modular reactors are used, or 2037 \u201cif modern larger plants are found to be the best option\u201d, the opposition says.\nThis is much earlier than the CSIRO has estimated that an initial plant could begin. \nThe CSIRO said in its May assessment of generation technology costs for Australia, that \u201cdue to the current state of the development pipeline in Australia, that the earliest deployment would be from 2040\u201d.\nDutton said he would be \u201cvery happy for the election to be a referendum on energy, on nuclear, on power prices, on lights going out, on who has a sustainable pathway for our country going forward\u201d.\n\u201cWe are going to the next election seeking a mandate from the Australian people, a very clear mandate that we want support to modernise our energy system \u2026 which is about economic growth and jobs for decades and generations to come,\u201d Dutton said. said.\n\nThe opposition says  the timeline for nuclear  energy including  building two establishment projects is ten to 12 years, \u201cfrom the government making a decision until zero-emissions nuclear electricity first enters the grid\u201d. \nThe Coalition policy says a key advantage of the nuclear energy plants was they could be plugged into existing grids. \u201cThis means they can effectively replace retired or retiring coal plants and avoid much of the new spending needed for Labor\u2019s \u2018renewables-only\u2019 system, including new transmission poles and wires.\u201d \nThe government would partner with nuclear companies from aboard on development and operation.\nEach community around a site would receive a benefits package enshrined in legislation.\nIt would include:\n\nmulti-billion dollar facility guaranteeing high-paying jobs for generations to come\nan integrated economic development zone attracting manufacturing, value-add and high-tech industry\na regional deal unlocking investment in modern infrastructure, services and community priorities.\n\nEstablishing a civil nuclear programme would require an expanded Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency to license and regulate the power stations, a Nuclear Energy Coordinating Authority, and a government business enterprise to be called Affordable Energy Australia.\nDutton could not give a cost for the nuclear plan, saying only it would be \u201ca fraction\u201d of the government\u2019s energy transition plan costing $1.2 trillion to $1.5 trillion. He said the opposition would have more to say on cost \u201cin due course\u201d. \nThe opposition leader announced his plan at a news conference in Sydney, after a pre-budget announcement had been deferred. He was flanked by a bevy of colleagues including Nationals leader David Littleproud. \nTreasurer Jim Chalmers said in a social media post: \u201cWith Australia\u2019s advantages and opportunities, nothing could be more economically irrational or fiscally irresponsible\u201d than the nuclear policy\".\n\nChalmers told the ABC: \u201cPeter Dutton\u2019s nuclear negativity is economic insanity, pure and simple. Nuclear takes longer, it costs more and it will squander Australia\u2019s unique combination of advantages\u201d. \nApart from a fierce campaign from federal Labor, Dutton faces attacks from  the states. His plan is opposed by the Liberal-National opposition in Queensland where there is a state election within months. \nTony Wood, energy program director at the  Grattan Institute, said \nit was \u201cmore than strange that we have a Coalition proposal for public ownership while Labor is looking to drive private investment\u201d in the energy transition.\n\u201cThis proposal for nuclear energy is not a climate change policy and the opposition must be clear on what it plans are for the rest of the economy\u2019s emissions to meet net-zero by 2050,\u201d Wood said.\n\u201cAll our emissions targets are actually carbon budgets, so while Dutton is correct that it doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line reduction to 2050, all emissions that occur between now and then must come out of the carbon budget.\u201d\nHe said the opposition \u201chas not been clear on what sort of energy mix they see over the next 25 years. How will renewables figure and what about gas?\n\"The costs and timing are both very unclear, with no figures on the former and the prospect of a big gap in aligning the departure of coal with the arrival of nuclear\u201d.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Nuclear energy, Peter Dutton, nuclear plants","role":"assistant"}]}

Psychology research suggests people lie at least once a day.\nA 2006 review of 206 papers found that we are little better then chance at guessing whether something is a lie or not, 54% to be exact.\nSome lies are told to make others feel better. I wouldn\u2019t mind if someone wanted to tell me, \u201cYou\u2019re such a brilliant psychologist.\u201d Most lies however, are for the benefit of the person telling the lie.\nWe learn to lie young, typically between the ages of two and three. More successful lying in childhood takes a little longer and requires a more developed ability to understand others\u2019 mental states. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou also need good working memory to be convincing, so that you can remember the lie. Brighter children seem to lie most often and most selfishly. \nBy adulthood we are, it seems, well practised.\nThere are no tell-tale signs of lying per se, but there may be indicators of negative emotion associated with telling a lie (anxiety, guilt, shame, sadness, fear of being caught) even when the liar is trying to conceal them. \nThese sometimes leak out in micro-expressions, brief facial expressions lasting a fraction of a second or squelched expressions where the liar covers the emotion with a mask, usually a fake smile. \nYou can tell a fake smile because it doesn\u2019t involve the muscles around the eyes and leaves the face quickly. Genuine smiles fade more slowly.\nBut the thing about possible nonverbal indicators of deception is most of us would need to replay the behaviour in slow motion to spot them.\n\nFacing up to the truth\nBut what about avoiding eye contact, believed globally to be a deception cue. My mother always said that she could tell when I was lying because I couldn\u2019t look her in the eye. She would move closer and ask what I\u2019d been up to the night before. \nEye contact is not a useful indicator of deception. Eye contact is affected by our cognitive activity even when we\u2019re telling the truth. For instance, by planning our speech or accessing memory. \nAlso, we all know that\u2019s what people look out for. And liars know to control it. Good liars can maintain eye contact when lying by planning their lie in advance and building their lies on fragments of the truth and real situations. \nEye contact is also affected by interpersonal distance. It\u2019s difficult to maintain eye contact when someone is sitting close-up and staring at you (like my mother). This is the intimacy equilibrium model. \nCertain behaviours signal intimacy, like distance, eye contact and topic of conversation. If interpersonal distance changes, we balance this by unconsciously moderating the others. So when my mother moved in for the interrogation, I looked away and she got the evidence she was looking for.\nThis is a type of confirmation bias. It\u2019s not just that you look for evidence to confirm your hypothesis, you unconsciously influence the very behaviour you\u2019re looking for. \nThis doesn\u2019t just apply to my mother. A 1978 study suggested that police officers in interrogations move closer to suspects they think are guilty. The suspect looks away, and \u2026 guilty as charged! Observers don\u2019t notice the changed distance. \nBut confirmation bias isn\u2019t just about seating arrangement. We make instant and unconscious judgements of trustworthiness in a face quickly in everyday life (about one-tenth of a second). Once we\u2019ve decided that someone looks trustworthy, we may unconsciously search less for cues to deceit.\nLie detection is fraught with biases and good liars know how to exploit them. They know what we\u2019re looking out for and that\u2019s what they control. Good eye contact, masking smile, well-prepared speech with few hesitations. They can also convince themselves of the essential truth of the lie. Self-deceit reduces any emotional response.\nFor my new book Lies, Lying and Liars: A Psychological Analysis I studied many expert liars and how they use our intuition against us. For example, in judging a lie we need a baseline of behaviour to detect any deviations. \nExpert liars aim to disrupt this. One of my informants (with something to hide) said that when he was stopped by the police he pretended to be really angry and a bit unstable to throw them off course.\nAnd then there\u2019s personality. There\u2019s no point in searching for micro-expressions of guilt, shame, sadness, or fear, if that\u2019s not how they feel inside. Some people enjoy lying. It\u2019s exciting, they don\u2019t care about the consequences. Any micro-expressions in these cases will be positive.\nNot a bit of wonder expert liars feel emboldened.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Psychology, Liars, Intuition, Lies, Cognition, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Millions are likely to tune in to the leaders\u2019 special on June 20. The leaders of the country\u2019s four largest political parties by number of MPs (Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats and the SNP) will be quizzed by a studio audience.\nAt Cardiff University\u2019s School of Journalism, Media and Culture, we are conducting ongoing analysis of how guests have been chosen for the programme over the last decade. Our findings so far \u2013 published here for the first time \u2013 reveal that while the Question Time producers have broadly balanced the main political parties, they have frequently relied upon a small number of rightwing guests to provoke entertaining debates.\nLike most public service broadcasters worldwide, the BBC believes that impartiality is a core tenet of its approach to covering political debate. Coverage should be unbiased, balanced and objective, with no favouritism towards any side. This is monitored by the UK\u2019s media regulator, Ofcom, who can levy fines or even end a broadcaster\u2019s licence if impartiality rules are repeatedly flouted.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Ofcom has rules on broadcaster impartiality \u2013 so why is GB News getting away with breaking them?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test how this is applied to Question Time, our researchers compiled a dataset of all editions of the programme from September 2014 until July 2023 \u2013 a total of 352 programmes with 1,734 guest slots across the nine seasons, filled by 661 different people.\nThe programme\u2019s producers go to considerable lengths to provide panels with a representative view of British political life. During the timeframe of this study, there was never an all-male panel and rarely one that was entirely white. \nGiven the format of Question Time, it is not surprising to find that both Labour and Conservative politicians were well represented throughout the nine seasons.\n\nAmong the smaller parties, the SNP had a significant presence. This reflects its status as the ruling party in Scotland (though in coalition with the Scottish Greens between August 2021 and April 2024) and its position as the third-largest party in Westminster since the 2015 general election. \nThe Green party consistently appeared each season, although its appearances declined from a peak of five in 2015-16 to just one in 2021-22. This was despite its vote share growing to 2.7% in 2019. The Nigel Farage-led parties Ukip, the Brexit party and Reform UK also declined from a peak of 16 appearances in 2015-16 to just one in each of the last three seasons in the sample.\nMany guests made repeat appearances, with the political parties relying on panellists who shine in the combative atmosphere of Question Time. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet members Emily Thornberry and Lisa Nandy were most often featured. Perhaps surprisingly given some of the criticism of the show, in this timeframe, the Greens\u2019 former leader Caroline Lucas appeared more often than Farage. \n\nRemoving politicians from the list of most frequent guests shows that several high-frequency panellists are being used, most of whom come from the political right. The regularly featured journalists are typically opinion columnists who contribute to rightwing press outlets such as the Mail or the Telegraph, or who make appearances on right-leaning broadcasters like GB News and TalkTV. \nThe Spectator wields significant influence, with the top five most frequently used panellists all writing for the magazine. In contrast, there is no comparable influence from leftwing publications. The most frequently featured writers from the left were Novara Media\u2019s Ash Sarkar (six appearances) and former Guardian columnist Giles Fraser (five appearances).\n\nIn booking guests, the Question Time producers clearly consider both the show\u2019s public service nature \u2014 holding senior politicians to account \u2014 and the requirement to make the programme entertaining for a mass audience. The tendency to overuse panellists who write or broadcast for rightwing media outlets suggests an emphasis on heat over light.\nThe Question Time bias question\nQuestion Time has long been accused of bias towards both the left and right \u2013 usually a good indication of balance.\nBut the overuse of rightwing guests, as identified in our analysis, supports some of these claims of a lack of impartiality. The regular appearances of panellists such as Isabel Oakeshott and Julia Hartley-Brewer \u2013 the two most frequent non-politician guests in our analysis \u2013 raise questions about how producers choose guests.\nIt is worth pointing out that there is nothing wrong with the BBC inviting guests from these organisations, nor is there anything wrong with political writers from The Spectator discussing the political issues of the day. However, the lack of counterbalancing narratives from leftwing publications is notable. \nDebate programmes such as Question Time are subject to the same stringent rules on impartiality as news programmes. But academic research has tended to focus mostly on analysing impartiality in news bulletins. Our findings suggest that researchers should also pay attention to the balance on political debate programmes.\nThe commitment to due impartiality can indeed mean that impartiality occurs over time \u2013 but the evidence does not demonstrate Question Time is achieving this. Instead, it may be sacrificing the BBC\u2019s reputation for impartiality to create provocative programmes.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"UK politics, BBC, Question Time, Nigel Farage, Far right, Media bias, UK broadcasting, Rightwing, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

The trunk, which contains six muscle groups, is not only very strong \u2013 it can uproot a tree \u2013 but can be used with great precision. Elephants use a number of techniques to grasp objects, including suction, pinching with the two \u201cfingers\u201d at the tip of the trunk and wrapping the trunk around the object. \nResearcher Pauline Costes was part of a group of scientists who tested six female African savannah elephants in a zoo to see how much force their trunk tips exerted and which part of the trunk tip was strongest. She explains how these findings will be used to improve the ability of robots to grip and handle objects.\nWhat did you set out to study and why?\nIn this research project, we studied the maximum pinching force exerted by the tip of the trunk of African savannah elephants. The elephant\u2019s trunk is mainly composed of muscles, has no rigid structure (no bones), and has many nerves, giving it great power, precision and sensibility. \nPrevious studies have measured the force of the entire trunk when elephants wrap it around an object. We focused on how forceful the trunk tip is. The tip of an elephant\u2019s trunk comprises two finger-like protuberances: a pointy one at the top and a more rounded and shorter one underneath. We also studied how the position of the trunk influenced the force exerted by the elephant. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Fish fins are teaching us the secret to flexible robots and new shape-changing materials\n\n\n\n\nElectronic engineers who design robots have tried to mimic the flexibility and way in which natural biological tissue can twist or turn when it performs different tasks. This is known as bio-inspired technology. For the past 20 years, the elephant\u2019s trunk has inspired this research, especially in the robotics of grasping and manipulation. \nOur research aimed to find out how strong the trunk tip\u2019s pinching grasp is. This kind of grasping allows small objects to be picked up with high precision. This is particularly useful in soft robotics, which focuses on the design and manufacture of robots using flexible and deformable materials, inspired by biology.\nWhat were your key findings?\nWe measured a maximum pinch force of 86.4 Newton. A newton, the international unit for measuring force, corresponds to the force that gives a mass of one kilogram an acceleration of one metre per second squared. By comparison, the maximum pinch force between the thumb and index finger in humans is between 49 and 68 Newton.\nWe found that the trunk tip is used to grasp objects with high precision but without great force. This is useful information for the future development of the soft grippers of robots. Some robots have to be able to grasp objects if they are to carry out routine activities. Soft grippers \u2013 the tool on the end of the robot\u2019s arm \u2013 are the most important component of grasping.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How we made an octopus-inspired surgical robot using coffee\n\n\n\n\nSoft grippers based on the elephant\u2019s trunk also adapt to cluttered and unpredictable environments by reconfiguring their shape. In other words, they adapt their elastic bodies to the objects they interact with.\nMore research means better grippers. Here are a few examples of how soft robots can be used:\nMedicine: Use of robots for minimally invasive surgical procedures.\nIndustry: Handling fragile or irregularly shaped objects on production lines.\nResearch and exploration: Development of robots capable of navigating in difficult or inaccessible environments.\nAgriculture: Harvesting delicate fruit and vegetables without damaging them.\nWe also found a difference in force between the elephant\u2019s two \u201cfingers\u201d. This had never been studied before.  \nHow did you discover this?\nWe created a device to measure the pinching force of an elephant\u2019s trunk tip. This was a box fitted with two force sensors connected to an electronic system. The system recorded the force of the pinch and automatically released apples as a reward. \n\nAn apple was released when the elephant managed to pinch strongly enough to cross a predefined threshold. The trunk then had to pinch harder the next time to release the next apple. This was repeated until the elephants reached the maximum force they could manage.\nBy placing the sensors vertically and then horizontally on the box, we could see how the elephants would grip them in these different orientations. This showed us how the position of the trunk influences the force it exerts.\nThe equipment itself took us some time to set up and get the elephants ready for it through training. Tests were carried out with the sensors alone, then various prototypes of the box were tested until the final box was functional and fairly solid. After this initial test phase, conducted by several researchers of our team, I spent three months at the zoo to collect the data needed for this work.\nHow did your research benefit elephants?\nThe first direct benefit was keeping the captive elephants stimulated through enriching activities.\nOur research also examined how the trunk grasping techniques differ between different groups of elephants living in several habitats and the relationship with the density and size of the vegetation. This new knowledge is beneficial for elephant conservation, helping scientists to figure out how climate change, which changes elephant habitats, will affect their feeding behaviour.\nThe research was carried out in collaboration between France\u2019s MECADEV and ISYEB research units at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, the Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle and ZooParc de Beauval.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Robotics, Natural world, Bio-inspired","role":"assistant"}]}

Often, transit agencies are unable to provide additional buses because population density in such areas is usually low.\nOn-demand transit (ODT) is an innovative transportation approach that enhances the accessibility and quality of service while reducing operating costs.\nDespite the rapid growth of ODT services in various cities across Canada and the United States, the mechanism of placing ride-requests with many ODT service providers remains reliant on mobile applications, telephone calls or websites. \nBut privacy concerns may lead passengers to be reluctant to use mobile applications for booking a ride. And individuals without access to phones face barriers in accessing these services. \n\n\n\n\n\nReal-time information\nOur research investigates the potential of ODT by simulating a novel configuration that uses smart devices installed at bus stops. Smart City Network (SCiNe) devices are used for local communication with passengers that also provide them with real-time information. Prototypes of SCiNe devices, developed by BusPas, Inc., have been installed at bus stops in Montr\u00e9al and Laval, Qu\u00e9.\n\nSCiNe devices provide useful information, such as estimated arrival time, potential delays and the number of passengers on transit services. Providing such real-time information can improve passenger satisfaction while enabling transit agencies to make data-driven decisions that optimize operations.\nWith such a proposed configuration, passengers at a bus stop equipped with a SCiNe use the device to request a ride. Upon receiving a request from the passenger, each SCiNe sends the transit agency information, including bus stop location, request time and destination location. \nThe agency also receives real-time data from the fleet of vehicles, mainly vans, travelling across the network. This data allows it to be continuously aware of the status of vehicles in terms of availability, current position, requested locations and routes. \nOptimizing schedules and routes\nThe real-time data received from vehicles and SCiNes are transmitted to the dispatching algorithm. \nThe dispatching algorithm is responsible for dynamically matching passengers to available vehicles by taking different parameters into account such as wait and detour times. The algorithm also considers how two or multiple requests can be addressed simultaneously. \nWhen allocating rides to passengers, the algorithm considers vehicle availability, the proximity of passenger location and the expected duration of the trip. Once a vehicle is assigned to a passenger, the algorithm determines the optimal route for the vehicle to reach them. In order to select the best route, it takes real-time traffic conditions, distance and estimated travel time into account.\nThe dispatching algorithm assigns vehicles to passengers, and passengers receive personalized information through the SCiNes, which includes the estimated waiting time. Vehicles also receive information on the passengers who need to be picked up and the bus stop locations.\nImplementing on-demand services\nThe proposed configuration was implemented to simulate ODT service for the first-mile, which is the initial leg of a commuter\u2019s journey. Terrebonne, a suburb of Montr\u00e9al, was selected as the study area, and the proposed ODT service was compared with the existing bus transit service operating there.\nOur simulation results suggest that if such an ODT service were available, transit users would result in reduced travel times compared to using a regular bus service. ODT streamlines getting around on public transit, making travel quicker and smoother.\nWere such a system to be developed and adopted on a large scale, ODT could have a big impact on the organization and performance of suburban transit provision. Using innovative technologies, such as SCiNe devices and sophisticated dispatching algorithms, ODT offers a potential method to improve accessibility, reduce commute times and enhance the overall experience of transit users.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Bus, Quebec, Transportation, Suburbs, Montreal, Bus services, Public transit, On-demand public transit","role":"assistant"}]}

One of the first places it should look is the distribution of federal funding.\nCouncils in remote locations rely heavily on grants.\nWhereas a typical council in a city maintains a road network of about 600 kilometres over an area of 100 square kilometres, the Central Desert Regional Council in the Northern Territory has to maintain more than 1,700 kilometres, spread over 280,000 square kilometres.\n\nManaging a massive road network is costly, as is providing services such as collecting bins and spraying weeds when residents are spread far and wide.\nAnd remote councils find it harder than city councils to meet these costs. The Central Desert Regional Council has a population of just 4,000, compared to 100,000 for a typical suburban council.\nHigh costs, low incomes\nFewer residents means fewer ratepayers to tax. The typical city council is able to raise nearly 90% of what it needs from rates and other fees. Remote councils raise less than half.\nAnd remote councils can\u2019t bring in income from other sources in the way that city councils can. It\u2019s harder to charge for parking in Tennant Creek than in Sydney. \nSo remote councils rely on grants to make up the rest.\nBut there\u2019s a problem: some states have more high-needs councils than others.\n\n\n\nIn New South Wales and Victoria, less than 1% of the population lives in remote areas, whereas in Western Australia it\u2019s 6% and in the Northern Territory 40%.  \nIt would make sense for federal government grants for councils to reflect this, but they don\u2019t reflect it much.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s program of Financial Assistance Grants hands out more than A$3 billion of grants for councils each year. \nThere are two kinds of grants: general grants (about two-thirds) and roads grants. Separate grants from the Roads to Recovery program are allocated in the same way as roads grants. \nRemote councils get less in the NT than NSW\nFor all three types of grants, the money is first divided between the states and territories, which then award grants to councils based on a set of principles.\nBut the general grants are divided between the states and territories on the basis of population.\nThis means NSW, which has fewer high-needs councils, gets just as much per person as the Northern Territory, which has many high-needs councils.\nBecause many NSW councils are almost self-sufficient, NSW is able to direct more of what it gets to the small number of councils with high needs. \nStates with more high-needs councils have to spread what they get more thinly.\nThe resulting disparity is stark: remote councils in South Australia get just one-quarter of the funding per resident that remote councils in NSW get. Remote councils in the Northern Territory get less than one-sixth.\n\n\n\nAnother problem is that the formula governing roads grants and Roads to Recovery grants is opaque and hard to understand. The reasoning behind it has been lost in the mists of time. It might date back to 1981 or even earlier. \nIt doesn\u2019t take account of any changes to the road networks over the past 40 years.\nCouncils should be funded on the basis of need\nThis isn\u2019t how the federal government normally distributes funds. \nRevenue from the goods and services tax is distributed to states and territories in accordance with need. \nEach year the Commonwealth Grants Commission uses up-to-date data to work out how expensive it is to provide the services each state needs and how much each state can raise itself.\nCommonwealth funding for councils should be allocated in the same sort of way: on the basis of the needs of the councils and their ability to meet them.\nThe new inquiry presents an opportunity to put things right. \n\nDominic Jones and Natasha Bradshaw are co-authors of Grattan Institute\u2019s 2023 report, Potholes and Pitfalls: How to fix local roads.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Local government, Infrastructure, Road funding, Better Cities","role":"assistant"}]}

Ann Kaplan famously described mothers in cinema as \u201can absent presence\u201d \u2013 background figures that might facilitate the narrative but who are rarely, if ever, its focus.\nI am palpably reminded of this watching the opening scenes of Mahalia Belo\u2019s assured debut feature film The End We Start From. \nSkilfully adapted by Alice Birch from Megan Hunter\u2019s 2017 novella, the film opens in the bathroom of a London townhouse. \nThe headless torso of the heavily pregnant unnamed woman (the excellent Jodie Comer) potters in the background, chattering to her off-screen partner (Joel Fry). Steam from a running bath slowly clouds the camera lens. The sounds of rushing water drown the woman out until she is silenced.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe End We Start From is an ecological disaster story set in a near-future London besieged by floods, so it is unsurprising the film opens with this watery submersion. \nNonetheless, it is hard not to read the scene as a nod to the long cinematic history of erasing mothers. Belo sets this tradition up only to tear it back down in her insistence on viewing the cataclysmic events through the eyes of a new mother.\n\nMotherhood as catastrophe\nCentring a survival story on a new mother has its roots in mainstream portrayals of motherhood as difficult and depleting. \nPopular culture is rife with discussions of mothers who feel they have \u201clost themselves\u201d in their new maternal role. \nThe film begins dramatically, pairing the breaking of the woman\u2019s waters with the heavy deluge pounding London. The sequence crosscuts between closeups of Comer\u2019s face and disorientating angles of rising water levels, reaching a crescendo as the baby\u2019s head crowns at the exact moment flood waters erupt through the windows and doors of the couple\u2019s home.\nDespite the small budget and limited special effects, the moment packs a wallop. In pairing motherhood with mother nature, the film depicts birth as both a beginning and an end, a seismic event that, however ordinary, feels biblical in scale.\nReproduction has long featured in dystopian texts as a metaphor for exploring anxieties around technological interventions, threats to human agency, and the creeping eradication of personal freedoms.  \nBut mothers themselves have been demonstrably absent. \nFrequently dead, appearing only in memories and dreams as per Cormac McCarthy\u2019s apocalyptic novel The Road (2006) or even Margaret Atwood\u2019s feminist dystopia The Handmaid\u2019s Tale (1985), critics have argued mothers in speculative fiction are little more than \u201cempty spaces or hollowed out characters\u201d.\nIn a reversal of this trope, the absent father-figure haunts The End We Start From, seen only in flickering glimpses by the mother at the centre.\nThe film is part of a growing dystopian subgenre of \u201cmaternal cli-fi\u201d seeking to upend this tradition of absent mothers. Other examples include Clare Moleta\u2019s novel Unsheltered (2021), Diane Cook\u2019s novel The New Wilderness (2020), and the Australian TV series The Commons (2019).\n\nThese works depict characters navigating worlds ravaged by climate change and environmental disaster. Not surprisingly, climate fiction has experienced a surge in popularity as events like the 2022 Auckland floods and Australian bushfires render the seemingly unimaginable frighteningly real.\nWhat distinguishes maternal cli-fi from climate fiction more broadly is its use of motherhood as a narrative strategy to raise ethical questions about the future of the world and our place in it.\nIs it OK to still have children?\nIn the face of profound environmental precarity and an uncertain global future, many women are questioning whether or not to have children at all. \nUp to 60% of millennial and gen Z women cite global warming as a key factor when considering parenthood, while one in three Australian women under the age 30 say they are reconsidering having (more) children due to climate anxiety. \nMaternal cli-fi takes these fears seriously, personalising the global and bringing the world\u2019s crises closer to home. \n\nAs many modern mothers will attest, motherhood lends itself well to ambivalence and uncertainty, often manifesting in guilt, doubt and second-guessing.\nAlthough tempting to dismiss maternal cli-fi as depressing and grim, The End We Start From also finds pleasure in unexpected places. Scenes between mother and infant are intimate and bodily, bathed in chiaroscuro lighting to create an embryonic cocoon at odds with the environmentally ravaged society-on-the-brink. \nFurther reprieve from the simmering violence comes via the woman\u2019s burgeoning friendship with another new mum (an effervescent Katherine Waterston), providing solace and support.\nThe End We Start From does not answer whether we should continue to have children in a world where our future is anything but guaranteed. \nInstead, this tender, fierce film seeks to excavate the mother from her place of erasure and remind us of the ethical potential of the maternal point of view. \nBelo has described how motherhood prompted her to view \u201cthe world slightly differently\u201d \u2013 a perspective maternal cli-fi implores us to share.\nThe End We Start From is now streaming on Apple TV.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, New Zealand, Motherhood, Screen, Apple TV, Cli-Fi","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nA number of theories are being touted in South Africa about why and how former president Jacob Zuma retains his appeal as a leader. And why the party he formed  \u2013 uMkhonto we Sizwe \u2013 to contest the recent elections managed to get 14.58% of the vote in the national elections and 45.35% in the provincial elections in KwaZulu-Natal to become the largest party in that province. This just over five months after its launch.\nBut all the conjecture and explanations need to be treated with extreme caution: this is because nobody knows. Based on my five decades immersed in South African politics as a sociologist, I would argue that there is no easy explanation for the uMkhonto we Sizwe Party\u2019s unexpected success or Zuma\u2019s enduring popular appeal.\nThere was similar dissonance 14 years ago when Zuma defeated the then African National Congress (ANC) president, Thabo Mbeki, at a watershed party conference in December 2007. I analysed what one senior leader called the \u201cZuma tsunami\u201d and how the event was being interpreted by the media, academics and thinking politicians themselves. I identified eight often contradictory and sometimes overlapping explanations of the phenomenon. \nAt the time, the lack of consensus amounted to total confusion. And a fear that South Africa was confronting an abyss. \n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar levels of apprehension accompany commentary on the role being played by Zuma and his uMkhonto weSizwe Party (MK Party) today. This requires deciphering.\nMy initial survey of the media suggests five ways in which this is being interpreted.\nZuma as South Africa\u2019s Donald Trump\nThe first theme running through much analysis is what we might term \u201cJacob Zuma as Donald Trump\u201d, the former US president who is prepared to cause political mayhem to keep himself out of jail. \nThis suggests that, fearing the end of the road after constantly appealing adverse court decisions to avoid prosecution for corruption, Zuma has played an ace in a deadly game of poker with the ANC.\nWhereas Trump has captured the machinery and followership of the Republican Party from within, Zuma claims MK Party is essentially the true ANC which has been betrayed by those who ejected him from the presidency in 2018. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Trump and Zuma: worlds apart but bound by patriarchy and sexism\n\n\n\n\nTrump claims the 2020 election in the United States was rigged by Joe Biden and shadowy \u201cdeep state\u201d political elites. Zuma depicts the Electoral Commission of South Africa as having fixed the 2024 election in favour of the ANC to keep President Cyril Ramaphosa in power. \nTrump threatens that his being sent to jail following his recent conviction as a felon would lead to a popular uprising. Zuma warns obliquely that any attempt to prevent MK Party from assuming power in KwaZulu-Natal would lead to violence.\nAll this and much more, as parallels between Trump and Zuma are reiterated. For added spice, Trump\u2019s personal antagonism to Biden is matched by Zuma\u2019s anger with Ramaphosa for displacing him.\nEthnicity\nA second major theme running through much analysis is that MK Party\u2019s unexpectedly strong performance can be explained by Zuma\u2019s appeal to Zulu \u201cnationalism\u201d, or \u201cethnicity\u201d. \nThis territory is a conceptual swamp. Zuma\u2019s popularity and MK Party\u2019s strong performance in KwaZulu-Natal indicate that they have successfully appealed to aspects of Zulu culture, history and exceptionalism to get support from ordinary people in the province. Just as the late Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the Inkatha Freedom Party did before them. \nBut there are always pitfalls in any reference to ethnicity.\nKey among these is the problem of who has \u201cethnicity\u201d and who does not. An implicit suggestion often being that Africans have it, and white people do not. As with other terms which are often bandied about to explain the popularity of political individuals feared by liberal elites, notably \u201cpopulism\u201d and \u201ccharisma\u201d, using it too loosely exhausts its explanatory power. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      South Africa elections: Zuma\u2019s MK Party steals the ANC's thunder with provocative rhetoric and few clear policies\n\n\n\n\nIn short, if we want to use \u201cethnicity\u201d as an explanation for Zuma\u2019s popularity in KwaZulu-Natal, we need to explain why he appeals to some Zulus and not others.\nEqually, we need to explain why Zuma remains popular among segments of the electorate across the nation, far beyond the boundaries of KwaZulu-Natal. This can hardly be ascribed to \u201cethnicity\u201d. \nCoalition of the aggrieved\nThe third suggestion sees uMkhonto weSizwe\u2019s rise as the product of a \u201ccoalition of the aggrieved\u201d: those who have felt sidelined by the Ramaphosa government\u2019s policies. \nWhen Zuma was elected party leader, the trade union federation Cosatu and the South African Communist Party, driven by their opposition to Mbeki\u2019s \u201cneo-liberal\u201d economic policies, joined hands with aspirant entrepreneurial elites who felt that they had been excluded from the fruits of black economic empowerment. \nIn the 2024 election, Zuma\u2019s coalition of support is said to have drawn heavily from those who were fingered as involved in corruption by the Zondo Commission, which probed state capture. They may have lost state contracts or fear prosecution.\nContracts\nHence follows a closely related fourth proposition. This is the notion that just as Zuma used his position as president to loot the state, shadowy players behind the MK Party back it to secure control over the provincial machinery. This, so it can allocate contracts and political goods in their favour. \nAt the head of the queue are the mafias which have gained prominence in key sectors of the provincial economy, notably in transport and construction. Hence MK Party likely gaining support from lobbyists for the coal industry. And its advocacy of South Africa\u2019s further embrace of nuclear power. If pursued, these would offer multiple opportunities for the dishing out of subsidiary contracts to those close to the seats of power.\nAn attack on the constitution\nFinally, fifthly, there is the notion that Zuma\u2019s and uMkhonto weSizwe\u2019s policy platforms embody an attack on the constitution and constitutionalism. \nI observed in my analysis of the \u201cZuma tsunami\u201d that Zuma\u2019s ascendancy had opened Pandora\u2019s box. It gave rise to a style and content of politics which was not merely vulgar and disrespectful of ANC traditions, but  explicitly dangerous to democracy. It appealed to a social conservatism which  was hostile to the values of the constitution. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The two faces of Jacob Zuma \u2013 former South African president campaigns to unseat the ANC he once led. Who supports him and why?\n\n\n\n\nLinked to this is a notion of Zuma himself as politically unprincipled and cynically disposed to exploit his popular appeal for personal ends. Nadine Gordimer, the South African writer who won the Nobel prize for literature in 1991, informed us that when she saw Zuma performing, she was reminded of Hitler in the beerhall.\nThe urgency\nWhat follows from all this is that there is no easy single explanation of Zuma\u2019s political renaissance and the appearance of the uMkhonto weSizwe Party as a potential spoiler and powerful player in South African politics. It is going to take time and careful analysis to understand it, to dissect it, and to unravel its significance. \nMany will agree that Zuma and his party constitute a clear and present danger to South African democracy. However, at the same time, we must seek to understand why Zuma and his party have attracted as much support as they have.\nToday, much interpretation of Trump\u2019s popularity relies on notions of alienation, his exploitation of the fears and hopes of decent, ordinary, albeit socially conservative, people who have been left behind by the rapidly changing nature of America\u2019s capitalist economy. \nLikewise, understanding Zuma\u2019s enduring popular appeal requires probing why he gathers so much support from poor and unemployed South Africans. This despite the convincing evidence accumulated by the commission of inquiry into state capture that he presided over an era of unprecedented looting of the South African state which was contrary to their material interests.\nThat there is no easy explanation for uMkhonto weSizwe\u2019s unexpected success underlines the urgency of trying harder to understand it.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Jacob Zuma, Donald Trump, Poker, Populism, tenderpreneurs, KwaZulu-Natal, Umkhonto we Sizwe, Ethnicity, Charisma, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Inkatha, Neo-liberal, Stalingrad strategy, Zulu culture, South Africa election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

These sequences, known as human endogenous retroviruses (or Hervs), date back hundreds of thousands to millions of years \u2013 with some even predating the emergence of Homo sapiens. \nOur latest research suggests that some ancient viral DNA sequences in the human genome play a role in susceptibility to psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.\nHervs represent the remnants of these infections with ancient retroviruses. Retroviruses are viruses that insert a copy of their genetic material into the DNA of the cells they infect. Retroviruses probably infected us on multiple occasions during our evolutionary past. When these infections occurred in sperm or egg cells that generated offspring, the genetic material from these retroviruses was passed on to subsequent generations, becoming a permanent part of our lineage. \nInitially, scientists considered Hervs to be \u201cjunk DNA\u201d \u2013 parts of our genome with no discernible function. But as our understanding of the human genome has advanced, it\u2019s become evident that this so-called junk DNA is responsible for more functions than originally hypothesised.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, researchers found that Hervs can regulate the expression of other human genes. A genetic feature is said to be \u201cexpressed\u201d if its DNA segment is used to produce RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules. These RNA molecules can then serve as intermediaries leading to the production of specific proteins, or help to regulate other parts of the genome. \nInitial research suggested that Hervs regulate the expression of neighbouring genes with important biological functions. One example of this is a Herv that regulates the expression of a gene involved in modifying connections between brain cells. \nHervs have also been found to produce RNAs and even proteins in blood and brain samples. These molecules have the potential to exert a wide range of functions, as they can travel across cellular compartments to execute different roles. \nScientists have also found evidence suggesting certain human genes are derived from Hervs. This indicates there were instances during evolution where Hervs were co-opted for specialised biological functions. For example, the human genes syncytins 1 and 2, which are derived from Hervs, play pivotal roles in placental development.\nHERVs in psychiatric disorders\nConsidering the abundance of Hervs in the genome and their potentially numerous functions, we wanted to better understand whether genetic susceptibility to certain psychiatric disorders was associated with differences in Herv expression.\n\nIn our study, we profiled Herv expression in nearly 800 autopsy brain samples. This helped us identify DNA variations that influenced Herv expression in the brain. \nWe then cross-referenced this information with findings from large genetic studies which had compared genetic differences between tens of thousands of people \u2013 both with and without mental health conditions. These studies identified variations in DNA associated with different psychiatric conditions. \nWe found that that the expression of four Hervs was linked with genetic susceptibility to major psychiatric disorders. The expression of two of these Hervs was associated with schizophrenia, one Herv with both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and one with depression. These results suggest that Hervs may be playing a more important role in the brain than initially thought.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Discovering how genetic 'dark matter' plays a role in mental illness is just the tip of the iceberg for human health\n\n\n\n\nThere are many genes involved in psychiatric disorders \u2013 and Hervs are only a part of this puzzle. Although the precise impact of these Hervs on brain cells and on a person\u2019s susceptibility to certain psychiatric disorders requires further research, our study is the first to show that genetic susceptibility for a psychiatric disorder also acts through these ancient viral DNA sequences.  \nIt\u2019s still too early to determine the practical applications of our findings \u2013 and whether they might be used to develop new treatments. But we\u2019re optimistic about this line of research. By linking Herv expression in the brain with psychiatric disorders, our research recognises the importance of these mysterious sequences in the human genome, which have been ignored for years.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"DNA, Schizophrenia, Depression, Bipolar disorder, Retroviruses, Psychiatric disorders, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Most of the men who etched these arborglyphs into the living trees were Basques who, starting with the Gold Rush of the 1840s, had immigrated from the Basque Country that straddles the Pyrenees Mountains.\nOur experience of documenting arborglyphs \u2013 \u201clertxun-marrak\u201d in Basque \u2013 has deepened over time. At first, we simply tried to decipher what was on the tree. It can be hard to tell what is scarred bark and what is a carving. Gradually, we got better at deciphering the carvings and now hope to spot the oldest and most ornate.\n\nWe also came to appreciate the different styles and themes, like in signatures and writing. One herder carves his name, the date and his hometown; another delves into politics; and another carves a hoped-for female companion.\nViewing the decades-old carvings, we\u2019re surrounded by the quiet and solitude of the high mountain range, whether in the Sierra Nevada, Ruby Mountains or Sawtooth Mountains. We literally stand in the footsteps of the herder who created the arborglyph. \nThese herders left their marks on the aspens, and now we are part of a research collaboration that aims to document and catalog as many of their arborglyphs and the experiences they record as possible before they disappear. About 25,000 arborglyphs have been documented over time, and there are likely at least as many more left to be recorded before they\u2019re lost.\n\nWho were the sheepherders who left their mark?\nBeginning almost 200 years ago, Basques emigrated to the American West to pursue economic opportunities, escape compulsory military service or political persecution, and for other personal reasons. Most were lower class, from agrarian backgrounds, with little to no education or English language skills. As the sheepherding industry grew in the West, it offered these immigrants steady work, and Basques became synonymous with sheepherding through the 1970s, when the economy improved in the Basque Country. \nThe Basque immigrants practiced a seasonal form of herding called transhumance. The herders trailed the sheep up into the high mountains during the spring and summer for grazing, then migrated in the fall back to the valleys where they spent the winter. This annual cycle meant Basque herders spent their summers alone in the hills.\nIn Basque, Spanish, French and English, they carved into living aspen trees to express their thoughts, dreams, wishes and challenges. Their arborglyphs cover a spectrum of topics: their hometowns, sports, women, love, work, religion, politics and more.\n\nFor example, they carved political slogans like \u201cGora Euskadi\u201d (\u201cUp with the Basque Country\u201d), for which they could have been arrested at home. There are carvings of crosses that note the festivals of particular saints, boats depicted by those who hailed from fishing villages, and well-known verses and poems about longing to return to their country.\nSometimes you laugh when you get the joke or the saying that they share. Other times, it can be quite moving as they describe their lives and longings. These carvings reflect a variety of human emotions and experiences, with nostalgia playing a prominent role.\nCollecting the carvings virtually\nTo document these disappearing cultural artifacts, we formed Lertxun-Marrak \u2013 The Arborglyph Collaborative, composed of Boise State University, California State University, Bakersfield, and the University of Nevada, Reno in collaboration with the Kern County Museum, the Basque Museum, and the Northeastern Nevada Museum, with the support of the National Historical Publications & Records Commission.\n\nWe also want to make connections with those who were interested in the carvings: family and friends of those who left the Basque Country for opportunities in the American West; those from local communities who wish to understand the experience of these immigrants; artists who see the aspen trees as a canvas and the carvings as a distinct art; researchers and governmental organizations, hikers, hunters and runners who come upon them in the backcountry, and the greater public.\nUnfortunately, age, grazing practices, more frequent and intense fires, and climate change as a whole threaten these carvings. The Arborglyph Collaborative aims to document as many tree carvings as possible before they are gone.\nTo do so, we follow the herders\u2019 trails through the mountains. It\u2019s easy to walk through an aspen grove and not realize that the bark of the trees are canvases. Having an understanding of the sheepherding area helps us identify groves where herders carved on the aspens. Mature aspen groves with springs close to them are better candidates to contain \u201clertxun-marrak.\u201d If we find one arborglyph, we can assume that there will be others, since they are usually found in groups in areas with heavy sheepherding traffic.\nThe techniques used to capture and reproduce tree carvings have evolved along with the available technologies. The Earl Collection of tree carving rubbings, deposited at the Jon Bilbao Basque Library at the University of Nevada, Reno, represents one example of the early efforts.\n\nReno residents Jean and Phillip Earl first heard about arborglyphs during a lecture at the university in the 1970s. Intrigued, they began to actively seek out what they first termed \u201cliving galleries\u201d and to experiment with methods of preserving the images they found; muslin and black rubbing wax proved the best tools for the job. The Earls devoted 40 years to developing an archival record comprising around 150 rubbings of the carvings that most captured their attention because of their visual appeal. \nAlong with rubbings, researchers used sketching, still photography and, later, video recordings to document the etched bark of aspens. Another research collection in the Jon Bilbao Basque Library was compiled by one of the first scholars interested in arborglyphs, Joxe Mallea-Olaetxe. In fact, he coined the term lertxun-marrak \u2013 literally, \u201clines\/drawings on aspen trees,\u201d the name for arborglyphs in Euskara, the Basque language.\nFrom the 1970s to the 2000s, he documented thousands of arborglyphs, including detailed descriptions, photographs and video recordings, providing a comprehensive view of these cultural artifacts.\n\nNow, we are able to document the arborglyphs with photogrammetry, which creates a three-dimensional model in realistic detail. We\u2019re also able to recreate the carving and its setting in virtual reality, allowing a visitor to immerse themselves in a grove without needing to travel. Smartphones and tablets make it convenient for nearly anyone to engage with arborglyphs from anywhere, at any time, including creating and accessing 3D models of the carvings.\n\nThe trees and the Basques\n\nThe need to preserve these human experiences transformed into artifacts is driven home by encounters like one that happened on a recent documenting trip in the mountains outside of Idaho City, Idaho. One student who was helping take photos and videos and noting GPS locations revealed that her father came to the U.S. from the Basque Country to work as a sheepherder. She\u2019d joined our research team to learn more about his experience. When she found the carvings made by her dad, who had died when she was young, tears ran down her cheeks as she experienced a flood of emotions.\nStories like this demonstrate the value of preserving these artifacts that revive the voices and memories of these immigrants in the American West. Today, increased technological availability and reliable partners are key to achieving this goal. We have much more work to do, more arborglyphs to collect, ways to make them publicly accessible, and more communities to engage with.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Basque Country, 3D modelling, Herding, Sierra Nevada, Photogrammetry, Herders","role":"assistant"}]}

One of the central reasons for this breakdown in trust is the widespread popular belief that some politicians have made a practice of lying to the public. Research published in 2022 showed the British public overwhelmingly wanted lying politicians to face consequences.\nAnd while the UK\u2019s general election is grabbing the headlines, a proposal in Wales\u2019 Senedd (Welsh parliament) is seeking to address this issue by introducing new legislation that would criminalise politicians who lie. If passed, Wales would become the first country in the world to introduce criminal sanctions for lying politicians.\nThe proposals are being led by the former leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price, who has described a \u201ccredibility gap\u201d in UK politics as a \u201cgaping chasm\u201d. Price has pushed for such changes since the mid-2000s when he campaigned for the impeachment of Tony Blair over the war in Iraq. \nPrice tried and failed to introduce an offence for politicians who lie when laws were passed in May expanding the size of the Senedd. But a cross-party committee has now voted in favour of Price\u2019s proposals, and they are being considered for incorporation into the new elections and elected bodies (Wales) bill instead. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the proposals it would be a criminal offence for a member of the Senedd, or a candidate for election to the Senedd, to wilfully, or with intent to mislead, make or publish a statement that is known to be false or deceptive. Proceedings would have to be brought within six months from the date on which the statement was made. \nIt would be considered a defence if it could be \u201creasonably inferred\u201d to be a statement of opinion, or if it were retracted with an apology within 14 days. Being prosecuted for such a law would disqualify a person from being a Senedd member.\nThe proposals are not yet law, and the bill has further debate stages yet to go. Price\u2019s amendment is supported by Plaid Cymru, the Welsh Conservatives and the Welsh Liberal Democrats. \nBut so far the amendment does not have the support of the Welsh Labour government and ministers may attempt to have it removed. The Welsh counsel general (similar to the UK government\u2019s attorney general), Mick Antoniw, has said he supports the \u201cgeneral principle,\u201d but is concerned that the amendment \u201camounts to little more than bad and ineffective law.\u201d\nThere are also broader concerns about whether the Senedd has the ability under Wales\u2019s devolved powers to make such a law. While Wales can pass laws in respect of the operations of the Senedd, legally speaking there are problems when it comes to straying into the realms of criminal offences. In this instance it is unlikely the Senedd would be able to expressly create a criminal offence such as this.\nThe Senedd may find itself in territory akin to what Scotland experienced when the UK government blocked Scotland\u2019s gender recognition bill. In January 2023, the UK government invoked section 35 of the Scotland Act to veto proposals designed to make it easier for people to change their legal gender, on the grounds they would affect equality law for the whole of the UK. \nIs such a law necessary?\nThe Welsh ministerial code already exists and is meant to uphold the standards of constitutional and personal conduct of ministers. The Senedd has an independent standards commissioner, who is an \u201cimpartial provider of advice on any matter of principle relating to conduct of members of the Senedd\u201d. \nBut the commissioner doesn\u2019t deal with complaints relating to the actions of the Welsh government and ministers carrying out Welsh government business. Nor do they investigate issues relating to the performance of Senedd members. The standards commissioner\u2019s website states that this is because: \u201cIssues relating to performance of the member of the Senedd in his or her role is essentially a matter for the electorate at the ballot box.\u201d\nThere are also the Nolan principles which apply to those elected or appointed to public office across the UK. They include the principles of \u201cintegrity\u201d, \u201copenness\u201d and \u201chonesty\u201d.\n\nThe problem with the current regime is a lack of enforcement. Beyond accountability to the electorate during elections, there are very few repercussions when politicians mislead the public. This is helping to fuel a mistrust of politicians, and casting doubt over what can be believed.\nLaws may be a stepping stone to restoring trust and facilitating enforceability in a different way, and with legal safeguards. In terms of standards, it would bring politicians more into line with what is expected from other professions, such as lawyers and doctors. Of course, members of these professions aren\u2019t criminalised unless they explicitly break the law, but they are held to account if they fail to maintain certain standards and can be struck off as a result. \nPolitically speaking, while the Welsh government could seek to remove anti-lying amendments at future debates, that would do little to signal trust in those elected to public office. In fact, it could prove to be even more damaging. \nThis issue is likely to shine a spotlight on the constitutional devolved competence of the Senedd itself. But trust in politics is a UK-wide issue. While some politicians are trying to put a sticking plaster over the wound, the new UK government will need to work with all devolved administrations to take more significant steps to rebuild trust.  \nIt\u2019s a bleak indictment of democracy that a law reminding politicians not to lie is even being considered. But a culture change in politics is evidently needed.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Law, Politics, Crime, Labour, Lying, Tony Blair, Devolution, Wales, UK government, Politicians, Plaid Cymru, Welsh politics, Senedd, Welsh devolution, Trust in politics, Welsh Conservatives, Welsh Labour, Welsh government, Welsh law, Educate me, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Pharaoh, at the National Gallery of Victoria, is outstanding for its scope, scale and presentation. \nIt is the greatest exhibition of ancient Egyptian art we have ever seen in Australia. \nThe exhibition comes from the British Museum, holder of the largest and most comprehensive collection of Egyptian antiquities outside the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Over 500 items have been selected, including monumental sculptures, tomb and temple architecture, coffins, papyri, funerary objects and an extensive display of jewellery. \nNumerically, this is the largest (and heaviest) touring exhibition ever mounted by the British Museum and it is the largest exhibition of ancient Egyptian art ever shown in Australia. The effective dramatic display, designed by Peter King who treats the whole space as a cycle from dawn to dusk, occupies all of the major downstairs exhibition spaces at NGV International.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe functionality of art\nFor a civilisation that left such a huge artistic heritage, it is sobering to remember the ancient Egyptian language had no word for \u201cart\u201d. \nArt was something functional that gave permanence to the objects of this world, so they could continue to serve their owners in the next life. Much of the surviving ancient Egyptian art is tomb art, designed to withstand the test of time and to preserve in an idealised form the beauty of balance, order and harmony, while celebrating the absolute power of the pharaoh.\n\nWhat is it about ancient Egyptian art that holds us spellbound? In part, it is the sense of sublime beauty, its permanence, with forms seemingly unchanging over millennia, its antiquity and its state of preservation. More than anything else it is the fact that it is permeated by a sense of magic, somehow meant to overcome the forces of death. \nWhen a person died, they were mummified and engaged in a ritual involving an interaction with the \u201cka\u201d (life force) and the \u201cba\u201d (human essence). They were surrounded by what we could think of as art objects that involved magic spells, magic amulets and protective deities. \n\nWhat struck me about this exhibition was this sense of spirituality \u2013 the mystical otherness. We are presented with a variety of beautiful objects across seven thematic categories. Each section, in a way, comments on the role of the pharaoh in Egyptian life. \nThe elaborate and the intimate\nIn an exhibition of this nature, there are a number of memorable objects: the granodiorite Head of a colossal statue, probably King Amenemhat III; the life-size sandstone seated Statue of Pharaoh Sety II wearing emblems marking his royal status; the monumental red granite Statue of a lion erected by Pharaoh Amenhotep III, reinscribed by Pharaoh Tutankhamun; the limestone Statue of future Pharaoh Horemheb and his wife; the huge painted limestone Relief showing King Mentuhotep II wearing the red crown; and the imposing monumental limestone sculpture of the Statue of Ramses II as a high-priest. \n\nAll of these are huge works with a dominating presence, a marked frontality and a sense of permanence. \nWhat intrigued me were some of the more intimate, immensely elaborate jewellery-like pieces that served as seals, rings, plaques, amulets, pendants, beads and earrings. \nThese include: the ornament of a winged Scarab holding a sun-disc, depicting the throne name of King Senusret II with its pieces of lapis lazuli; the faience Throwstick of Pharaoh Akhenaten \u2013 an ancient Egyptian boomerang; Girdle with amulets, beads and pendants made of electrum, silver, lapis lazuli, feldspar, amethyst, cornelian, glass; and the Ornament with a bull\u2019s head on a gold mount decorated with uraei and lotus flowers made of gold with the bull\u2019s head carved into a piece of lapis lazuli. \n\nWhile one may be seduced by the ornamental design, the exquisite craftsmanship and precious materials, there is also something ethereal about these objects of beauty. \nThey were intended to ward off evil spirits and beg for their owner\u2019s smooth transition into eternal life, where the person could experience life in their present form but free of pain, illness or hardship. \n3,000 years of art\nThe Book of the Dead (more accurately translated as the \u201cBook of Coming Forth by Day\u201d) was a collection of magic spells intended to assist a deceased person\u2019s journey through the underworld. The texts were prepared for a specific person and speak of the needs of a particular individual. \n\nSince I was a child, I loved reading this book as it was the voice of an ancient Egyptian speaking directly to me. \nOne passage reads: \n\nThere is no sin in my body. I have not spoken that which is not true knowingly, nor have I done anything with a false heart. Grant you that I may be like to those favoured ones who are in your following, and that I may be an Osiris greatly favoured of the beautiful god.\n\nThis beautiful and significant exhibition traces the art of ancient Egypt for 3,000 years from the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt and the beginnings of the Old Kingdom with the development of hieroglyphs, in about 3000 BCE, through to the Roman conquest. \nA solemn divine majesty runs throughout this exhibition as it celebrates the eternal and magical power of art. \nPharaoh is at the National Gallery of Victoria until October 6.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Ancient Egypt, National Gallery of Victoria, British Museum, Visual art review, Visual art and design","role":"assistant"}]}

This was accompanied by a predictable outpouring of I-told-you-sos on social media.\nExcess deaths are a measure of how many more deaths are being recorded in a country over what would have been expected based on historical trends. In the UK, and in many other countries, death rates have been higher during the years 2020 to 2023 than would have been expected based on historic trends from before the pandemic. But that has been known for some time. A couple of years ago I wrote an article for The Conversation pointing this out and suggesting some reasons. But has anything changed? \nThe authors of the new study, published in BMJ Public Health, used publicly available data from Our World in Data to determine which countries had \u201cstatistically significant\u201d excess deaths \u2013 in other words, excess deaths that couldn\u2019t be explained by mere random variation. \nThey studied the years 2020 to 2022 and found that many, but not all, countries did indeed report excess deaths. The authors did not try to explain why these excess deaths occurred, but the suggestion that COVID vaccines could have played a role is clear from their text \u2013 and indeed widely interpreted as such by certain newspapers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that a few deaths were associated with the COVID vaccines, but could the vaccination programme explain the large number of excess deaths \u2013 3 million in 47 countries \u2013 that have been reported? \nBased on death certificates, during 2020 and 2021 there were more deaths from COVID than estimated excess deaths in the UK. So during the year 2021 when most vaccine doses were administered, there were actually fewer non-COVID deaths than would have been expected. It was only in 2022 that excess deaths exceeded COVID deaths.   \nIf the vaccination campaign was contributing to the excess deaths that we have seen in recent years, then we should expect to see more deaths in people who have been vaccinated than in those who have not. The most reliable analysis in this regard was done by the UK\u2019s Office for National Statistics (ONS). In this analysis, the ONS matched death registrations with the vaccine histories of each death recorded. They then calculated \u201cage-standardised death rates\u201d to account for age differences between those vaccinated and those not.\nWhat the ONS found was that in all months from April 2021 to May 2023, the death rate from all causes was higher in the unvaccinated than in people who had been vaccinated at least once.  \nThat deaths from all causes were lower in the vaccinated than the unvaccinated should come as no surprise given that COVID was a major cause of death in 2021 and 2022. And there is ample evidence of the protective effect of vaccines against severe COVID and death. But what is even more convincing is that, even when known COVID deaths were excluded in the ONS report, the death rate in the unvaccinated was still higher, albeit not by very much in more recent months.\nSome COVID deaths would certainly not have been recognised as such. But, on the other hand, people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes, were a high priority for vaccination. And these people would have been at increased risk of death even before the pandemic.  \n\nPossible causes\nIf the vaccine is not the cause of the excess deaths, what was? \nThe major cause of the excess deaths reported in the first two years of the BMJ Public Health study was deaths from COVID. But by 2022, excess deaths exceeded COVID deaths in many countries. \nPossible explanations for these excess deaths include longer-term effects of earlier COVID infections, the return of infections such as influenza that had been suppressed during the COVID control measures, adverse effects of lockdowns on physical and mental health, and delays in the diagnosis of life-threatening infections as health services struggled to cope with the pandemic and its aftermath. \nWe do need to look very carefully at how the pandemic was managed. There is still considerable debate about the effectiveness of different behavioural control measures, such as self-isolation and lockdowns. Even when such interventions were effective at reducing transmission of COVID, what were the harms and were the gains worth the harms? Nevertheless, we can be confident that the excess deaths seen in recent years were not a consequence of the vaccination campaign.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Excess deaths, Covid vaccination, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nHumans have long been fascinated by organisms that can produce light. Aristotle, who was a scientist as well as a philosopher, wrote the first detailed descriptions of what he called \u201ccold light\u201d more than 2,000 years ago. More recently, pioneering researchers like World War II Army veteran Emmett Chappelle and deep submergence vehicle pilot Edith Widder advanced the study of this phenomenon with novel technologies.  \nAt least 94 living organisms produce their own light through a chemical reaction inside their bodies \u2013 an ability called bioluminescence. Examples include luminous fireflies, algae that create \u201cglow-in-the-dark\u201d bays, small crustaceans with intricate courtship displays, and deep-sea fish and coral. Yet despite its widespread occurrence, scientists don\u2019t yet know when or where it first emerged, or its original function. \nAs marine biologists who specialize in deep-sea habitats, we know that bioluminescence is particularly common in the ocean. This indicates that light production may give organisms from across the tree of life a fitness advantage that improves their chances of survival. \nOur research focuses on octocorals \u2013 soft-bodied corals such as sea fans that have treelike shapes and are found in various places in the world\u2019s oceans. They are a diverse and ancient group of animals that includes some 3,500 species, many of which are bioluminescent. \n\nOctocorals can create coral gardens and animal forests in the oceans, particularly in the deep sea. These communities provide homes and nursery habitats for many other animals, including fish and sharks. \nAll octocorals use the same chemical reaction to bioluminesce. A 2022 study determined the evolutionary relationships among these corals. These genetic connections, and the fact that fossils of octocorals exist, make these animals an ideal focus to investigate when bioluminescence appeared and how it spread across geological time. \nTesting for bioluminescence at sea\nOver a decade ago, we started testing the ability of different octocoral species to bioluminesce. To produce the glowing light, corals must be stimulated either physically or chemically. \nBioluminescence first piqued our curiosity during a 2014 research cruise on the R\/V Celtic Explorer over the Whittard Canyon off the southwest coast of Ireland. We were taking a tissue sample of a bamboo coral collected from the deep seafloor by a remotely operated vehicle. \nThe vehicle had manipulator arms that allowed the pilot to collect coral specimens and place them in sampling containers to keep the organisms alive and protected as the vehicle surfaced. After this sample came onboard the ship, we used forceps to take a single coral polyp from it in a room with low lighting and saw a flash of blue light. \nSince then, we have worked with collaborators from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and Tohoku University to record what species are able to glow, either on the ship after collection or as we observe them on the seafloor using low-light cameras. Combined with previous published records, we now know that bioluminescence occurs in approximately 60 coral species. It\u2019s likely that many more await discovery. \n\nWhen and why bioluminescence emerged\nIn a study published in April 2024, we presented the oldest record in geological time for bioluminescence on Earth. We showed that this chemical reaction evolved several millennia earlier than the previous estimate, around the time that life on Earth rapidly diversified over 540 million years ago in a period called the Cambrian Explosion. We determined this by mapping the presence of bioluminescence onto the octocoral tree of life, a graphic tool that biologists use to show evolutionary relationships among species.\nInitially, bioluminescence may have evolved to reduce free radicals \u2013 chemically unstable atoms that can damage cells. However, at some point, it evolved into a form of communication. \nOur results indicate that light signaling was the earliest form of communication in the oceans, and we know that some animals that could detect light evolved during the Cambrian period. Our research indicates that interactions involving light occurred among species during a time when animals were rapidly diversifying and occupying new habitats. \n\nGaining and losing light\nWe are continuing to test corals for bioluminescent abilities in a variety of ways. One main component involved in producing light in corals and other animals is an enzyme called luciferase. Using DNA sequence data, we are developing a test for the genetic potential to bioluminesce  that will make it easier and less invasive for us to study this trait.  \nWe have preliminary evidence that non-bioluminescent octocorals still have homologous luciferase genes \u2013 genetic instructions that were passed down from a common ancestor of all octocorals. Why corals that can\u2019t produce light have retained these genes is a mystery. \nDo they produce very low-level light that scientists can\u2019t detect with current methods? Or are their luciferase genes nonfunctional? Further study may show why certain octocorals appear to have lost the ability to bioluminesce, and how this loss may have affected their survival in different habitats. \nOur recent results show that many corals that live in shallow waters but arose from deep-water ancestors retained the ability to bioluminesce. It is possible that some corals lost this ability over time as it became less useful in shallower ocean settings with more light. \n\nWe also are investigating how bioluminescence has evolved in other creatures, including shrimp that migrate upward from deep waters to feed in the daytime and return to deep waters at night. These animals are exposed to changing light conditions and produce light in multiple, unique ways.\nAs one notable example, some shrimp vomit light-making chemicals, creating a luminescent spew to fend off predators. They also have external bioluminescent light organs along their body that produce blue light. \nStudying creatures like these improves our understanding of how different amounts of light in the environment, including light produced by organisms, affect the evolution of bioluminescence and influence organisms\u2019 vision. This can provide insight into how bioluminescence affected eye evolution and vision some 540 million years ago, when life on Earth was diversifying. \nThe fact that corals have been able to produce light for hundreds of millions of years implies that this ability has contributed significantly to their survival. Furthermore, our findings support the idea that bioluminescence has been a critical form of communication through geologic time for many types of animals, particularly in the deep sea. \nThis research has sparked new ideas for us about early animal evolution and communication. Light signaling gave animals a new way to communicate in a rapidly changing time, when new predators and a more complex landscape were emerging. Increased sensory capabilities in the ocean could have been valuable in these conditions. Perhaps bioluminescence is a missing piece of the puzzle that has not yet received full attention in studies of the origin and evolution of animals in deep time.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Evolution, Biology, Communication, Corals, Marine biology, Cambrian explosion, Shrimp, Fireflies, Bioluminescence","role":"assistant"}]}

As insurance companies wade through a further 30% average increase in compensation claims, have the tarmac cracks in our hole-riddled roads become a symbol for all that is wrong with our infrastructure?\nAlthough the finger is pointed repeatedly at local councils for deteriorating roads, their condition is not solely a result of neglect. Heavy rain and wildly fluctuating temperatures place untold strain on any pre-existing cracks and crevices.  \nFinally the matter has come to a head as political parties learn that, for some, it\u2019s not taxes, but potholes that need addressing. Rishi Sunak for example, has realised late in the day, that it is not more low emissions zones that are needed, but pothole repair. Will the \u00a38.3 billion the Conservative manifesto has pledged for this purpose woo the hearts, wheels and votes of the road-loving population? \nEither way, it is not a problem that is going to go away. Along with climate, the nature of road usage has fundamentally changed. Online orders and home deliveries are now the preferred shopping choice of many, and the volume and weight of freight-laden vehicles accelerates the wear and tear. As our roads become a patchwork of filled-in holes, it might be worth remembering how we got the roads we now have.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor many of us, cobblestones are synonymous with history. Still a frequent sight in the older quarters of towns and cities, their durability demonstrates exactly how revolutionary Thomas Telford\u2019s road-laying techniques were.  \nNicknamed \u201cThe Colossus of Roads\u201d, Telford\u2019s specifications were labour-intensive and expensive, but cobblestones were one of the few surfaces able to withstand the relentless pounding of horses\u2019 hooves and iron wheels of Victorian traffic. So why were so many later overlaid or replaced entirely? The answer is largely noise.  \nBy the 1840s newspapers such as The Times were routinely inundated with rants and proposed remedies to the ever-increasing clatter of the streets. The writer Charles Dickens went as far as to claim that his close friend and illustrator John Leech was driven to his early death in 1864 by the daily bombardment outside his study. \nAdmittedly this was not traffic noise alone, but the incessant cacophony of street buskers, hawkers, dogs, cracked whips, bells and the regular herding of livestock to market. As so many cowered from the din, W.H. Delano, general manager of the Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Asphaltes de France (General Asphalt Company of France), referred to a new condition to explain Leech\u2019s magnified anxiety \u2013 \u201cagoraphobia\u201d.\nDespite this, the Victorians were masters of compromise and adaptation. And when it came to urban life, 19th-century city dwellers were adept at balancing the impracticalities of their lifestyles with the condition of their streets. \nWealthier ladies carried their evening shoes in bags, pinned up their trains, tacked detachable \u201cdust strips\u201d or ruffles to their dress fronts like mud guards and even wore precarious wood or iron pattens \u2013 effectively strap on stilts \u2013 to elevate their skirts above the dirt. As the writer Jane Austen implies in her regency novels: a clean hem, however it was achieved, was a sign of class. \n\nFashion and noise aside, there were any number of reasons why cobbling all of London\u2019s streets was too great a feat. The expense of the requisite 600,000 tonnes of granite, plus the skill demanded for its shaping and laying was an art form too slow for a city that increased in population daily. Also, they were slippery in the perpetual slurry, trip hazards in the smog, while horses caught their hooves on any unrounded edges. In short, it was time for 19th-century authorities to think outside the box.\nThe most effective solution may sound like an unlikely one: wooden roads. In 1839, pine blocks were trialled in that most frequented of London thoroughfares outside the Old Bailey court. These appeared to tick all the boxes, being quieter, smoother, gentler on horse hooves and less perilous in muddy conditions. But, as with macadam (an 1820\u2019s recipe that bound compacted stones with asphalt), they wore out quickly.\nMore unexpected problems soon arose. In Piccadilly, the experiment with pine was abandoned after a matter of weeks as horse urine (averaging a gallon a day for each of London\u2019s 300,000 horses) soaked the porous wood and in the baking heat emitted potent ammonia fumes. \nLocal shopkeepers complained of lost trade and discoloured shop frontages \u2013 would you buy your bread from a yellowing bakery that smelt of wee? \u2013 and health concerns. W.H. Delano, an ardent proponent of the asphalt used in Paris, declared the \u201cunhygienic\u201d paving was \u201cstunting growth of children and debilitating adults\u201d with its unhealthy vapours. He added that, after one or two years, they came to resemble \u201cworn-out tooth brushes\u201d and even became a fire risk.\nUrban planners weren\u2019t about to give up that easily though.  \nThe years to come saw experiments with different types and cuts of wood, with creosote treatments, concrete-fillers, cork and rubber coatings. While the latter of these was a slip-prone failure, it sparked a new idea entirely \u2013 why rubber coat the road, when you could just as easily coat a vehicle\u2019s wheels? Enter the tyre.\nMeanwhile, in the forests of Australia, Richard Watkins Richards, the mayor of Sydney in the 1890s, had come upon the optimum material. Nine times denser than its English alternatives, the tropical hardwood \u201cJarrah\u201d (eucalyptus marginata) was durable and urine-resistant but, being on the other side of the world, also expensive and labour intensive. \n\nInevitably, the roads of the wealthy were the priority for such woods, while others simply had to endure what, in 1894, Major Lewis Isaac declared a \u201cmost sickening odour\u201d. Even so, Bartholomew\u2019s map of London shows that by 1928, London had over 53 miles of wooden roads.\nThe last unassuming remnants can be found in some of London\u2019s streets but by the 1950s, \u201crepavement\u201d had progressively replaced the tired wood with the wonder substance of tarmac or asphalt.

But one mystery still remains.\nThe Homo sapiens genome today contains a little bit of Neanderthal DNA. These genetic traces come from almost every part of the Neanderthal genome \u2013 except the Y sex chromosome, which is responsible for making males.\nSo what happened to the Neanderthal Y chromosome? It could have been lost by accident, or because of  mating patterns or inferior function. However, the answer may lie in a century-old theory about the health of interspecies hybrids.\n\n\n\n\n\nNeanderthal sex, genes and chromosomes\nNeanderthals and modern humans went their separate ways somewhere between 550,000 and 765,000 years ago in Africa, when Neanderthals wandered off into Europe but our ancestors stayed put. They would not meet again until H. sapiens migrated into Europe and Asia between 40,000 and 50,000 years ago.\nScientists have recovered copies of the full male and female Neanderthal genomes, thanks to DNA from well-preserved bones and teeth of Neanderthal individuals in Europe and Asia. Unsurprisingly, the Neanderthal genome was very similar to ours, containing about 20,000 genes bundled into 23 chromosomes. \nLike us, they had two copies of 22 of those chromosomes (one from each parent), and also a pair of sex chromosomes. Females had two X chromosomes, while males had one X and one Y.\nY chromosomes are hard to sequence because they contain a lot of repetitive \u201cjunk\u201d DNA, so the Neanderthal Y genome has only been partially sequenced. However, the large chunk that has been sequenced contains versions of several of the same genes that are in the modern human Y chromosome.\nIn modern humans, a Y chromosome gene called SRY kickstarts the process of an XY embryo developing into a male. The SRY gene plays this role in all apes, so we assume it did for Neanderthals as well \u2013 even though we haven\u2019t found the Neanderthal SRY gene itself. \nInterspecies mating left us with Neanderthal genes\nThere are lots of little giveaways that mark a DNA sequence as coming from a Neanderthal or a H. sapiens. So we can look for bits of Neanderthal DNA sequence in the genomes of modern humans. \nThe genomes of all human lineages originating in Europe contain about 2% Neanderthal DNA sequences. Lineages from Asia and India contain even more, while lineages restricted to Africa have none. Some ancient Homo sapiens genomes contained even more \u2013 6% or so \u2013 so it looks like the Neanderthal genes are gradually fading out.\nMost of this Neanderthal DNA arrived in a 7,000-year period about 47,000 years ago, after modern humans came out of Africa into Europe, and before Neanderthals became extinct about 30,000 years ago. During this time there must have been many pairings between Neanderthals and humans.\nAt least half of the whole Neanderthal genome can be pieced together from fragments found in the genomes of different contemporary humans. We have our Neanderthal ancestors to thank for traits including red hair, arthritis and resistance to some diseases. \nThere is one glaring exception. No contemporary humans have been found to harbour any part of the Neanderthal Y chromosome.\nWhat happened to the Neanderthal Y chromosome?\nWas it just bad luck that the Neanderthal Y chromosome got lost? Was it not very good at its job of making males? Did Neanderthal women, but not men, indulge in interspecies mating? Or was there something toxic about the Neanderthal Y so it wouldn\u2019t work with human genes? \nA Y chromosome comes to the end of the line if its bearers have no sons, so it may simply have been lost over thousands of generations. \nOr maybe the Neanderthal Y was never present in interspecies matings. Perhaps it was always modern human men who fell in love with (or traded, seized or raped) Neanderthal women? Sons born to these women would all have the H. sapiens form of the Y chromosome. However, it\u2019s hard to reconcile this idea with the finding that there is no trace of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA (which is limited to the female line) in modern humans.\nOr perhaps the Neanderthal Y chromosome was just not as good at is job as its H. sapiens rival. Neanderthal populations were always small, so harmful mutations would have been more likely to accumulate. \nWe know that Y chromosomes with a particularly useful gene (for instance for more or better or faster sperm) rapidly replace other Y chromosomes in a population (called the hitchhiker effect).\nWe also know the Y chromosome is degrading overall in humans. It is even possible that SRY was lost from the Neanderthal Y, and that Neanderthals were in the disruptive process of evolving a new sex-determining gene, like some rodents have.\nWas the Neanderthal Y chromosome toxic in hybrid boys?\nAnother possibility is that the Neanderthal Y chromosome won\u2019t work with genes on other chromosomes from modern humans. \nThe missing Neanderthal Y may then be explained by \u201cHaldane\u2019s rule\u201d. In the 1920s, British biologist J.B.S. Haldane noted that, in hybrids between species, if one sex is infertile, rare or unhealthy, it is always the sex with unlike sex chromosomes.\nIn mammals and other animals where females have XX chromosomes and males have XY, it is disproportionately male hybrids that are unfit or infertile. In birds, butterflies and other animals where males have ZZ chromosomes and females have ZW, it is the females.\nMany crosses between different species of mice show this pattern, as do feline crosses. For example, in lion\u2013tiger crosses (ligers and tigons), females are fertile but males are sterile.\nWe still lack a good explanation of Haldane\u2019s rule. It is one of the enduring mysteries of classic genetics. \nBut it seems reasonable that the Y chromosome from one species has evolved to work with genes from the other chromosomes of its own species, and might not work with genes from a related species that contain even small changes. \nWe know that genes on the Y evolve much faster than genes on other chromosomes,  and several have functions in making sperm, which may explain the infertility of male hybrids.\nSo this might explain why the Neanderthal Y got lost. It also raises the possibility that it was the fault of the Y chromosome, in imposing a reproductive barrier, that Neanderthals and humans became separate species in the first place.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Genetics, Human evolution, Homo sapiens, Neanderthals, Y chromosome, Sex chromosomes, Human evolutionary biology","role":"assistant"}]}

Developed during the UK\u2019s protracted withdrawal from the European Union, the idea of repositioning the country as a world leader (for example in trade, security, vaccines and just about everything) was always too closely associated with the boosterism of former prime minister Boris Johnson and the record-breakingly brief premiership of Liz Truss to survive a switch to a more \u201csensible\u201d form of government under Rishi Sunak.\nHowever, the fundamentals of the Australia\u2013UK relationship remain solid. There was a time when British and Australian ministers would meet, say how well the two countries got on, make jokes about cricket and then struggle to find anything meaningful to discuss. But times have changed.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UK Conservative government actively courted a revived relationship with Australia even before Brexit. The UK\u2019s withdrawal from the EU provided an opportunity for Australia to sign another free trade agreement \u2013 widely but quietly assumed to work in Australia\u2019s favour \u2013 and do so while asserting what great mates the two countries are. AUKUS then put the relationship on a renewed strategic footing.\nLabour\u2019s path to victory\nThis brings us to the electoral geography of Labour\u2019s chances of gaining the keys to 10 Downing Street. The submarine-building program of AUKUS is good for jobs in the north of England. Winning back working-class votes in the so-called \u201cRed Wall\u201d of northern English constituencies, after Labour\u2019s disastrous showing in 2019, is central to Labour\u2019s hopes of victory. \nUnder Sir Keir Starmer, party leader since 2020, Labour has worked hard \u2013 too hard, some might say \u2013 to win back socially conservative voters who abandoned the party due to its equivocation on Brexit under the unpopular Jeremy Corbyn. \nIn contrast to the left-wing Corbyn, Starmer has embraced the Union Jack, broken his silence on Brexit to quash hopes of the UK ever rejoining the EU, and rolled back pledges for green initiatives. \n\nThis will no doubt cost Labour some support from progressive voters. Starmer\u2019s handling of the party\u2019s response to the conflict in Gaza has already lost some support among Muslim voters who typically vote Labour. Nevertheless, the electoral calculation is that progressives cannot bring themselves to vote for the Conservatives, so their vote can be banked. \nBut people can choose not to vote at all in the UK, and many may decide to stay away on election day. This could depress the vote for both major parties.\nThe rise of minor parties\nThis leaves the door open for minor parties to have an outsized effect on July 4. \nThe Conservatives may lose votes to their right and left. Socially conservative right-wing voters, energised by the anti-woke tactics of the evermore right-leaning Tories, can vote for Reform UK. \nThis party is the successor to the radical populist UK Independence Party and the Brexit Party, both formerly led by Nigel Farage. At the previous election, Farage did the Tories a huge favour and declined to run candidates against Brexit-supporting Conservatives. With Brexit done, Farage\u2019s successor at the head of Reform, Richard Tice, is unlikely to be so generous. \n\nOn their left, the Conservatives may also lose support from moderate voters (those put off by their anti-woke tactics) in the so-called \u201cBlue Wall\u201d of usually Conservative-voting constituencies in the south of England. These people, if they vote at all, may vote for the centrist Liberal Democrats.\nAnd in Scotland, the pro-independence Scottish National Party is having struggles of its own. It\u2019s been in government since 2007 and is plagued by leadership problems. Its loss may well be Labour\u2019s gain as it seeks to win back votes it lost to the SNP after the independence referendum in 2014.\nNew soundtrack for an old friendship\nSo, if Labour does get back into Downing Street there will be a change of mood music in the Australia\u2013UK relationship. \nWhen the Conservatives were in power in London and the Coalition was in power in Canberra, the two governments saw eye-to-eye ideologically. There was talk in the media of the Anglosphere shaping international relations and even saving the West (from itself).\nAssuming the current shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, stays in his post if Labour forms the next government, the UK will be much more focused on repairing relations with the EU in general and France in particular (see AUKUS) than directly focused on the Indo-Pacific. It may be the UK\u2019s capabilities in this region have been overstated by the Conservative government.\n\nLabour is far less enamoured with the supposed benefits of unfettered free trade than the \u201cGlobal Britain\u201d wing of the Conservative Party. Nonetheless, the UK\u2013Australian free trade agreement is in place and here to stay.\nAll in all, it would take a lot to push Australia and the UK apart, although it\u2019s happened in the past. The major threat to AUKUS will not be from a change of government in London, but from a different president in Washington. \nIf Labour wins government on July 4, some of the inflated hopes for the Australia\u2013UK relationship will recede. But the two countries will still be great mates, and the jokes about cricket will be back for another innings, just with a different captain.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"UK politics, Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, AUKUS, 2024 UK election, World news","role":"assistant"}]}

Advocates claim raw milk has superior health benefits over pasteurized milk. There is little evidence to support these claims, however, and the risk of serious illness is much greater.\nMississippi State University food scientists Juan Silva and Joel Komakech and nutritionist Mandy Conrad explain the difference between pasteurized and raw milk, addressing common misconceptions about the health risks and purported benefits of consuming unpasteurized milk. These questions are more important than ever, since cattle can shed viral material into their milk. Not only can pathogens end up in milk, but at least three farmworkers reportedly have contracted H5N1, the virus that causes avian influenza, in 2024. Farmworkers can get sick by handling infected animals or their byproducts, such as raw milk.\nWhat is pasteurization? Does it destroy nutrients?\nPasteurization is a process that involves heating beverages and foods at high temperatures \u2013 over 145 degrees Fahrenheit (62.78 degrees Celsius) \u2013 to kill harmful microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites. This reduces the total number of microorganisms in the product and also inactivates enzymes that could contribute to spoilage. \nThe taste, nutritional value and quality of pasteurized products aren\u2019t significantly affected by the process. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile pasteurization can lead to some nutrient losses, the changes are generally minimal and outweighed by the benefits. Pasteurization typically causes minor denaturation of proteins and has little effect on fats and carbohydrates. While water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and some B vitamins, usually not abundant in milk except vitamin B2, can be partially degraded during pasteurization, fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K, found in significant amounts in milk) are more heat stable and suffer minimal loss. \nThus, nutritional losses in milk due to pasteurization are generally small compared with the significant benefits of reducing foodborne illnesses and spoilage.\nIs raw milk healthier than pasteurized milk?\nStudies have compared the benefits of raw milk with pasteurized milk and have found little evidence that raw milk is superior to pasteurized milk. The perceived advantages of raw milk are outweighed by its health risks. \nFirst, raw milk does not improve lactose intolerance. \nRaw milk also does not have more vitamins than pasteurized milk. Milk is not a good source of vitamin C or other heat-sensitive vitamins, and pasteurization does little to reduce vitamin B2 or riboflavin, which is not as sensitive to heat. Moreover, Vitamin D is added to pasteurized milk to enhance your body\u2019s ability to absorb the calcium in milk. \n\nFortified milk replaces nutrients that may be lost in the pasteurization process. Vitamin D is added to milk to enhance uptake of the calcium found in the milk. No single food is perfect, so it is OK for milk to lack some nutrients, as these can be obtained from other foods.\nSome people believe that probiotics \u2013 foods or supplements that contain live bacteria beneficial to health \u2013 are more prevalent in unpasteurized milk and products made from raw milk. However, raw milk is generally lacking in probiotics and has significantly more harmful bacteria. Probiotics are added to many dairy foods such as yogurt after pasteurization.  \nFurthermore, a 2011 review of the available research on the health benefits of raw milk found that many of these studies were conducted with poor methods, meaning their results should be interpreted with caution.\nWhat are the health risks of consuming raw milk?\nThe health risks of consuming raw, unpasteurized milk come from the harmful microorganisms that may be present. \nRaw milk has been associated with hundreds of foodborne disease outbreaks. Between 1998 and 2018, 202 outbreaks resulted in 2,645 illnesses and 228 hospitalizations. More recently, from 2022 to 2023, there were 18 outbreaks and recalls associated with raw milk. A number of outbreaks and recalls associated with pathogens in raw milk have already occurred in 2024. In all cases, pathogens in the raw milk that cause human diseases were directly responsible for these illnesses. \n\nSome illnesses from the pathogens in raw milk can have serious long-term effects, including paralysis, kidney failure and death.\nResearchers found that areas where raw milk was legally sold in the U.S. from 1998 to 2018 had over three times more outbreaks than areas where selling raw milk was illegal. Areas where raw milk was allowed to be sold in retail stores had nearly four times more outbreaks than areas where sales were allowed only on farms. \nIs it safe to eat foods made from raw milk?\nMany, if not all, dairy products made from unpasteurized milk are not safe to eat. A number of products can be made from raw milk, including soft cheeses, such as brie and Camembert; Mexican-style soft cheeses, such as queso fresco, panela, asadero and queso blanco; yogurt and puddings; and ice cream or frozen yogurt. Pathogens in raw milk can survive the processes involved in making these types of dairy products and thus be unsafe for consumption.\nOnly products that undergo a process to inhibit or kill harmful microorganisms may be safe enough to be made from unpasteurized milk. However, the potential for cross contamination of raw and cooked food as well as the survival of pathogens from inadequate processing is high when products are made with raw milk.\nCan pasteurized milk still get you sick?\nThe few reported outbreaks associated with pasteurized milk can be traced to contamination after pasteurization. When handled properly, pasteurized milk is a very safe product.\nThe U.S. government requires farmers to destroy milk from herds infected with avian influenza. As of June 2024, 12 states have reported herds positive with H1N5, the virus that causes bird flu. \nThere is currently no evidence that consuming pasteurized milk from infected cows causes illness in people. Based on the evidence available, the Food and Drug Administration currently states that pasteurization is able to destroy or inactivate heat-sensitive viruses such as H5N1 in milk. \nConsuming raw milk, however, may pose a risk of disease transmission to people.\nCan you gain immunity from H5N1 from drinking raw milk?\nSome people believe that drinking raw milk can strengthen their immune system. However, there is no scientific evidence to support that drinking raw milk can improve immunity against disease.\nVaccines train your body to protect itself from future infections without actually getting sick from that infection. They do this by exposing your immune system to very small amounts of dead or significantly weakened pathogen.\n\nRaw milk contains live H5N1 virus, meaning it could still infect you and make you sick. Rather than contributing to your immunity, raw milk exposes you to the virus at its full strength and can result in severe illness. Any protective antibodies that may be present in raw milk are likely degraded in stomach acid. \nMoreover, people who contract bird flu from raw milk run the risk of transmitting it to other people or animals by giving the virus a chance to adapt and improve its ability to spread between people. This increases the risk of more widespread disease outbreaks.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Nutrition, Avian flu H5N1, Dairy, Food-borne illness, Food processing, Bird flu, Raw milk, Health misinformation, Q+A, Pasteurization","role":"assistant"}]}

The results of these animal studies are often reported in the media, perhaps raising hope these \u201cmiracle\u201d, \u201cpromising\u201d or \u201cdramatic\u201d findings will one day be replicated in humans and lead to a new drug.\nBut in a study published today, we find out how few of these therapies tested in animals receive regulatory approval for use in humans and end up on the market. \nThe Swiss and UK researchers found just 5% made the grade and for those that were successful, the process took an average ten years.\nHere\u2019s why so few drug candidates in animal trials end up as human therapies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnimal studies have their place, but are flawed\nAnimal studies can be valuable for learning about diseases and finding possible drug targets. But they can\u2019t fully tell us how safe and effective treatments will be for humans.\nFor example, some potential treatments for Alzheimer\u2019s, stroke and cancer worked well in animals but didn\u2019t work the same in people.\nSo the authors looked at what percentage of therapies successfully moved from animal studies to human use, the time this took, and whether the results from animal and human studies agreed.\nThey did this by combining and analysing the results of studies published before August 2023 using a variety of techniques.\nThey assessed the quality of the included studies using a meta-analysis (which combines the results of several studies) to work out whether positive outcomes in animal studies translated into positive outcomes from human studies.\nIn total, 122 papers were included in a brief overview known as a \u201cnarrative summary\u201d, with 62 of these included in the meta-analysis.\nThe researchers then used a statistical technique called \u201csurvival analysis\u201d to estimate the time it took for therapies to progress from animal studies to clinical trials and regulatory approval.\nWhat they found\nOverall, the researchers found that of 367 therapeutic interventions tested in 54 human diseases:\n\n50% progressed from animal studies to human clinical trials\n40% progressed to randomised controlled trials (large, clinical phase 3 trials, the ones generally needed before regulatory approval)\n5% received regulatory approval. \n\nTheir meta-analysis showed 86% of positive results in animal studies were translated into positive results in subsequent human trials.\nFor animal studies that progressed, the researchers found it took an average:\n\nfive years for animal studies to reach any human study\nseven years to reach a randomised controlled trial\nten years for regulatory approval.\n\nWhy the gap?\nThe authors found many of the animal studies were not well designed, making their results less valid. \nFor example, most did not include blinding, where the investigator does not know which animal received each treatment, or randomisation of animals to treatments. \nMany animal studies also involved too few animals to provide reliable evidence of whether the treatment was successful. \nAnimal studies often involve young, healthy animals, while human patients may have multiple health conditions and be older. Animal studies often focus on how a drug works on a molecular level, while human studies prioritise the drug\u2019s overall effectiveness. \nFinally, the outcomes measured in animal studies might not always reflect the most important clinical outcomes for patients.\n\nThe authors suggested researchers need to focus on the quality and relevance of animal studies if we are to improve drug development.\nResearchers need to ensure studies are well-designed, use appropriate animal models, and measure outcomes that matter to patients.\nThe authors also recommended closer collaboration between animal and human researchers to help bridge the gap between preclinical and clinical research.\nHow worried should we be?\nThe use of animals in research raises many ethical questions about the suffering and harm inflicted on them for potentially limited human benefit. \nThe high failure rate of animal studies in translating to human therapies amplifies these concerns, as it questions the justification for using animals in research. \nThe discrepancy between animal and human results highlights the limitations of animal models in accurately predicting human responses to drugs. This raises questions about the scientific validity of relying solely on animal data for drug development decisions.\nHowever, on the bright side, the high failure rate and cost of animal studies has spurred the development of alternative research methods that do not rely on animals. \nThese include in vitro (laboratory) studies, human-relevant cell and tissue models, organ-on-a-chip systems, and computational in silico modelling which involves simulation on computers.\nClearly, it would be wonderful if we did not need to use animals in drug development. But with the increasing use of alternative methods such as computer modelling, and the advent of artificial intelligence to design new drugs and minimise animal testing, this might be in sight.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Clinical trials, Animal research, Health, Hype, Animal studies, New research, New research, Australia New Zealand","role":"assistant"}]}

The question in climate policy is no longer how much adopting net zero technologies will \u201ccost\u201d us. It is how quickly the savings from their adoption can be realised to benefit households, the economy and above all the climate.\nFor instance, the manifesto proposes continuing to invest in \u201cnew fossil fuel extraction through annual licensing rounds\u201d and building \u201cnew gas power stations\u201d. But these are unlikely to save money or to make the nation more energy secure, even in the near-term. By 2030, offshore wind power is expected to be 66% cheaper than gas-fired power.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar costs savings are possible elsewhere. Our analysis  of the investments needed to achieve the UK\u2019s climate targets, shows that in more than 80% of investments, the total lifetime cost of a clean technology is considerably lower than that of a fossil technology, after accounting for cheaper running costs. Electric cars, for example, will by 2030 be 60% cheaper to buy and run than a fossil fuel car.\n\nThe manifesto suggests that it will ensure household bills are lower by reigning in \u201cgreen levies\u201d. These have actually remained broadly stable over time and relatively low as a proportion of household total energy bills, whereas wholesale energy costs have spiked from 40% to 75% of total bills in recent years, driven by volatility in gas prices. Notably, green levies are not just used to finance renewable energy and reduce emissions, but also to support vulnerable households through the winter months.\nOur analysis shows that lower bills can be achieved by increasing investments in clean technologies such as electric vehicles sooner rather than later. That means people can benefit from the lower running costs of these technologies over their lifetimes, which we estimate can be up to \u00a3380 per year for a household with a car. Reducing or slowing down investment in green technologies will make these benefits harder to attain.\nProcrastination: no solution to net zero challenge\nThe manifesto says little about how the decarbonisation of the household sector will be achieved in the next parliament. This sector has been neglected since 2013, when David Cameron \u201ccut the green crap\u201d, eventually exposing households to a \u00a32.5 billion increase in energy bills in 2022, requiring expensive policy interventions.\nIn 2023, annual heat pump deployment was around 80% below where it should have been if following the \u201cbalanced net zero\u201d trajectory set out by the government\u2019s official advisory Climate Change Committee. Similarly, EV car sales were 50% below where they should have been. Our analysis  shows that the household sector will require around two-thirds of the total investment needed in clean technologies to 2030.\nThe manifesto states it will ensure that \u201c\u2026families are given time to make changes that affect their lives and never forcing people to rip out their existing boiler and replace it with a heat pump\u201d.\nThe Climate Change Committee\u2019s Sixth Carbon budget states that by the early 2030s, all new cars and vans and all boiler replacements in homes and other buildings be low-carbon \u2013 largely electric. This requires policy support.\nMany households that are fuel-poor tend to have less cash in the bank and less access to credit, or may be renters and powerless to make those changes in any case. Households also face non-monetary barriers such as time, access to information, and misperceptions around the \u201ccost\u201d of net zero. This means that some will undervalue the savings that heat pumps or better insulation will provide in future and so will see it as a poor investment.\nTherefore, solutions that involve simply waiting, or handing households money through tax cuts, are unlikely to influence their decision to invest in these technologies \u2013 not just delaying the transition, but denying people the savings and co-benefits.\nReinventing the Climate Change Act\nThe manifesto makes a number of suggestions to improve the way climate policy is decided. Pretty much all of them are already contained in the 2008 Climate Change Act. \nThe Conservatives would like to \u201creform the Climate Change Committee, giving it an explicit mandate to consider cost to households and UK energy security in its future climate advice.\u201d Section 10 of the Act does exactly that.\nSimilarly, the manifesto proposes \u201cguaranteeing a vote in the next parliament on the next stage of our pathway.\u201d This is how the UK\u2019s carbon budgets are already set. Section 8 requires that carbon budgets, which define the next stage of emissions reduction, are approved by parliament.\nFinally, the manifesto wants to ensure that in future \u201c[the] adoption of any new target [is] accompanied by proper consideration of the plans and policies required to meet the target, to maintain democratic consent for the big decisions that net zero will mean for our country.\u201d Section 14 already requires the secretary of state to report this to parliament.\nMissed opportunity for investment and jobs\nInitial analyses  have estimated the tax cuts and spending pledges in the manifesto at around \u00a318 billion, mostly attributed to tax cuts. The spending associated with climate-related policy appears to be orders of magnitude lower than what is needed for the transition. \nFor instance, the \u00a31.1 billion \u201cGreen Industries Growth Accelerator\u201d amounts to \u00a3220 million a year over the next parliament. The manifesto proposes to \u201cinvest \u00a36 billion in energy efficiency over the next three years to make around a million homes warmer\u201d and to \u201cfund an energy efficiency voucher scheme open to every household in England, to support the installation of energy efficiency measures and solar panels, helping families lower their bills.\u201d\nBut our study  shows that, to align with net zero, \u00a36 billion to \u00a38 billion of public finance will be needed per year, primarily in the buildings sector. \nClimate change does need investment, but it is investment with a substantial return.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Conservative Party, Give me perspective, UK election 2024, UK climate policy","role":"assistant"}]}

Scientists estimate that more than 90% of the excess heat produced by human activities has been taken up by the ocean. \nThat warming, hidden for years in data of interest only to oceanographers, is now having profound consequences for coastal economies around the world.\n\nUnderstanding the role of the ocean in the economy is something I have been working on for more than 40 years, currently at the Center for the Blue Economy of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. Mostly, I study the positive contributions of the ocean, but this has begun to change, sometimes dramatically. Climate change has made the ocean a threat to the economy in multiple ways.\nThe dangers of sea-level rise\nOne of the big threats to economies from ocean warming is sea-level rise. As water warms, it expands. Along with meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets, thermal expansion of the water has increased flooding in low-lying coastal areas and put the future of island nations at risk.\nIn the U.S., rising sea levels will soon overwhelm Isle de Jean Charles in Louisiana and Tangier Island in Chesapeake Bay. \nFlooding at high tide, even on sunny days, is becoming increasingly common in places such as Miami Beach; Annapolis, Maryland; Norfolk, Virginia; and San Francisco. High-tide flooding has more than doubled since 2000 and is on track to triple by 2050 along the country\u2019s coasts.\n\nRising sea levels also push salt water into freshwater aquifers, from which water is drawn to support agriculture. The strawberry crop in coastal California is already being affected. \nThese effects are still small and highly localized. Much larger effects come with storms enhanced by sea level.\nHigher sea level can worsen storm damage\nWarmer ocean water fuels tropical storms. It\u2019s one reason forecasters are warning of a busy 2024 hurricane season.\nTropical storms pick up moisture over warm water and transfer it to cooler areas. The warmer the water, the faster the storm can form, the quicker it can intensify and the longer it can last, resulting in destructive storms and heavy downpours that can flood cities even far from the coasts.\nWhen these storms now come in on top of already higher sea levels, the waves and storm surge can dramatically increase coastal flooding.\n\nTropical cyclones caused more than $1.3 trillion in damage in the U.S. from 1980 to 2023, with an average cost of $22.8 billion per storm. Much of that cost has been absorbed by federal taxpayers.\nIt is not just tropical storms. Maine saw what can happen when a winter storm in January 2024 generated tides 5 feet above normal that filled coastal streets with seawater.\n\nWhat does that mean for the economy?\nThe possible future economic damages from sea-level rise are not known because the pace and extent of rising sea levels are unknown. \nOne estimate puts the costs from sea-level rise and storm surge alone at over $990 billion this century, with adaptation measures able to reduce this by only $100 billion. These estimates include direct property damage and damage to infrastructure such as transportation, water systems and ports. Not included are impacts on agriculture from saltwater intrusion into aquifers that support agriculture.\nMarine heat waves leave fisheries in trouble\nRising ocean temperatures are also affecting marine life through extreme events, known as marine heat waves, and more gradual long-term shifts in temperature.\nIn spring 2024, one third of the global ocean was experiencing heat waves. Corals are struggling through their fourth global bleaching event on record as warm ocean temperatures cause them to expel the algae that live in their shells and give the corals color and provide food. While corals sometimes recover from bleaching, about half of the world\u2019s coral reefs have died since 1950, and their future beyond the middle of this century is bleak.\n\nLosing coral reefs is about more than their beauty. Coral reefs serve as nurseries and feeding grounds for thousands of species of fish. By NOAA\u2019s estimate, about half of all federally managed fisheries, including snapper and grouper, rely on reefs at some point in their life cycle.\nWarmer waters cause fish to migrate to cooler areas. This is particularly notable with species that like cold water, such as lobsters, which have been steadily migrating north to flee warming seas. Once-robust lobstering in southern New England has declined significantly.\n\nIn the Gulf of Alaska, rising temperatures almost wiped out the snow crabs, and a $270 million fishery had to be completely closed for two years. A major heat wave off the Pacific coast extended over several years in the 2010s and disrupted fishing from Alaska to Oregon.\nThis won\u2019t turn around soon\nThe accumulated ocean heat and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will continue to affect ocean temperatures for centuries, even if countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 as hoped. So, while ocean temperatures fluctuate year to year, the overall trend is likely to continue upward for at least a century.\nThere is no cold-water tap that we can simply turn on to quickly return ocean temperatures to \u201cnormal,\u201d so communities will have to adapt while the entire planet works to slow greenhouse gas emissions to protect ocean economies for the future.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Oceans, Tourism, Economics, Fisheries, Corals, Recreation, Sea level rise, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Warming oceans, Ocean heating","role":"assistant"}]}

Together, too much heat and humidity can make you sick. And in severe cases, it can cause your body to shut down.\nMeteorologists talk about the risk of heat and humidity using the heat index, but it can be confusing.\nI\u2019m a risk communication researcher. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the heat index and some better ways meteorologists can talk about the risks of extreme heat.\n\nWhat is the heat index, and how is it measured?\nHeat index is the combination of the actual air temperature and relative humidity:\n\nAir temperature is how hot or cold the air is, which depends on factors such as the time of day, season of the year and local weather conditions. It is what your thermometer reads in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. \nRelative humidity compares how much water vapor is in the air with how much water vapor the air could hold at that temperature. It\u2019s expressed as a percentage.\n\nThe heat index tells you what it \u201cfeels like\u201d outside when you factor in the humidity. For example, if it\u2019s 98 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 Celsius) with 55% relative humidity, it might feel more like a scorching 117 F (47.2 C).\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch: Heat index is measured in shady conditions to prevent the sun\u2019s angle from affecting its calculation. This means if you\u2019re in direct sunlight, it will feel even hotter.\nApparent temperature, alerts and wet bulb\n\u201cApparent temperature\u201d is another term you might hear this summer.\nApparent temperature is the \u201cfeels like\u201d temperature. It considers not only temperature and humidity but also wind speed. This means it can tell us both the heat index and wind chill \u2013 or the combination of the temperature and wind speed. When conditions are humid, it feels hotter, and when it\u2019s windy, it feels colder. \nWe found that apparent temperature is even less well understood than the heat index, possibly due to the word apparent having various interpretations.\n\nThere are a few other ways you may hear meteorologists talk about heat.\nWet bulb globe temperature considers temperature, humidity, wind and sunlight. It\u2019s especially useful for those who spend time outdoors, such as workers and athletes, because it reflects conditions in direct sunlight.\nHeatRisk is a new tool developed by the National Weather Service that uses colors and numbers to indicate heat risks for various groups. More research is needed, however, to know whether this type of information helps people make decisions.\nIn many places, the National Weather Service also issues alerts such as excessive heat watches, warnings and advisories.\nThe risk is getting lost in translation\nKnowing about heat and humidity is important, but my colleagues and I have found that the term heat index is not well understood. \nWe recently conducted 16 focus groups across the United States, including areas with dry heat, like Phoenix, and more humid areas, like Houston. Many of the people involved didn\u2019t know what the heat index was. Some confused it with the actual air temperature. Most also didn\u2019t understand what the alerts meant, how serious they were or when they should protect themselves.\nIn our discussions with these groups, we found that meteorologists could get across the risk more clearly if, instead of using terms like heat index, they focus on explaining what it feels like outside and why those conditions are dangerous. \nWatches, warnings and advisories could be improved by telling people what temperatures to expect, when and steps they can take to stay safe.\n\nClimate change is exacerbating heat risks by making extreme heat more common, intense and long-lasting. This means clear communication is necessary to help people understand their risk and how they can protect themselves. \nWhat you can do to protect yourself\nWith both hot and humid conditions, extra precautions are necessary to protect your health. When you get hot, you sweat. When sweat evaporates, this helps the body cool down. But humidity prevents the sweat from evaporating. If sweat cannot evaporate, the body has trouble lowering or regulating its temperature.\nAlthough everyone is at risk of health issues in high heat, people over 65, pregnant women, infants and young children can have trouble cooling their bodies down or may run a higher risk of becoming dehydrated. Certain health conditions or medications can also increase a person\u2019s risk of heat-related illness, so it\u2019s important to talk to your doctor about your risk.\nHeat illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke, are preventable if you take the right steps. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention focuses on staying cool, hydrated and informed.\n\nStay cool: Use air conditioning in your home, or spend time in air-conditioned spaces, such as a shopping mall or public library. Limit or reschedule your exercise and other outdoor plans that occur in the middle of the day when it is hottest.\nStay hydrated: Drink more water than you might otherwise, even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty, so your body can regulate its temperature by sweating. But avoid sugary drinks, caffeine or drinks with alcohol, because these can cause you to become dehydrated.   \nStay informed: Know the signs of heat illness and symptoms that can occur, such as dizziness, weakness, thirst, heavy sweating and nausea. Know what to do and when to get help, because heat illnesses can be deadly.\n\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Heat, Global warming, Extreme weather, Heat wave, Humidity, Extreme heat, Heat index","role":"assistant"}]}

They tend to be more optimistic, recharge by socialising and enjoy social interaction. \nOn the other end of the spectrum, introverts are more likely to be quiet, deep thinkers, who recharge by being alone and learn by observing (but aren\u2019t necessarily shy). \nBut what if you\u2019re neither an introvert or extrovert \u2013 or you\u2019re a bit of both? Another category might fit better: ambiverts. They\u2019re the middle of the spectrum and are also called \u201csocial introverts\u201d.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is an ambivert?\nThe term ambivert emerged in 1923. While it was not initially embraced as part of the introvert-extrovert spectrum, more recent research suggests ambiverts are a distinct category.\nAmbiverts exhibit traits of both extroverts and introverts, adapting their behaviour based on the situation. It may be that they socialise well but need solitude and rest to recharge, and they intuitively know when to do this.  \nAmbiverts seems to have the following characteristics: \n\ngood communication skills, as a listener and speaker\nability to be a peacemaker if conflict occurs\nleadership and negotiation skills, especially in teams\ncompassion and understanding for others. \n\nSome research suggests ambiverts make up a significant portion of the population, with about two-thirds of people falling into this category.\nWhat makes someone an ambivert?\nPersonality is thought to be 50% inherited, with the remaining being influenced by environmental factors and individual experiences.\nEmerging research has found physical locations of genes on chromosomes closely aligned with extroversion-introversion traits.\nSo, chances are, if you are a blend of the two styles as an ambivert, one of your parents may be too.\nWhat do ambiverts tend to be good at?\n\nOne area of research focus in recent decades has been personality type and job satisfaction. One study examined 340 introverts, extroverts and ambiverts in sales careers. \nIt has always been thought extroverts were more successful with sales. However, the author found ambiverts were more influential and successful. \nThey may have a sales advantage because of their ability to read the situation and modify their behaviour if they notice a customer is not interested, as they\u2019re able to reflect and adapt. \nAmbiverts stress less than introverts\nGenerally, people lower in extroversion have higher stress levels. One study found introverts experience more stress than both ambiverts and extroverts.\nIt may be that highly sensitive or introverted individuals are more susceptible to worry and stress due to being more perfectionistic. \nAmbiverts are adept at knowing when to be outgoing and when to be reflective, showcasing a high degree of situational awareness. This may contribute to their overall wellbeing because of how they handle stress.\nWhat do ambiverts tend to struggle with?\nAmbiverts may overextend themselves attempting to conform or fit in with many social settings. This is termed \u201coveradaptation\u201d and may force ambiverts to feel uncomfortable and strained, ultimately resulting in stress or burnout.\n\nBut personality traits aren\u2019t fixed\nRegardless of where you sit on the scale of introversion through to extroversion, the reality is it may not be fixed. Different situations may be more comfortable for introverts to be social, and extroverts may be content with quieter moments. \nAnd there are also four other key personality traits \u2013 openness to experience, conscientiousness, agreeableness and neuroticism \u2013 which we all possess in varying levels, and are expressed in different ways, alongside our levels of extroversion.  \nThere is also evidence our personality traits can change throughout our life spans are indeed open to change.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Psychology, Health, Introverts, Extroverts, Consumer health, Personality types, Personality tests","role":"assistant"}]}

The state government this week proposed new minimum requirements for rental properties and rooming or boarding houses. These changes would be phased in from October 2025.\nThe new standards will greatly improve the quality and comfort of rental housing. They will also make it cheaper to live in. \nIt\u2019s the most far-reaching response by any Australian government to the huge and well-documented problems of affordability and poor conditions in our rental housing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy are better standards needed?\nAbout a third of Australian households live in rental housing. They include many of our most disadvantaged and vulnerable households.\nThe sector also has some of our poorest-quality housing. Many rental properties are energy-inefficient and poorly maintained.\nThe proposed standards are likely to help households by:\n\nreducing energy bills to help manage the cost of living\nimproving health and wellbeing by providing more stable and comfortable temperatures in the home and reducing damp and mould\nreducing environmental impacts by cutting energy use and moving away from gas appliances.\n\nThis government intervention is a step in the right direction. Market-based approaches to improving the quality and performance of private rental properties are failing to deliver. \nState and local governments have increased financial support for retrofitting  housing to improve its performance. However, research has found uptake by landlords has been limited.\nMinimum standards have been successfully introduced overseas. In the UK, for example, landlords must ensure their properties achieve at least a level E energy performance certificate (A is best). The aim is to lift the bottom of the market to a new minimum standard over time.\nWhat is being proposed?\nThis table shows the key changes proposed in Victoria. \n\nA landlord would only be required to make these changes to the property at the start of a new lease or at the end of an appliance\u2019s lifespan. This will help spread the costs over time. But it also means tenants might not see immediate improvements come October 2025.\nThe government estimates the average extra cost of delivering all requirements at A$5,519 per property. Of course, the cost impact will vary. Some homes will already meet some or all of the new standards.\nLandlords who want to make improvements before October 2025 could get Victorian Energy Upgrade subsidies. But these are only available for voluntary activities. This financial support will not be available for landlords once the minimum standards become mandatory.\nThis table shows the estimated extra costs of the new standards compared to business as usual.\n\nWait, weren\u2019t minimum standards already in place?\nVictoria introduced minimum standards for rental properties in 2021. These include:\n\na fixed heater (not portable) in good working order in the main living area\na stovetop in good working order with two or more burners\ninside rooms, corridors and hallways have access to light to make the areas functional\nall rooms free from mould and damp caused by or related to the building structure\nwindows in rooms likely to be used as bedrooms or living areas fitted with curtains or blinds that can be closed, block light and provide privacy.\n\nThe aim of the proposed new changes is not just to deliver basic rental housing, but housing that is safe, comfortable and energy-efficient.\n\nWhat challenges will these changes bring?\nPotential challenges include:\n\nmany landlords are already financially stretched and may pass on improvement costs to tenants or exit the market, but research indicates the likely impact of these responses is low\nchanges will supercharge the retrofit industry, so strict governance will be needed to avoid issues with \u201ccowboy\u201d operators, as happened with schemes such as the Home Insulation Program \u2013 the so-called \u201cpink batts\u201d scheme\nlabour shortages across the construction industry mean more workers will have to be found to deliver these upgrades\nwe don\u2019t yet know what the processes will be for checking compliance and providing recourse if upgrades fall short of requirements\ntenants may hesitate to assert their rights because affordable rental housing is so hard to find\nsafeguards will be needed to protect tenants from rent increases \nthere is a risk of gentrification if landlords decide to comprehensively retrofit and renovate homes.\n\nFinally, even though this is an important milestone, more needs to be done. For example, having only one heater in the living room means tenants will need to use portable electric heaters in bedrooms or run the risk of mould developing. Similarly, having only one air conditioner in the living room means people will suffer during hot summer nights unless they sleep in that room. \nRenters in the rest of Australia are missing out on these important protections. Progress is urgently needed across the country if we, as a nation, are going to ensure renters have equal access to safe, cost-efficient, resilient and low-emission homes.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Victoria, Affordable housing, Tenancy laws, Rental housing, Rental market, Rental costs, Landlords, Better Cities, Tenants' rights, Housing standards, Private rental sector","role":"assistant"}]}

Adopted by all UN member nations, the SDGs offer a frame for an ambitious plan to transform our world for the better. \nEngaging young adults in meaningful discussions can lead to transformative learning \u2014 and action is key to meeting local and global targets.\nUniversities across Canada and the world are working towards making institutional commitments towards sustainability and engaging students in this also. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization launched a Reflect-Share-Act framework in 2020 to assist anyone in acquiring the skills and knowledge needed to promote sustainable development in their community. \nOver the past two years, I participated in a sustainability fellowship program at the University of Saskatchewan. As part of this, I redesigned a marketing class using the UNESCO framework to include sustainability learning outcomes, activities and assessments.\n\n\n\n\n\nI used a survey at the start and end of each term to measure changes in student perceptions around sustainability and students\u2019 own belief in their ability to enact change. The results showed consistent increases in terms of knowledge about what sustainability is and student optimism around how to make change happen. \nMany aspects of sustainability\nWhen most people think about sustainability, their first thought is usually about the environment or climate change. However, the UN global goals also address other aspects of sustainability, including:\n\nelimination of poverty (SDG 1);\nresponsible consumption and production (SDG 12);\ngender equality (SDG 5);\nand quality education (SDG 4). \n\n\nI focused my efforts on an introductory marketing class that I\u2019d taught several times. I introduced sustainable development and the SDGs at the start of the term with the promise of making specific connections to marketing concepts throughout the class. \nStudents\u2019 ideas for sustainable behaviours\nThe focus of marketing often involves persuasion and considering how to drive sales\/purchases. When talking about consumer behaviour and revisiting traditional marketing concepts, I shared examples of overconsumption (for example, purchasing water bottles in every new colour that comes out) and asked students to consider how they might reduce their own consumption. \nI pointed students towards a UN resource, The Lazy Person\u2019s Guide to Saving the World for initial ideas \u2014 and then asked students to brainstorm actions they could take as marketers to contribute to SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production and other SDGs in their future workplaces. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How marketing classes can rescue 'ugly produce' from becoming food waste\n\n\n\n\nStudents shared ideas such as evaluating the materials used in packaging and finding new ways to connect with customers to reduce sales-related travel and their own carbon footprint. \n\nStudents were able to think about the impacts of their decisions and identify tangible ways to contribute to sustainable development. Next year I\u2019m going to take the activity a step further by turning their ideas into an open resource for marketers wanting to prioritize sustainability.\nHere are some lessons learned from engaging business students in reflecting, sharing and acting on sustainability.\nLesson #1: Lower your defences\nI\u2019ve never been good at showing vulnerability. Dominant academic culture is based on having a strong defence and not showing weakness. I\u2019ve found, however, that sharing my uncertainties in the face of global challenges has led to more conversation and connection with students. \nWhen I talk about worrying about how the world is running out of water, and discuss political and humanitarian issues around water security, I\u2019ve found that students make great efforts to address these by finding solutions that exist now and might be invented in the future. \nIt\u2019s OK not to have all the answers and see what happens.\nLesson #2: Authenticity is king (or queen)\nStudents can be very perceptive. I\u2019ve learned from feedback in course evaluations and informal chats that students pay attention to what I model, and the importance of being authentic. From my choice of clothing to the water bottle I bring to the classroom, these decisions matter to students.  \nI have open conversations where I talk about an issue, such as the horrific environmental impacts of fast fashion in Ghana, as narrated in Aja Barber\u2019s book, Consumed: The Need for Collective Change: Colonialism, Climate Change and Consumerism. Then I talk about my consumption choices in light of this issue. \nIt helps students to see the connections between these issues and the everyday (better) choices we can all make.\nLesson #3: Don\u2019t take it personally\nI\u2019ve found that some students are cynical about setting sustainability goals. \nIt\u2019s not that surprising \u2014 after all, I teach in a business school, and there is long-standing discussion about capitalist-forward business schools focussed on maximizing profits at the expense of everything else.\nOthers are even suspicious of the United Nations. Some refuse to take any responsibility for sustainable development and put it on corporations to solve the world\u2019s problems. \nIt\u2019s important not to take criticism personally. I\u2019ve found that going deeper and examining these opinions can lead to interesting discussions. With regards to cynicism about the SDGs, I usually respond with questions such as: \u201cWhat makes you think that? What have you read that leads you to those conclusions?\u201d \nI\u2019ve learned educators need to listen and learn non-judgmentally about how young people feel. They have valid reasons to react strongly about generations of business leaders who have recklessly pursued wealth with complete disregard for the impacts.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      What striking education workers and climate activists have in common\n\n\n\n\n\nLesson #4: It\u2019s not just about \u2018what\u2019 but about \u2018how\u2019\nI\u2019ve realized that how I engage with students on important global topics like sustainability is just as important as the content I share. UNESCO has said sustainability education should emphasize experiential, inquiry-based, problem-solving, interdisciplinary systems approaches and critical thinking. \nApproaches need to enable student action and not leave them feeling like the world\u2019s issues are too large for them to tackle. Using this definition along with the Reflect-Share-Act framework, I was able to help students move beyond considering large, often daunting global issues to a place where they can take tangible actions and affect change.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Consumerism, Business schools, Business education, Post-secondary education, Climate crisis, UN sustainable development goals (SDG)","role":"assistant"}]}

In Australia, a young girl falls ill after a foreign holiday and is rushed to hospital. In Mexico, another man, already ill and bed-bound, becomes seriously unwell and dies. Each of these recent cases was caused by a different strain of influenza virus. In each case, it was an animal virus, which should not normally have turned up in humans at all. Should stories like this worry us?\nWhen stories like this hit the news (and for influenza viruses, this happens quite often), journalists write to virologists and ask: how worried are you about this one? \nThe honest answer is that how any virologist really feels about a story depends on a lot of things, including our personalities: some of us are natural optimists, while others tend to catastrophise. But our professional background does give us an idea of what to look for in a news story about a novel virus. When you next read about a novel virus in the news yourself, these are the questions that can help you decide how much of a worry it might be.\nHow far has it got?\nThis is usually the first question. It\u2019s actually really hard for a virus to adapt to growing well in a new host species. Even influenza viruses \u2013 basically bird viruses, but notorious for causing repeated human pandemics \u2013 only manage it every few decades. \n\n\n\n\n\nFor a virus, crossing into people from a different animal host is a staged process. (I\u2019m writing \u201cpeople\u201d, but it\u2019s the same logic if you\u2019re worried about a virus crossing between any two host species, say, bird flu adapting to spread in cattle.) \nHave people been exposed to the new virus and developed immune responses, but with no signs of infection? If there has been a \u201cspillover\u201d infection of a human (whether or not this caused serious illness), is there any sign that the virus has adapted enough to spread onwards to other people? And if the virus is now spreading among people, is that spread still at a point where it can be contained?\nHow much do we know?\nSurveillance is hard work that requires resources and cooperation, but it is hugely important in understanding and controlling outbreaks. So what do we look for? \nTesting people for immune responses to a virus (serology) tells us who has previously been exposed. Sequencing viral genomes (from infected people or from the environment) tells us where the virus is now, but it also lets us work out how it is spreading and how it is changing. \nWe can do this because viruses mutate quickly. Lining up the differences in their genetic sequences lets us build family trees (\u201cphylogenetic trees\u201d), which we can use to reconstruct how the virus got to particular places at particular times. \nAre we looking at one big outbreak or lots of separate outbreaks? Family trees can show us this. Looking at the changes in the virus\u2019 genome also lets us look for any telltale signs that it is adapting to a new species \u2013 assuming we understand the virus well enough to work that out.\nWhat are we dealing with?\nThe better we understand a virus, the more we can anticipate what it might do next. For some very well-studied viruses, like the influenza viruses, we know some of the genetic changes that are warning signs of adaptation to a new host species. \nWhat else can we look for? We worry more about viruses jumping between similar host species, because this is easier for the virus to do. Influenza that\u2019s already in a mammal is closer to being able to infect us than influenza from a bird.\nWe can look at likely routes of transmission \u2013 a respiratory virus is likely to spread more quickly than a virus spread through sexual contact. We can also try to guess at the outcomes of infection \u2013 viruses that cause serious disease are concerning, but in terms of spread, we also worry about less serious cases, which could lead to people spreading the virus without realising it.\nHowever, viruses are tricky things, and in practice, it\u2019s really hard to predict what they will do. \nThe current outbreak of H5N1 influenza A viruses in cattle is a good example of this. An influenza A virus infecting cattle and then spreading through milk were both huge surprises. And while H5N1 is known to be capable of causing very severe disease, it seems that some cattle are carrying the virus without serious illness. \nExperimental virology, in which animals and cell cultures are infected and studied under controlled conditions in secure laboratories, can be essential for understanding what a virus is really capable of.\nCould it get worse?\nAdapting to humans is hard for a virus, so anything that gives a virus more chances to pull this off is a concern. Sustained outbreaks are more of a risk than one-off cases.\nWe worry more about viruses in animals with close contact with humans. H5N1 spreading in North American cattle is more worrying than H5N1 spreading in South American elephant seals. \nWe worry about viruses taking shortcuts to adapting. For influenza viruses, this can happen in hosts like pigs that can pick up more than one virus at the same time and allow them to swap bits of their genome with each other.\nAnd we worry about people doing anything that gives a virus more chances to get used to them. Things like drinking unpasteurised milk in areas where it could carry H5N1 influenza viruses, for example.\n\nWhat would the worst case look like?\nWhat would happen if things did get worse? Do we already have vaccines to this virus or to one very like it? Is there the capacity for making large numbers of those vaccines and distributing them to large numbers of people? Do we already have antiviral drugs? Do we know what\u2019s needed to manage the symptoms caused by the virus effectively? Here, at least, it helps to face a virus like influenza that we\u2019ve already been trying to fight for a long time.\nThe spread of a new strain of influenza virus around the world is just one of many viral threats, but the H5N1 strain of the virus has been doing a lot of things recently that cause us, as virologists, to watch it with concern. \nWhile isolated cases can be devastating for the people involved, the bigger risk to society comes from viruses that spread \u2013 and H5N1 influenza is now spreading, in US cattle as well as in birds around the world. Importantly though, what it is not doing at the moment is anything that we would associate with it spreading among humans. \nThe current mood among virologists is definitely not what it was in, for example, February 2020, when it became clear that SARS-CoV-2 was spreading uncontrollably among humans. But bird flu is doing enough concerning things at the moment to make us pay close attention to it. Hopefully, if we do that, we can all prevent things becoming a lot more worrying than they are now.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Influenza, Virology, Bird flu, novel virus, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Crowe\u2019s character, troubled actor Tony Miller, is literally possessed by a demon on the set of his latest film, known as \u201cThe Georgetown Project\u201d.\n\nThe Exorcism makes no bones about its engagement with perhaps the most iconic horror film of all time \u2013 The Exorcist. First opening with an ill-fated actor rehearsing his lines as the film\u2019s priest (\u201cshe barfs, she screams, I\u2019m dead\u201d), The Georgetown Project is later positioned as a reboot of The Exorcist, with Tony\u2019s daughter Lee (ably played by Ryan Simpkins) incredulous they\u2019d even attempt it.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis direct connection to The Exorcist is also foregrounded behind the scenes of The Exorcism, with real-life director Joshua John Miller being the son of actor Jason Miller who played Father Damien Karras in the 1973 film, neatly adding to the meta-narrative of The Exorcist itself. \n\nWhile Miller\u2019s historic ties to The Exorcist act as an intriguing hook for the film\u2019s metatextual elements, The Exorcism is also produced by Kevin Williamson, who, alongside director Wes Craven, is widely credited as the godfather of meta horror as the writer of Scream. \nIn fact, it is Scream 3 that comes to mind in The Exorcism\u2019s horror set pieces, with actors inventively killed off on set. It is within these self-referential moments on the set of The Georgetown Project that The Exorcism works best.\nAdam Goldberg\u2019s arrogant director is good value, with his insistence that their The Exorcist remake is not in fact, a horror film, but a \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d. This acts as a nice tongue-in-cheek nod to the post-horror debate and the odd perception that in order to be an important film, you cannot, under any circumstances, be perceived as a horror film.\n\nTrauma and grief\nYet despite the film lightly needling the pretentiousness of the post-horror label, it can\u2019t really resist leaning into a key trope of the recent post-horror cycle \u2013 an emphasis on trauma and grief as a key motivation for a character.\nIn Post Horror (2021), his book on this contemporary cycle of films, David Church dedicates an entire chapter to what he calls Grief, Mourning and the Horrors of Familial Inheritance, in which he notes that, \u201cmany post-horror films feature a major character who seems trapped in an emotional limbo that they are unable to get beyond\u201d.\nWhile The Exorcism by no means fits within the parameters of a post-horror film (its overreliance on jump scares puts paid to that), the amount of grief and trauma attached to Crowe\u2019s character is so excessive to be almost on the verge of parody. The fact that the audience is given this information in almost back-to-back exposition scenes also doesn\u2019t help the feeling that the film is trying a little too hard for pathos. \nYet while this traumatic backstory can sometimes feel laboured, it gives good material to Crowe and Simpkins to sink their teeth into, and they are both reliably strong as the co-leads of the film. However, in terms of the narrative, this emphasis on traumatic backstory ultimately creates a schism between the meta-madness happening on set of The Georgetown Project, and the recurring family discussions around abuse, addiction and loss.  \nThis leads to the elephant in the room, which is Crowe\u2019s turn as the Catholic church\u2019s number one demon defeater in another recent film, The Pope\u2019s Exorcist.\n\nReleased only last year, the serendipity of two Russell Crowe-led exorcism movies arriving in the space of two years invites comparisons, despite both films being very different in their approach and overall intentions. While I\u2019m not looking to christen The Pope\u2019s Exorcist as a contemporary horror masterpiece, it has a sense of humour and lightness on its feet that The Exorcism shows only glimmers of.\nIn the latter, Crowe is hemmed in by a character rendered almost passive, first through his own trauma, and then by the demon that possesses him, with the actor only being allowed to fully unleash his star power in a few of the film\u2019s later set pieces. \nOne thing both The Pope\u2019s Exorcist and The Exorcism do have in common is an unfortunate third-act collapse, with The Exorcism\u2019s finale feeling so rushed that key characters simply fall by the wayside. A case in point being The Georgetown Project\u2019s director, who seems to exist solely for a horrible death scene, only to escape that fate but disappear for the film\u2019s final 20 minutes.\nThe Exorcism is by no means a disaster \u2013 it has two dependable lead performances in Crowe and Simpkins and enjoys some fun with the film-within-a-film setting. But it suffers from a tonal imbalance and a lack of inventive scares overall. If you\u2019re looking for a good time with Russell Crowe and an exorcism, this one sadly comes second best.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Grief, Trauma, Russell Crowe, demonic possession, Horror films, The Exorcist, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Beyond its own worship services, the church has engaged in community outreach and was also home to offices and a rehearsal space for a theatre group.\n\n\n\n\n\nThese dynamics bring into clear view the often-overlooked significance of space in contemporary cities and communities, and the impact a dramatic tragedy has on public imagination and community identity.\n\nBuildings impact their surroundings\nBuilt in 1908, St. Anne\u2019s was immediately noteworthy, standing out for its Byzantine-style inspired by designs originating in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire (like Hagia Sophia in present-day Istanbul). This was in stark contrast to the architectural style typical of the Anglican tradition at the time, particularly the neo-Gothic approach to church design. \nArchitects remind us that buildings make statements and impact their surroundings. Was St. Anne\u2019s intended to be a more Protestant-friendly expression of the Anglican Church than the prominent Anglo-Catholic style of the period? Or was drawing from Eastern Orthodox Christianity meant to inspire a vision of unity across different denominations? \nThe concept behind the design has remained a puzzle and been much debated by art historians like Marylin McKay and Peter Coffman. \nAs Coffman notes, when St. Anne\u2019s was built, some Christian observers objected to the building\u2019s dome because it made them think of a mosque or synagogue. This highlights the impact architecture can have on observers as it aligns or deviates from the attitudes and culture of the community it is located in.\n\nDistinct artwork\nIn 1923, the peculiarity of St. Anne\u2019s was enhanced by the commissioning of a team of artists from the Ontario College of Art to decorate the church interior with Byzantine-style art resembling eastern iconography more than dominant styles in western Christian art. \nMuch of the work was done by three artists (including J.E.H. MacDonald) who would become part of Canada\u2019s famed \u201cGroup of Seven.\u201d The result was a church building unique in Canada, leading many architectural historians to describe it as \u201cirreplaceable.\u201d\nIn recent decades, scholars have emphasized the significance of place for shaping community and identity. Environmental issues, the impact of globalization and the rapid pace of urban redevelopment have elevated the significance of place and geography, prompting new attention on the nature of human identity, belonging and the ethics of decisions over the use of shared space. \nThese reflections have heightened awareness of how power dynamics, cultural meaning and ecological implications affect decisions about the use of space in societies. \nThese considerations are also prominent in dialogues between Indigenous Peoples and their neighbours, in which the importance of the land and one\u2019s relationship to nature are key themes.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Ancient pictograph vandalism at Bon Echo Provincial Park reveals an ongoing disregard for Indigenous history and presence\n\n\n\n\nSpace as \u2018social product\u2019\nAs the French philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefebvre argued, space is not simply inherited from nature, but \u201cis a social product.\u201d Space is shaped by human activity, based on certain goals and preoccupations, and is thus not merely a neutral backdrop. \nLefebvre was particularly concerned with ways that modern capitalism encourages fragmented spaces that prioritize efficiency and consumption over community life and social interaction.  \nMore recently, the German philosopher Peter Sloterdijk discusses space as the venue in which a sense of self is shaped and individual and communal identity formed.\n\nLefebvre\u2019s conception of space helps one understand how the idiosyncratic design of St. Anne\u2019s reflected particular dynamics within Canadian society and culture at the time the church was built \u2014 including the impact of changing demographics, rising cultural diversity and local religious rivalries.\nHow we think about and value space\nLefebvre\u2019s work also highlights how changes in the economy, urban planning and cultural norms modify how people think about, value and organize space. In the late 1990s, St. Anne\u2019s struggled to pay to renovate its leaking roof. One question the St. Anne\u2019s fire highlights is the nature of churches as sites of cultural heritage amid a decline of Christian affiliation in Canada. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Reinventing heritage buildings isn't new at all \u2013 the ancients did it too\n\n\n\n\nSloterdijk\u2019s emphasis on how space shapes identity highlights how the loss of such space can result in a lost sense of identity. This resonates with a theme emphasized by the rector of St. Anne\u2019s, Rev. Don Beyers, following the fire. Beyers describes disorientation and deep emotional turmoil experienced by members of the church and the surrounding neighbourhood. A connection to a place brings meaning to human lives. The loss of a cherished space is often not only painful, but even traumatic.\nThe St. Anne\u2019s community will have to face navigating disaster beyond the emotional expression of comradeship and solidarity in the immediate aftermath, particularly once media interest fades. \nThe leadership of the church appear to be alert to this, and poised to respond. Nevertheless, navigating such disorienting emotional dynamics will be challenging.\nIdentity, space and environment\nIt will be interesting to observe whether the sudden appreciation for the significance of the St. Anne\u2019s space will be lasting, or whether this recognition will quickly fade as the news cycle moves on and the redevelopment frenzy of urban Toronto resumes. Perhaps the media attention to the St. Anne\u2019s fire signals that, at least to some extent, many Canadians are becoming increasingly attuned to connections between identity, space and the environment. \nAs the Osage theologian Tink Tinker writes, \u201ca firm sense of filial attachment to particular place\u201d is related to \u201ca responsibility to relate to the land.\u201d \nIf the tragic fire of St. Anne\u2019s does indeed inspire people to be more attuned to such issues in Canadian society, then perhaps hope can indeed be found even amid this disaster. As Beyers has said in interviews, the people of St. Anne\u2019s believe that new life emerges in the wake of death.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Byzantine art, Churches","role":"assistant"}]}

Acute rheumatic fever, a disease virtually non-existent among non-Indigenous Australians, may damage their heart valves. They are more likely to develop and die from cancer, diabetes, kidney failure and lung disease.\nA First Nations Australian is also more likely to have a low household income, live in overcrowded housing, and is 14 times more likely to be imprisoned. We know socioeconomic inequalities like these create health inequalities. There\u2019s also evidence that cultural factors and experiences of racism compound the problem.\nClosing the health gap between First Nations peoples and non-Indigenous Australians is a national priority. One of the ways to reduce health disparities is by improving the care Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people receive when they\u2019re admitted to hospital. \n\n\n\n\n\nStaff at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Brisbane could see first-hand that our health system wasn\u2019t delivering the care First Nations patients needed. So they sought to develop a culturally informed model of care for First Nations patients with heart disease.\nWe have all worked with this model and were part of a study to trial it. Our results, published recently in The Lancet Global Health, indicate this culturally informed model of care eliminated the gap between First Nations patients and non-Indigenous patients when we looked at heart health outcomes after they left hospital.\nDesigning a culturally informed model of care\nThe model was developed for First Nations patients with acute coronary syndrome. This includes heart attacks and angina, which is chest pain due to disease in the arteries supplying blood to the heart. \nThe project was co-designed with First Nations stakeholders. Training was tailored and delivered to build cultural capability across the cardiology department and to increase staff knowledge of relevant services available to First Nations patients outside the hospital.\nStaff formed formal partnerships with local Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-controlled health organisations. They improved the hospital environment with First Nations artwork and uniforms (displaying First Nations flags and artwork). \nThey brought together a \u201cBetter Cardiac Care\u201d team including an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander hospital liaison officer, a cardiac nurse and a pharmacist. This team visited First Nations patients at their bedside, providing additional support, advocacy, education and care co-ordination. \n\nPatients could confidently ask questions and yarn about their diagnosis and treatment in their own words without feelings of shame or embarrassment. \nThe team was focused on the patient\u2019s needs. For example, they could co-ordinate accommodation for a patient\u2019s relative who was travelling to the hospital from far away. They could tell a patient\u2019s doctor if the patient needed more time to talk or make a decision, or a better explanation. Before the patient left hospital, the team could co-ordinate with the patient\u2019s local chemist to supply their medications and book a follow-up appointment with their GP.\nHow we tested the model\nWe investigated the impact of the model of care by looking at outcomes for First Nations and non-Indigenous patients admitted with heart attacks and angina before and after the model was implemented. \nSpecifically, we collected data on 199 First Nations patients and 440 randomly selected non-Indigenous patients treated in the 24 months before the project began and compared them with 119 First Nations patients and 467 non-Indigenous patients treated in the 12 months after. \nWe particularly wanted to know if patients died, had another heart attack, needed an unexpected stent or coronary artery bypass surgery, or had to urgently come back into hospital within 90 days of being discharged. \nBefore the model was introduced, 34% of First Nations patients had one of those negative outcomes, much higher than the rate of 18% in non-Indigenous patients. Afterwards, these events occurred in 20% of both First Nations and non-Indigenous patients. This was a significant improvement for First Nations patients and eliminated the gap between groups. \nThe most significant improvement was seen in urgent re-admissions, but there were also fewer heart attacks.\n\nFewer heart attacks and hospital admissions are good, but we also needed to ensure patients felt culturally safe, and that their social and emotional needs were being met. \nA related project asked patients and their families about their experience with the model of care. The researchers identified that relationality or connectedness between patients and the team, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander staff, may be key to its success.\nA promising concept\nOur study was not a randomised trial and the control group was historical. So it\u2019s possible factors other than the model of care might have affected the outcomes. The study was also conducted only in a single hospital.\nHowever, we demonstrated that a culturally informed model of care, developed with and for First Nations peoples, can improve clinical outcomes. Better Cardiac Care programs based on this concept have now spread to other Queensland hospitals. \nWe hope similar results can be replicated in many hospitals and in other medical specialities, because improving hospital outcomes is one of many important steps needed to close the health gap for First Nations peoples in Australia.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Cardiovascular disease, Heart disease, Indigenous health, Health, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, Health research, first nations health","role":"assistant"}]}

Federal judges not only dismissed the claims for lack of evidence, but some also penalized the attorneys who filed them.\nJudge Linda Parker of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan acted first, ruling in August 2021 that a lawsuit filed by nine lawyers was \u201ca historic and profound abuse of the judicial process.\u201d In a 110-page opinion, she wrote that the abuses included: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cproffering claims not backed by law; proffering claims not backed by evidence (but instead, speculation, conjecture, and unwarranted suspicion); proffering factual allegations and claims without engaging in the required prefiling inquiry; and dragging out these proceedings.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrint, television, and social media\u201d are where the attorneys could have made their \u201cprotestations\u201d and \u201cconjecture,\u201d Parker wrote. But \u201csuch expressions are neither permitted nor welcomed in a court of law.\u201d\nThe judge imposed three penalties on the attorneys: US$175,000 in defendant legal costs; 12 hours of mandatory instruction on pleading standards and election law; and referrals to the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission and their home state disciplinary authorities for possible suspension or disbarment.\nAppeals to the 6th Circuit and Supreme Court to reverse the sanctions failed. After three years of litigation, the Michigan-ordered penalties still stand.\n\n\u2018Fantastical\u2019 claims\nCourts in other states have taken similar action to hold accountable attorneys who filed abusive or frivolous lawsuits challenging presidential election results:\nColorado: A federal district court penalized two attorneys, Ernest Walker and Gary Fielder, for filing a complaint seeking $160 billion in damages from 19 defendants for alleged misconduct related to the 2020 presidential election. After finding its claims were \u201cfantastical\u201d and \u201cfiled in bad faith,\u201d the court ordered Walker and Fielder to pay defendants\u2019 attorney fees totaling $187,000. Appeals to the 10th Circuit and Supreme Court failed.\nArizona: A federal district court imposed similar sanctions on three attorneys \u2013 Andrew Parker, Kurt Olsen and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz \u2013 who challenged the 2020 presidential election results in Arizona. The court found their complaint contained \u201cfalse, misleading, and unsupported factual assertions\u201d and \u201cdid not have an adequate factual or legal basis.\u201d It ordered the attorneys to pay defendants\u2019 attorney fees totaling $122,200. The attorneys have appealed.\nFlorida: One federal district court even confronted a 193-page lawsuit filed by Donald Trump in 2022, claiming 31 defendants disseminated false information about him to rig the 2016 presidential election. The court wrote: \u201cThis case should never have been brought. \u2026 No reasonable lawyer would have filed it.\u201d The court ordered Trump and his lead counsel, Alina Habba, to pay defendants\u2019 attorney fees totaling $938,000. Both are appealing. \nThese cases create a solid body of precedent for inflicting penalties on attorneys who file abusive pleadings challenging election results. \nSuspension and disbarment\nIn addition to courts penalizing attorneys for inappropriate filings, bar association disciplinary authorities in multiple states have initiated proceedings to suspend or disbar those attorneys from practicing law in their jurisdictions. Despite lengthy procedures involving multiple steps met by aggressive litigation in opposition, those disciplinary proceedings are nearing final action.\nIn New York, the key disciplinary authority found \u201cuncontroverted evidence\u201d that Rudy Giuliani, who served as legal counsel to President Trump and his campaign, \u201ccommunicated demonstrably false and misleading statements to courts, lawmakers and the public.\u201d It ordered his immediate suspension from the practice of law in New York pending further proceedings. The D.C. Bar Association, relying on the New York action and without conducting its own fact-finding, did the same in the District of Columbia. \nWhile no further proceedings occurred in New York to permanently disbar Giuliani, the D.C. Bar\u2019s disciplinary authority issued a 2024 report recommending his disbarment in that jurisdiction.. \nFocused on his actions in Pennsylvania, the 2024 report states that he violated the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Responsibility by filing a lawsuit seeking \u201cto disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of Pennsylvania voters without the slightest factual basis for doing so.\u201d It concludes \u201cdisbarment is the only sanction that will protect the public, the courts, and the integrity of the legal profession, and deter other lawyers from launching similarly baseless claims.\u201d The disbarment recommendation is now under review by the D.C. Bar\u2019s final disciplinary authority.\nIn similar proceedings against another attorney, the D.C. Bar\u2019s disciplinary authority issued a preliminary finding that Jeffrey Clark, former acting head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, also violated D.C. ethics rules and should be sanctioned. The move was in response to Clark\u2019s alleged efforts to help Trump overturn the 2020 election results.\nComparable disciplinary actions have taken place in other states.\nThe California Bar\u2019s disciplinary authority recommended disbarment of John Eastman, a law professor who filed abusive pleadings and engaged in other unethical conduct while representing President Trump and the Trump campaign. \n\nWhen the Georgia State Bar\u2019s Disciplinary Board asked Trump campaign attorney Lin Wood to undergo a mental health evaluation, he sued to prevent it. A federal district court dismissed his suit, and his appeal failed. In 2023, Wood announced his permanent retirement from the practice of law.\nThe Michigan Attorney Disciplinary Board denied multiple motions by the attorneys who filed abusive suits there to dismiss pending disbarment proceedings. \nNot all state disciplinary authorities prevailed. Sidney Powell, who represented Trump and his campaign, won dismissal of ethics charges brought against her in Texas. However, she still faces possible disbarment in Michigan and pled guilty to criminal charges in Georgia relating to the 2020 presidential election there.\nJudicial system integrity\nMany attorneys who filed abusive pleadings challenging the 2020 presidential election have paid a price, incurring litigation costs, judicial condemnation and reputational damage. Some no longer practice law.\nThe legal community\u2019s tough oversight should make attorneys think twice before misusing U.S. courts, but still unknown is whether past disciplinary efforts will deter any potential misconduct following the 2024 presidential election. \nWhat is known is that the integrity of the U.S. judicial system is only as strong as its commitment to the facts.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"US Supreme Court, Donald Trump, US courts, Rudy Giuliani, 2020 US elections, Alan Dershowitz, Federal courts, John Eastman","role":"assistant"}]}

Inequities remained in children\u2019s health, development and wellbeing.\nThis suggests income support is part of what is needed, but not the only thing. Research from low and middle-income countries finds that \u201cstacked\u201d cash-plus programs that include services such as healthcare are more effective than cash alone.\nThe measures introduced during the first year of COVID have shown us it\u2019s possible to give low-income families much more financial support.

Similarly, Tehran\u2019s arms shipments to Russia are well known and have prompted complaints and sanctions from the West.\nBut Tehran has received little coverage of its military intervention in another deadly conflict: Sudan\u2019s civil war. \nSince that conflict started in April 2023, it has killed at least 13,000 people, injured over 33,000 others and displaced millions more. After years of relative peace, people are once again being massacred in the southern region of Darfur.\nIn the immediate aftermath of fighting breaking out between two rival factions of Sudan\u2019s military government, Iran limited its involvement to supplying humanitarian aid.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut that policy didn\u2019t last long. Between December 2023 and January 2024, Tehran supplied several Mohajer-6 midrange reconnaissance and combat drones to President Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and his Sudanese Armed Forces, or SAF.\nIn February, the drones helped the SAF take territory from Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as \u201cHemedti,\u201d and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, during an offensive in the city of Omdurman.\n\nWhile the conflict in Sudan has gotten less global attention than those in Ukraine and Gaza, it is strategically significant for Tehran. As an expert on  Iran\u2019s foreign policy, I see how Tehran is increasingly using involvement in African conflict zones to advance the country\u2019s military, commercial and particularly geopolitical goals. It follows a similar trajectory as Iran\u2019s involvement in Ethiopia during the Tigray war of 2020-22.\nProjecting power\nMilitarily and commercially, drone exports to the SAF have been a continuation of Iran\u2019s actions since the expiration of a U.N. arms embargo against Tehran in October 2020.\nSince then, Iran has delivered surveillance and attack drones not only to its quasi- and nonstate proxies and partners in the Middle East \u2013 such as Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen \u2013 but also increasingly to states outside the region such as Ethiopia, Russia, Tajikistan and Venezuela.\nIran has done this to project power, strengthen alliances and influence conflicts in the Middle East and other regions. At the same time, it can prove a lucrative source of income for the Iranian economy, as well as a showcase for the country\u2019s technology. While it is difficult to determine the precise revenue Iran has received from military drone exports, the estimated value of the global market in 2022 was US$12.55 billion, a figure expected to reach $14.14 billion in 2023 and $35.60 billion in 2030.\nIn regards to Sudan, arming the SAF helps both Iran\u2019s wider geopolitical goals and its competition with regional rivals, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Israel. \nRogue states\nIran-Sudan relations date back to 1989, when Tehran backed the coup led by Omar al-Bashir, who later became the president of Sudan. During the 1990s and 2000s, Iran offered development assistance and military aid to Sudan. It exported tractors there and stationed naval vessels at Sudanese ports in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea.\n\nAlong these strategic routes and shipping lanes, Tehran exported oil to African countries and smuggled weapons to regional clients, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Palestinian militants in Gaza. \nAs a fellow so-called rogue state subjected to U.S. sanctions and embargoes, Sudan provided diplomatic support to Tehran throughout the period. \nIt recognized Iran\u2019s right to pursue a nuclear program and voted against U.N. General Assembly resolutions condemning Tehran\u2019s human rights record. From 1979 to 2021, Sudan ranked as Iran\u2019s third-largest trading partner in Africa and accounted for 3% of its average annual trade with the continent.\nBut between 2013 and 2016, Iran-Sudan relations suffered a series of severe setbacks. In 2014, Sudan closed Iran\u2019s cultural center and expelled its diplomatic officials for purportedly proselytizing Shiism in a predominantly Sunni country. Two years later, in 2016, it and other countries in the Horn of Africa cut formal ties with Tehran.\nThese setbacks resulted from Iran disengaging from Sudan and Africa to concentrate on nuclear diplomacy with the United States and other world powers. They also coincided with growing military, diplomatic and economic assistance from Saudi Arabia and the UAE to Sudan and other states in the Horn of Africa in exchange for joining the Saudi-led coalition against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen.\nThis assistance was especially enticing to Sudan as it confronted isolation and economic adversity as a result of an International Criminal Court arrest warrant for al-Bashir, the secession of oil-rich South Sudan and the imposition of intensified sanctions by the U.S.\nDespite Iran and Sudan subsequently participating in multilateral meetings on agricultural cooperation, the bilateral relations between the countries never fully recovered.\nMaking inroads in the Horn\nThe civil war has provided an opportunity for Iran to correct course with Sudan. Supporting the SAF can help Tehran salvage relations with Sudan while also countering or containing Saudi and Emirate influence in the country and the wider continent.\nTehran aspires to assist al-Burhan and the SAF win the war and take back control of the state. \nGiving assistance to the SAF also fits a dynamic that predates the war and again relates to Iran\u2019s battle for influence with Saudi Arabia. In 2019, while Hemedti served alongside al-Burhan in the Transitional Military Council after al-Bashir\u2019s ouster by a coup, he visited Saudi Arabia and pledged support for it against Iran and the Houthis.\nNonetheless, supporting the SAF is not without risks for Iran.\nFor starters, a victory for al-Burhan and the SAF is far from certain. Since October 2023, the RSF has taken some key states, including the capital of Khartoum and the breadbasket of Gezira. In February 2024, the SAF launched an offensive in Omdurman and made gains there. However, the overall balance may still tilt in the RSF\u2019s favor.\nAnd unlike the wars in Syria and Ukraine, in Sudan, Tehran has found itself in the awkward position of supporting an adversary of Russia, which sponsors the RSF.\nAnd contrary to the Ethiopia conflict, in which Iran supported the government against rebel groups alongside Turkey and the UAE, Tehran and Abu Dhabi are competing for influence in Sudan by backing the SAF and RSF, respectively. Outside the military realm, the UAE has a sizable economic edge over Iran as Sudan\u2019s largest export partner and second largest import partner.\nFueling conflict\nEven if al-Burhan were to emerge victorious, it\u2019s not a given that Iran\u2019s position in Sudan would significantly improve or its influence grow. \nIran is constrained by being a Shiite power; Sudan is a Sunni-majority country. And even before Sudan severed ties with Iran and descended into another civil war, it had long accepted agricultural, commercial, developmental and military assistance from Iran\u2019s regional rivals, Saudi Arabia and Israel. \nAfter Khartoum joined the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, it normalized relations with Tel Aviv through the Abraham Accords in return for diplomatic and economic incentives from the U.S. \nTime will tell whether Iran\u2019s military intervention in Sudan marks a turning point in bilateral relations, or whether it\u2019s nothing more than a weapons transfer in another civil conflict fueled by foreign intervention.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Africa, Horn of Africa, Saudi Arabia, Iran, UAE, Ethiopia, Sudan, Civil war, Omar al-Bashir, Arms exports, Abraham Accords, Tigray war","role":"assistant"}]}

This includes respiration: producing energy from stored carbohydrates, proteins and fats while releasing carbon dioxide and water vapour. (Ever found a sprouting potato in your pantry?)\nOn top of that, fresh produce also spoils easily thanks to various microbes \u2013 both harmless and ones that can cause disease, called pathogens. \nSimply chucking things in the fridge won\u2019t solve the problem, as different types of plants will react differently to how they\u2019re stored. So, how can you combat food waste and keep produce fresh for longer? Fortunately, there are some helpful tips.\n\n\n\n\n\nFreshness and quality begin at the farm\nFarmers always aim to harvest produce when it\u2019s at an optimal condition, but both pre-harvest and post-harvest factors will affect freshness and quality even before you buy it.\nPre-harvest factors are agricultural, such as climatic conditions, soil type and water availability. Post-harvest factors include washing and cleaning after harvesting, transportation and distribution, processing and packaging, and storage.\nAs consumers we can\u2019t directly control these factors \u2013 sometimes the veggies we buy just won\u2019t be as good. But we can look out for things that will affect the produce once we bring it home.\nOne major thing to look out for is bruised, wounded or damaged produce. This can happen at any stage of post-harvest handling, and can really speed up the decay of your veggies and fruit. \nMoisture loss through damaged skin speeds up deterioration and nutrient loss. The damage also makes it easier for spoilage microbes to get in.\nTo wash or not to wash?\nYou don\u2019t need to wash your produce before storing it. A lot of what we buy has already been washed commercially. In fact, if you wash your produce and can\u2019t get it completely dry, the added moisture could speed up decay in the fridge. \nBut washing produce just before you use it is important to remove dirt and pathogenic bugs.\nDon\u2019t use vinegar in your washing water despite what you see on social media. Studies indicate vinegar has no effect on lowering microbial loads on fresh produce.\nSimilarly, don\u2019t use baking soda. Even though there\u2019s some evidence baking soda can remove pesticide residues from the surface of some produce, it\u2019s not advisable at home. Just use plain tap water.\n\nLocation, location, location\nThe main thing you need is the correct type of packaging and the correct location \u2013 you want to manage moisture loss, decay and ripening.\nThe three main storage options are on the counter, in the fridge, or in a \u201ccool, dry and dark place\u201d, such as the pantry. Here are some common examples of produce and where best to put them.\nBananas, onion, garlic, potatoes, sweet potato and whole pumpkin will do better in a dark pantry or cupboard. Don\u2019t store potatoes and onions together: onions produce a gas called ethylene that makes potatoes spoil quicker, while the high moisture in potatoes spoils onions.\nIn fact, don\u2019t store fruits such as apples, pears, avocado and bananas together, because these fruits release ethylene gas as they ripen, making nearby fruits ripen (and potentially spoil) much faster. That is, unless you do want to ripen your fruits fast.\nAll leafy greens, carrots, cucumbers, cauliflower and broccoli will do best in the low-humidity drawer (crisper) in the fridge. You can put them in perforated plastic bags to retain moisture but maintain air flow. But don\u2019t put them in completely sealed bags because this can slow down ripening while trapping carbon dioxide, leading to decay and bad smells.\nSome fruits will also do best in the fridge. For example, apples and citrus fruits such as oranges can keep fresh longer in the fridge (crisper drawer), although they can stay at room temperature for short periods. However, don\u2019t store watermelon in the fridge for too long, as it will lose its flavour and deep red colour if kept refrigerated for longer than three days. \nMost herbs and some leafy vegetables \u2013 like celery, spring onions and asparagus \u2013 can be kept with stems in water to keep them crisp. Keep them in a well-ventilated area and away from direct sunlight, so they don\u2019t get too warm and wilt.\n\nFight food waste and experiment\nDon\u2019t buy too much. Whenever possible, buy only small amounts so that you don\u2019t need to worry about keeping them fresh. Never buy bruised, wounded or damaged produce if you plan to keep it around for more than a day.\n\u201cProcess\u201d your veggies for storage. If you do buy a large quantity \u2013 maybe a bulk option was on sale \u2013 consider turning the produce into something you can keep for longer. For example, banana puree made from really ripe bananas can be stored for up to 14 days at 4\u00b0C. You can use freezing, blanching, fermentation and canning for most vegetables.\nConsider vacuum sealing. Vacuum packaging of vegetables and berries can keep them fresh longer, as well. For example, vacuum-sealed beans can keep up to 16 months in the fridge, but will last only about four weeks in the fridge unsealed.\nKeep track. Arrange your fridge so you can see the produce easily and use it all before it loses freshness.\nExperiment with storage hacks. Social media is full of tips and hacks on how best to store produce. Turn your kitchen into a lab and try out any tips you\u2019re curious about \u2013 they might just work. You can even use these experiments as a way to teach your kids about the importance of reducing food waste. \nGrow some of your own. This isn\u2019t feasible for all of us, but you can always try having some herbs in pots so you don\u2019t need to worry about keeping them fresh or using up a giant bunch of mint all at once. Growing your own microgreens could be handy, too.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Fruit, Food production, Vegetables, Kitchen science, Herbs, Produce","role":"assistant"}]}

While in season three most eyes have centred on Penelope Featherington\u2019s (Nicola Coughlan) glow-up and transformation \u2013 a plot line that effectively argues for the power of clothing \u2013 another character\u2019s unusual accessory has caught the attention of the period drama\u2019s fans.\nThough anything is possible in the fantasy-Regency world of Bridgerton and the question of the show\u2019s historical accuracy is by now a moot point, this season has stumbled upon a happy case of accidental accuracy.\nAs Eloise (Claudia Jessie) and Cressida (Jessica Madsen) promenade in the park in the first episode, Eloise\u2019s forearms are encased in a fuzzy, lilac muff. The unusual decision to have Eloise wear a muff in high summer was made to conceal Jessie\u2019s broken wrist. However, this sartorial twist of fate is actually true to one of the 18th century\u2019s lesser-known accessories \u2013 the silk muff.\n\nMuffs, cylindrical accessories worn around the hands and forearms, were made of three materials during the 18th century: fur, feathers and silk. \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst worn in the 16th century, fur muffs were the most luxurious. Made of fox, lynx or even bear cub, fur muffs could be stuffed with eider down, providing warmth, and were primarily sold from the beginning of October through February. Milliners and furriers (the makers of fur muffs) advertised new muffs in newspapers, as well as cleaning and alteration services to help the ladies of the ton get their muffs ready for the London winter season.\nFeather muffs were also popular and worn throughout the year. After the seven years\u2019 war (1756\u20131763), for example, newspapers in the spring and summer of 1762 were rife with advertisements and editorials for feather muffs. Their popularity was a byproduct of the French losing access to the north American fur trade to the British. However, the most versatile muffs for all seasons were those constructed of silk.\n\nWorn since the 17th century, silk muffs were embellished with embroidery, spangles (aka sequins), or satin prints (printed pictures on silk). Though some are fur-trimmed and heavily insulated, many are only made using a thin layer of wool batting (a natural fibre wadding). This made them a lighter option that could be worn throughout the changeable temperatures of British spring and summertime.\nSilk muffs were often made at home and offered women a blank canvas for sartorial self-expression. They were commonly embroidered using printed patterns from periodicals such as The Lady\u2019s Magazine, or from patterns purchased from town.\nEmbroidering a muff demonstrated the maker\u2019s skill and experience. It also provided a focus of commonality and connection between cousins, siblings and friends. \nFor example, the English paper-flower artist  Mary Delany frequently instructed her sister on her embroidery work.  Delany\u2019s great niece, Frances Mabel Sparrow, also sought the advice of her older cousin Henrietta Pennington, whom she perceived as a \u201cgreat Workwoman\u201d. \nIn her letters, Sparrow sought Pennington\u2019s advice and asked her to send patterns in the latest fashion from London to Sparrow\u2019s home, 120 miles north of the capital. Pennington\u2019s home in Kensington positioned her within reach of the ton (high society). In her cousin\u2019s eyes, this made her an excellent arbiter of fashionable news and taste.\n\nIn addition to the practical networks fostered around embroidery, the practice also formed and reinforced bonds of kinship. In Delany\u2019s correspondence with her sister Anne, she describes one muff that she made as \u201can emblem of you and me, and so I must cherish it\u201d. This shows the sentimental attachment sewing and making could imbue into an accessory.\nLikewise, the choice of thread, stitch, shading, colour and pattern all reveal the personality and ability of a muff\u2019s maker. Bridgerton\u2019s first episode features a discussion of embroidery stitches between young women that Eloise finds extremely boring. It\u2019s depicted as a trivially feminine waste of time. But in reality the practice was one of female empowerment, selfhood and self-expression.\nWith the addition of satin prints in the 1780s, the silk muff literally became a portable canvas. It not only showcased women\u2019s artistic skill with the needle, but also displayed the work of female visual artists, like Angelica Kauffman.  Satin prints often portrayed allegories of virtues, like felicity, innocence, or sincerity.  These printed images, originally painted by Kauffman and printed onto silk, gave women another means of self-fashioning, as well as patronising and promoting women artists. \nSilk muffs were a year-round accessory that bonded women in friendship and gave them a platform for their artistic skills and creativity. The humble muff, in the guise of a simple accessory, was a small, but powerful form of female agency.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"History, Fashion, Fashion history, Bridgerton, Regency era, Regency, Give me perspective, Regency history","role":"assistant"}]}

Michael Tyler, the Biden-Harris campaign communications director, said that the verdict illustrated that \u201cin New York today, we saw that no one is above the law\u201d.\nFormer president Trump was found guilty of all thirty-four charges relating to falsifying business records to conceal a hush-money payment made to former porn star Stormy Daniels. He is the first former president to be found guilty of criminal charges.\nSky News\u2019 US correspondent, James Matthews, wrote that these \u201cthese might be the most significant verdicts ever delivered by an American jury\u201d because of the status of the defendant and possible impact on November\u2019s election.\nTrump emerged from the court and denounced the whole procedure: \u201cthis was a rigged, disgraceful trial\u201d, he said, adding that: \u201cThe real verdict is going to be November 5th by the people.\u201d\nIt\u2019s unclear, as yet, whether the court case has affected Trump\u2019s chances of reelection in November, but there are some signs his base have doubled down after Trump\u2019s campaign donation page crashed once the verdict was announced. \nVoters\u2019 response\nSince the trial started in April, Trump\u2019s lead in the polls over the incumbent president, Joe Biden, has stretched from 0.7% to 1.7%, according to leading US poll analysts FiveThirtyEight.\nAmong Republican voters, according to a YouGov poll this week, Trump received a favourable rating of 41%, while 85% of registered Republican voters intend to vote for Trump in November\u2019s presidential election. This is a slight fall on the 89% of Republican voters that said they would vote for Trump in a YouGov poll at the start of the trial.\nWhile this might not be enough to cost Trump the election, the number of independent voters who said they intended to vote for Trump fell from 42% to 37% during the same period. Only time will tell whether the guilty verdict will have a further impact on Trump\u2019s support.\nWhat is perplexing is not that Trump has been found guilty of the charges but that he continues to attract support in the polls. But most of his supporters believe he has been the subject of a political witch hunt.\nAfter yesterday\u2019s result, Republican congresswoman Mary Miller said \u201cThe leftists are trying to tear America apart by erasing our borders, bankrupting us, and ending our impartial system of justice. The American people see right through these rigged political show trials against President Trump.\u201d\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, a Republican, reacted to the news by saying that the charges brought against Trump were part of \u201ca purely political exercise, not a legal one\u201d.\n\nQuestions remain as to how the international community will react if Trump is reelected as president. However, these allegations are not new and the Trump presidency managed to survive two impeachments as well as an investigation into alleged ties to Russia, of which he was cleared. Although he was impeached by a Democrat-controlled House, the Senate split along party lines and failed to find him guilty on both occasions. \nEuropean leaders are likely to be more focused on any action Trump takes concerning the war in Ukraine and the US continued commitment to Nato.\nWhat happens next\nTrump faces additional charges to those he was convicted of yesterday. All remaining cases carry the potential of substantial jail time. Whether these will come to court before the election is still uncertain.\nThe Trump legal team have sought a decision from the supreme court as to whether a president can be charged for criminal acts conducted during their presidency. Trump\u2019s lawyers have argued before the supreme court that presidents should not be legally restricted from performing their constitutional duties, and that retrospective legal cases brought against presidents, such as that surrounding the 2020 election results, did just that.\nSurprisingly, the majority of Republican voters polled in April by YouGov did not agree that presidents should be exempt from charges for illegal actions taken during their term of office.\nTrump will learn his fate of yesterday\u2019s verdict when he is sentenced by Justice Juan Merchan on July 11 in the New York court, just days before the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\nTrump\u2019s potential sentence is unclear. It could potentially be anything as lenient as a verbal warning to a four-year prison sentence. It is likely that Trump will appeal the sentence in a process that will take the final result past the next election.\nThere is no possibility that Trump can pardon himself, if he is reelected as president in November\u2019s election, because the case was a state case and not tried under federal law. \nTrump will not accept any form of guilty verdict. Throughout his trial he has maintained that he innocent of all charges. In an email to his supporters yesterday, Trump still declared that \u201cwe did nothing wrong\u201d. But the record will show that former president is a convicted felon. What impact this will have on the election and the US\u2019s international reputation will play out over the coming months.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Democracy, NATO, Justice, US justice, Donald Trump, US democracy, US election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

In England the type of phonics teaching is best described as \u201cnarrow synthetic phonics\u201d. \nThis is because England\u2019s curriculum policies and guidance have restricted phonics lessons to an overwhelming emphasis on phonemes and letters at the expense of other aspects of reading, and writing, that are not to be covered in phonics lessons. Phonics is taught using special \u201cdecodable books\u201d, rather than real books. \nAspects such as comprehension, engaging with real books, and writing activities, are all to be taught in different lessons. Yet my research and other studies have found that a more effective way of teaching reading would see phonics and decoding taught with these other main elements, in lessons that should focus on reading and writing at the same time. \n\n\n\n\n\nOne consequence of England\u2019s synthetic phonics is that children are likely to be less motivated to read, because synthetic phonics lessons are not focused on motivation and real purposes for reading.\nModels of reading\nThe way reading is taught in England stems from the interpretation of an influential theory known as \u201cThe Simple View of Reading\u201d. This proposed that reading comprises two elements: decoding and comprehension. In England, this has led to the separation of the teaching of decoding from other parts of the curriculum subject of English. \nIn spite of some positive aspects, the main limitation of the Simple View of Reading \u2013 and some other, similar models for learning to read \u2013 is that the original evidence base was research done with children who struggle with reading, rather than research done with more typical readers. \nWhat\u2019s more, the models do not include various elements that are important for effective teaching because they are more focused on a limited range of elements of children\u2019s learning. For example, the different languages and dialects that children may speak are not accounted for.\nMy new research with colleague Charlotte Hacking proposes a new model of reading, which we call the \u201cDouble Helix\u201d. \n\nThe starting points for teaching inspired by our Double Helix model are children, their languages, their experiences in homes and communities, and the texts that they have encountered. Lessons focus first and foremost on motivating children through use of real books \u2013 standard books written for children rather than texts specially produced for phonics schemes. \nThe lessons integrate the teaching of reading and writing. All lessons are driven by the need to motivate children and to ensure that the purposes of reading and writing, to comprehend and compose texts, are first and foremost. \nPhonemes and letters are taught, but this teaching is integrated with other vital components of reading. For example, lessons should always use whole texts \u2013 books with stories rather than decodable books \u2013 to stimulate children\u2019s interest. A focus on a particular phoneme to be taught is done by selecting a word and sentence in the text then identifying how the letters in the word represent the phoneme. A range of other discussions and activities are also part of this phonics teaching. \nDuring a lesson using this approach, children would be asked to comment on all kinds of questions about the pictures and the story, not just questions about phonemes and letters. They would do writing in the lesson. Phonics teaching would be part of the new approach to teaching, but balanced with all the other elements, so that reading and writing made sense.\nThere is an international trend towards an increasing use of synthetic phonics, seen in Australia, provinces of Canada and the USA. In some countries this trend has been influenced by the narrow approach to synthetic phonics in England that intensified from 2010 onwards. \nBut as an expert in reading education, I think that this trend is not backed up by a balanced and rigorous appraisal of the evidence of what works in the teaching of reading and writing. There are other, better ways than England\u2019s focus on synthetic phonics.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Phonics, Reading, Primary school, Learning to read, UK Schools, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

In a country of 200 million people, there are fewer than 150 psychiatrists, and less than 10% of mentally ill Nigerians have access to the care they need. This treatment gap is a result of shortages of mental health professionals and neuropsychiatric hospitals.     \nNigeria has not actively pursued installing hotlines to support people in need of mental health support. The idea is relatively new in developing countries, including Nigeria. Mental health illnesses are largely left untreated, or treatment is sought from alternative health providers.\nIn 2017, the Lagos University Teaching Hospital started an initiative to prevent suicide through research, crisis intervention, health education and early treatment of depression and drug abuse. The Nigerian based Suicide Research and Prevention Initiative set up a hotline system in Nigeria to respond to those in need of mental health services. The initiative now has a presence in 35 of 36 states, including Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory, and branches in 51 health institutions in the country.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe initiative trained counsellors to receive calls, handle mental health cases, and refer complicated ones to mental health professionals. They also provide follow-up to those counselled, ensuring their needs are addressed.  \nWe conducted research into the use of the hotline, analysing  data collected between March 2022 and September 2023. We focused on this time frame because it was at this point that the hotline was upgraded to a toll-free system, with a dashboard for extensive call monitoring. \nThe findings show that the majority of calls received were from the south-west geopolitical zone. There was a notable gender disparity in calls, with more male callers from the southern region and more female callers from the northern region. There were more callers from Christians and those who were unemployed. \nMost of the calls (71.41%) were focused on seeking mental health services. We concluded from this that there was a substantial demand for and use of the hotline. The focused nature of the calls, including the diverse demographics, suggested in addition that the hotline was effectively providing crucial mental health services to a broad and diverse population across Nigeria. \nThe callers\nThe focus of our research was to examine the efficacy of the hotline service, who used it and what they used it for. \nThe hotline number was advertised on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn after it was upgraded to a toll-free number. Radio broadcasting was used to tell the public about the phone numbers to call if they required mental health services. \nThe Suicide Research and Prevention Initiative team also consulted with community stakeholders to gain their support for the project.\nThe hotline was operational for 24 hours a day. Calls could be made in Nigeria\u2019s three major languages  \u2013 Yoruba, Igbo and Hausa \u2013 as well as English and Pidgin.\nDuring the period in which we collected data, 717 calls were received. Of these, 512 (71%) were made with the caller intending to receive mental health services. \nThe main categories of callers were as follows:\n\n78% were from the southern states of Nigeria\n56% of the calls were from men\nabout half of the callers (51%) were between the ages of 18 and 27 years, across all the geopolitical zones\nunmarried callers accounted for about 72.9%\nmost callers were unemployed \nover 60% of those who called in were in crisis \u2013 they spoke about severe cases of anxiety, suicidal ideation and attempts, and violent behaviour. \n\nWay forward\nThe use of emergency hotlines to provide mental health services is relatively new in Nigeria. This is unlike the United States, where they have been used for decades. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why Africa needs to invest in mental health\n\n\n\n\nOur research shows that people are open to receiving mental health services outside the formal health facilities. This is a huge plus considering the limited number of mental health facilities and health professionals serving the huge population in need of care. However, we call for studies to evaluate the cost of providing mental health services through hotlines. \nThis study also highlights the need for increased advocacy efforts to encourage people to use the free emergency hotline services.

Whoever can master this rapidly changing technology will have an unprecedented level of economic control, and will govern new employment on a vast scale. According to many economists, we are currently in the midst of the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d.  \nIn this power struggle, the leading powers are the USA, the Asia-Pacific region (especially China) and the European Union (EU). However, each is following a different model for developing this technology.\nChina: the highest number of STEM graduates in the world\nChina is the country making the most investment in AI, with expected investments of over $38 billion by 2027, almost 9% of the world\u2019s total. In China, investment is primarily driven by the state, though there are also many private technological platforms in the sector. \nIts population is very open to technology, and this grants the state access to a huge field of experimentation: over 700 million internet users. Many US platforms are barred from the Chinese market, and the country boasts a much higher number of STEM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) graduates than other countries: almost 3.6 million in 2020, followed by India with 2.6 million, and the United States with 820,000.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrailing far behind, the only EU countries that feature in the top 10 countries by number of STEM graduates are France and Germany, with 220,000 and 216,000 respectively.\nThe power struggle between China and the US\nIn August 2023, the Chinese government issued a formal statement of \u201cconcern\u201d in response to a US government order prohibiting investment in Chinese semiconductors and microelectronics, quantum technology and AI. \nThe US claims the limits were put in place are because these sectors play a key role in developing advanced military, intelligence, surveillance and computing capabilities. While the private sector is the driving force behind the current technological revolution in the US, a significant amount of research funding is provided by Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the US Department of Defense agency responsible for developing new military technologies.\n\nMicrosoft and France\u2019s GDP\nThe largest companies in the AI sector are US-based. They have a virtual monopoly on the current development of the technology, and are global leaders in terms of stock market value. \nThese macro-companies are beginning to have influence and impacts at state level. Microsoft has recently returned to the top of the global stock market after increasing its stock value by more than 50% in 12 months, becoming the first company to surpass the $3 trillion valuation, equivalent to the GDP of France.\nAs of 13 February 2024, Saudi Arabian oil giant Aramco is the only non-technology company in the top seven largest companies in the world. The rest of the global pie belongs to, in order of size, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, Amazon and Meta. \nThe hegemony of these large companies means they can attract talent, and they are expanding into other territories, especially European countries. However, last year\u2019s HAI Artificial Intelligence Index Report shows a striking decline in their attractiveness: a noticeable drop in hiring international students in both the US and Canada, especially at master\u2019s level.\nDecisions are in the hands of private companies\nThese big tech companies wield indisputable amounts power, and not just on an economic level. They have access to massive amounts of data (protecting privacy and limiting data leakage with legislation is increasingly complex), global political influence (not just in the US) and an unbeatable public image that allows them to lead innovation. \nThese businesses dictate the direction of research and innovation worldwide, and they dominate cutting edge AI research, as well as the basic technology that is crucial in strengthening a country\u2019s technological independence and sovereignty. Only a few years ago, this \u201cfrontier\u201d research was led by academia, and it is here that Europe still has a relevant role to play.   \nEurope\u2019s research institutions outweigh China\nIn Europe the situation is mixed, with strong state support in some member states, mainly France and Germany, and a significant number of startups, especially in the UK. However, none of the world\u2019s top technology companies are European, and the continent also lacks the large entrepreneurial platforms of the US and China. \nIn Europe there is a relative aversion to risk. Another significant factor is talent drain, as many European graduates move away for better opportunities. But Europe does have one major advantage, as it is home to a significant number of top 100 research insitutions \u2013 just as many as the US, and more than China.\nThis is mirrored in the ranking of the most prestigious universities in AI research, where the US leads and Europe follows closely behind, with only one Chinese institution in the top ten. \nWho will pay to develop GPT-4?\nIn 2023, 51 notable AI models were developed by private industry, compared to just 15 by academia. However, models developed in collaboration between the two sectors hit a record high, with 21 industry-academia collaborations recorded last year. \nOne relevant factor here is the substantial increase in the economic cost of developing these models, which consume large amounts of both computing and energy resources. The training costs of Open AI\u2019s state-of-the-art GPT-4 and Google\u2019s Gemini Ultra models were estimated at $78 million and $191 million respectively. Figures like these are beyond the reach of most academic research. \nEurope is taking the ethical route\nOn 13 March 2024, the EU approved the AI Act, the first regulation in the Western world on artificial intelligence. The law is designed to be ethical, aiming to serve the people rather than big business. Other countries such as China and the US are moving forward with their own regulation, but with very different perspectives. While not its intended purpose, some claim the AI act will stifle innovation in the sector.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      EU approves draft law to regulate AI \u2013 here's how it will work\n\n\n\n\nAI is bringing with it a new wave of innovation, not only promoting new forms of technological entrepreneurship, but also new values such as sustainable computing, privacy by design in algorithms and technological sovereignty, all of which are present in the new EU regulations. \nEurope is pushing for the use of AI in climate action and building sustainability, and the development of AI with better data and greener algorithms to make it sustainable. Ethical courage could well be the path that to a strong EU position in the unstoppable technological revolution of the 21st century.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), United States, China, European Union (EU), Technology, The Conversation Europe","role":"assistant"}]}

The move will value the company at A$2.2 billion.\nAn IPO \u2013 sometimes also called a company float \u2013 signifies the first time that a privately owned company lists its shares on a public stock exchange.\nBut it\u2019s an expensive process, which also allows public investors to \u201clook at the books\u201d and scrutinise a company\u2019s financial performance in detail. \nSo how do IPOs work, and why do companies do them? \nMost companies are private, but all technically have shares\nAll companies technically have \u201cshares\u201d. These simply represent a stake of ownership in a company and its profits. A company might have one shareholder with a single 100% share, or thousands of them, all holding different percentages of the company. \nThe vast majority of companies are privately held, meaning their shares can\u2019t be traded without private negotiations. When a company goes public, it means that anyone can now easily trade shares in it at their market price by placing an order on a stock exchange.\n\nAt a high level, the price of a share represents the relevant fraction of all future cash flows a company is expected to generate, expressed in terms of their value today (what we call a present value). We can\u2019t know the future, so the value of a share changes as these expectations change. \nWhile an IPO represents the first time a company\u2019s shares become available for trading by the public, the majority of those shares typically already exist. \nFor example, Guzman y Gomez\u2019s IPO prospectus (a heavily detailed report that to-be-listed companies are required to publish) says the company will have about 101.3 million shares on issue after the IPO. But this is only about 10% more than already currently exist. \nWhy do it?\nBeing a public company isn\u2019t easy \u2013 it attracts the full scrutiny of a market of public investors that\u2019s often criticised as being short-sighted and overly sensitive to short-term fluctuations in performance. So why float at all? \nAsking chief financial officers who\u2019ve been through the process typically reveals some common themes. \nNear the top of the list, an IPO helps a company establish an accurate market price for itself. \n\nAn unlisted company might have a pretty good idea as to what its assets are worth. But it\u2019s not until it falls under the fickle lens of market scrutiny that it receives a more objective \u2013 and sometimes alarming \u2013 assessment of its true value. \nOne big benefit of knowing what a company is worth, and issuing new shares based on that valuation, is that its original owners can sell some of their shares through the offering.\nThis has twin benefits. It enables them to convert previously hard-to-sell company shares into cash, and provides the opportunity to diversify their personal investment portfolios.\nBut being listed also provides a firm with superior access to new sources of cash. It gets to enjoy some of these benefits immediately by fundraising in the IPO \u2013 selling shares to new investors. But the more rigorous disclosure regime under which listed companies have to operate also means the firm will likely benefit from better access to debt (such as corporate bonds) and equity (shares) markets in the future. \nLooking a little more aggressively down the corporate track, a listed company might eventually want to acquire other firms. Being listed means a firm can use its publicly traded shares instead of cash to make an offer for another company, which is called a \u201cscrip bid\u201d.\nMany of these common benefits are relevant to the case of Guzman y Gomez\u2019s IPO, which is expected to raise $242.5 million by issuing 11.1 million shares. \nAbout $42.5 million of these funds will go to existing shareholders cashing out their investment. The remaining $200 million raised is expected to be divided between covering the costs of the IPO ($17.4 million) and funding future expansion of the restaurant network in Australia and possibly internationally. \n\nThe process isn\u2019t cheap or easy\nYou can see that IPOs aren\u2019t cheap transactions, with almost 9% of the $200 million raised being paid to various managers and advisers to the float. \nSo what does the firm get in return for their money? Two joint lead managers have been engaged on the Guzman y Gomez float \u2013 investment banks Barrenjoey Markets and Morgan Stanley. \nTo date, these firms will have delivered a lot of hands-on practical advice about structuring the deal \u2013 such as how to determine the number of shares available for sale to institutions, broker firms, employees and franchisees. \nBut crucially, they also advise on the offer price for those shares. Remember, Guzman y Gomez is in the Mexican food business, not the IPO business, so it is heavily reliant on its investment banking team to help set an appropriate price. \nSet it too high and the shares may remain unsold. Too low, and the company will have \u201cleft money on the table\u201d by passing up the opportunity to sell shares at their full value.\nFortunately, the leadership of Guzman y Gomez can get some sleep in the run-up to the listing. The joint managing investment banks have agreed, for a fee, to underwrite the deal, which means that they will step in and buy shares at a set price if any offered don\u2019t sell. \nBut that\u2019s not to say it\u2019s all stress free. While the subscription price of the new shares has been set \u2013 and guaranteed \u2013 at $22 per share, this does not necessarily mean the share will continue to trade at $22 after it\u2019s listed.\nIn Australia\u2019s biggest IPO last year, chemical distributor Redox issued shares at $2.55, valuing it at $1.3 billion. But by the end of the first day, prices had fallen by about 5%.\nThat\u2019s the great thing about public markets. You\u2019ll get transparent objective feedback from day one, whether you like it or not!\n","role":"user"},{"content":"share market, ASX, Growth, Stocks, public company, Business, hospitality industry, Stock exchange, Business basics, Business basics series","role":"assistant"}]}

It\u2019s not the first time such initiatives have been necessary, nor the first time that media and politicians have expressed astonishment that a renowned musician \u201cdied in poverty\u201d.\nMusicians\u2019 dire financial circumstances are sometimes wrongly blamed on irresponsible spending; a musicians\u2019 pension plan is often proposed as a solution. But until very recently, no data existed about what musicians in South Africa really earn, what costs they carry, and the tough trade-offs between professional and household costs they often need to make in order to survive.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Music streaming in South Africa \u2013 new survey reveals musicians get a raw deal\n\n\n\n\nAs a music researcher who has written frequently on the economics of music work, I welcomed the opportunity to conduct long-term research with a team at IKS Cultural Consulting into a relief fund supporting SA jazz musicians during the COVID-19 period. That work has now given us concrete information to better understand the picture. Surprisingly, far fewer research projects anywhere in the world have looked at individual musicians than at how \u201cthe industry\u201d (major music businesses) fares. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we found confirms what has been understood anecdotally for a long time. Even \u201cstar\u201d musicians are not nearly as well paid as the public believes. In fact, their working costs are sometimes high enough to drive them away from music as a profession. \nAnd mining the fund\u2019s administrative data affirmed how valuable such data is for far more than accounting. It can inform policy too.\nThe research\nThe main purpose of the study was to evaluate the impact of the Swiss Jazz Income Relief Fund, administered by Pro Helvetia Johannesburg during the pandemic. Pro Helvetia took on the relief fund as a special project \u2013 with finance from a Swiss donor \u2013 in the context of its longstanding commitment to sustaining exchange and collaboration in the jazz field between Switzerland and South Africa. The fund paid regular monthly disbursements based on self-reported household income shortfall for 6- or 12-month periods between July 2020 and October 2021.\nIdentifying details of the fund\u2019s 700-plus recipients were removed before we analysed the income and spending data they submitted. A voluntary anonymous survey followed in 2022, which 311 of those completed. More extended retrospective reflections followed late in 2023 with seven on-the-record interviews.\nMusicians\u2019 experience of the fund itself was overwhelmingly positive. And there are significant potential learnings for grant-makers and policy-makers about what a difference it can make when accessible processes are tailored to the patterns of musicians\u2019 earning and spending. \n\nWhen we asked recipients to say how the funding helped, \u201cSaved me\u201d and \u201cI\/we survived\u201d were the words that came back most often. Diverse, innovative ways of using the support to sustain and grow careers were also reported. We heard many heartening stories of community initiatives: food parcels; opening homes to serve as rehearsal spaces; educating the young.\nAlthough our research population was jazz musicians, and we don\u2019t claim their situation is identical to that of musicians making other kinds of music, we\u2019re confident their circumstances apply far more widely. More than 90% of them, like their counterparts worldwide, work in other genres too. Studies across multiple genres from elsewhere concur about the patterns of earnings and working costs we found.\nThe findings\nOur research was skewed towards experienced musicians, some at the height of their careers. They averaged earnings similar to the South African average wage: not what a \u201cstar\u201d might earn, but what a formally employed mid-level South African motor mechanic or payroll clerk does \u2013 around R26,000 (US$1,392) a month. \nHowever, musicians have no formal employment contracts or packages, or a guaranteed monthly wage. Work is irregular and project-based, with no regulated 35-hour week or any tax concession for the tools of their trade \u2013 in fact many instruments are taxed as \u201cluxuries\u201d. \nMusicians earn from multiple \u201cincome streams\u201d: they\u2019re paid from many sources. However, many other COVID-19 relief grants demanded formal proofs of only one consistent wage. Said vocalist and music educator Zodwa Mabena:\n\nYou\u2019re running around looking for company numbers, things like that \u2026 things most of us don\u2019t have.\n\nMusicians carry significant opportunity costs in terms of the long and usually unpaid rehearsal and practice hours they have to put in to stay skilled. During that time, they cannot do other work. They carry significant working costs: instrument and equipment purchase and upkeep; studio and venue hire; and \u2013 most significantly for many \u2013 transport. Some reported turning down engagements because travel costs would be higher than the fee offered.\nLasting impact of COVID\nWorldwide, musicians have been experiencing a \u201ccost of working crisis\u201d since the pandemic. So are South Africans. \nThere was a 31% drop-off in the number of people who reported earning their main income from music between 2019 and 2021. And 45% of our respondents expressed pessimism about their future in music. All costs have risen. Bassist Shane Cooper told us:\n\nWe have a band member living in another city \u2026 We used to be able to make it work \u2026 (but now) it\u2019s just not financially viable. We don\u2019t play.\n\nStudios and other service providers also have to compensate for the devastating losses incurred during the pandemic. Because some venues have closed and events ceased, work is scarcer, and the fees offered are static or have even dropped.\nMeanwhile, musicians have their own COVID-period debts to repay. Some have to repurchase instruments and equipment they were forced to sell. Many lost old colleagues to COVID, and report now having to forge new working relationships with younger freelance players who may expect higher fees. Professional development costs, such as upgrading equipment or making better recordings and promotional videos, fall most heavily on younger, less established musicians.\nAll this happens in a context where musicians constantly face a trade-off dilemma between spending on sustaining or growing their music and putting food on the table, paying school fees and everything else that must be budgeted for.\nSo, as we found, it\u2019s not surprising that musicians spend much less on retirement planning than other earners, and proportionately more on dependants, communication and insurance (instrument insurance costs are high).  \nWhat needs to happen\nBut a national artists\u2019 pension scheme might not offer an answer. Musicians might not be able to contribute regularly, because of intermittent work. Should they make the pension scheme payment \u2013 or use that money to travel to a gig that might be the only work in sight that month?\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Nearly half of South Africa\u2019s live music workers may quit the industry for good\n\n\n\n\nOur findings suggest that policy and grant-making need to be rooted far more deeply in understanding the real circumstances of musicians\u2019 working lives. Correcting opaque bureaucratic processes, implementing an income streams perspective that understands musicians may have multiple sources of earnings, and giving consideration to musicians\u2019 costs of working, for example, might better help to sustain this important creative industry.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Pensions, Music industry, Cultural economy, Musicians, South African culture, Music in Africa, COVID-19, Arts industry, South Africa cultural economy, African musicians, South African musicians, post-COVID","role":"assistant"}]}

Two truisms spring to mind:\n1. Don\u2019t let the tax tail wag the dog\nMany tax hacks suggest you spend considerable money on purchases up front to claim tax deductions. But a tax deduction isn\u2019t actually worth the value amount of your spend. \nFor example: let\u2019s say you\u2019re on a taxable income of A$60,000 per year, which puts you roughly in the 50th percentile of income earners and means your marginal tax rate is 32.5 cents. \nYou might spend $1,000 on a purchase in the hope of getting a sweet $1,000 tax deduction. However, you\u2019re going to be $675 out of pocket. This is because that $1,000 deduction is only worth $325 (because tax is calculated on your taxable income, which is assessable income less allowable deductions).\nIt will be worth even less next year because of the introduction of the revised Stage 3 tax cuts and that\u2019s a good thing because you\u2019ll be paying less tax overall.\n2. If it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is\nEven if you use a registered tax agent (and it\u2019s important to check they are registered by checking the Tax Practitioners\u2019 Board), it\u2019s a common pitfall to think any aggressive deductions they might suggest are their responsibility if the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) comes knocking. That\u2019s not the case.\nTaxpayers are responsible for errors in returns made by their tax agents, so the ATO will hold you responsible.\nIndeed, the ATO has announced it will be taking a close look at three common errors being made by taxpayers:\n\nincorrectly claiming work-related expenses\ninflating claims for rental properties\nfailing to include all income when lodging.\n\nIt might be tempting to think you\u2019ve got away with over claiming deductions or under reporting income but the ATO has sophisticated systems to analyse your data) and track your claims.\nYou\u2019ll need to substantiate your claims, so keep records. If the tax office finds mistakes, you could face financial penalties, even jail time.\nTwo months ago, a woman was sentenced to two years and six months jail and ordered to repay $39,600 after she lodged three fraudulent Business Activity Statements and received a GST refund to which she wasn\u2019t entitled.  While under investigation, she then sent eight false statements to the ATO and tried to claim more money. \nThis is one on many individuals named on the ATO\u2019s website highlighting the results of regular crackdowns.\nSo, should I use a tax agent?\nThere are nearly 20.5 million active tax file numbers registered to individuals in Australia and last tax year the ATO received 13.7 million individual tax return lodgements. This was a 3% increase on the previous year. Of these lodgements more than 5.6 million were lodged by self-preparers and more than 8 million were lodged by tax agents.\n\nIt makes sense most Australians use agents to prepare and lodge their tax returns. It\u2019s easier, less stressful, gives you confidence the job is being done right and saves time.\nHaving said that, it does come at a price (see above on the value of deductions), and previous research which finds that every extra dollar spent on a tax agent only yields an estimated tax savings of 20 cents), and if you have simple tax affairs then it\u2019s relatively easy and quick to do it yourself.\nHow do I prepare my tax return?\nGenerally, everyone should be lodging an income tax return each year (or, if you don\u2019t need to lodge a tax return, lodging a non-lodgement advice). The ATO has a \u201cDo I need to lodge a tax return?\u201d tool if you\u2019re unsure.\nIt also has a useful two minute video which steps you through the process for lodging with their online system myTax.\nFor those of us with simple tax affairs, you just need to follow these steps:\n\ngather and prepare all your information regarding income from work, interest, dividends and any other income such as capital gains from crypto assets or sale of shares\nthen gather and prepare all your information on deductions and work expenses to be claimed making sure you have the evidence to back up your claims. This can be in the form receipts, invoices, log books and diary entries\nif you are a self-preparer you can log onto your myGov or the ATO\u2019s app to prepare and lodge your return. If you wait until late-July you\u2019ll have the benefit of the ATO\u2019s pre-filled data, too. This gives you plenty of time to make the October 31 deadline. \n\nThere\u2019s also the option to use the ATO\u2019s free, volunteer-run TaxHelp program (provided you meet the eligibility criteria), your local Tax Clinic (details here), or by seeking help from a registered tax agent. Just make sure you engage them before the October 31 deadline.\nWhere it might get tricky\nBut for others, for example if you have an ABN, it gets a bit more complicated. If you operate your business as a sole trader, you must lodge a tax return, even if your income is below the tax-free threshold.\n\nAnd if you have registered for GST \u2013 which you must do when your business or enterprise has a GST turnover of $75,000 or more, or if you are a taxi driver or Uber driver \u2013 then you will also need to submit quarterly BAS. \nIt gets even more complicated for partnerships, trusts and companies, so it is best to seek the guidance and professional expertise of a registered tax agent, if you aren\u2019t already.\nWhat if I can\u2019t afford a tax agent?\nThis year, many Australians are doing it tough. Indeed, research by the ASIC\u2019s Moneysmart program estimates more than five million Australians are in financial strife.\nMany people will find it hard to prioritise paying a registered tax agent when they cannot afford basic necessities like food. \nIf you\u2019re in this situation, you might find it useful to get in touch with a free financial counsellor via the National Debt Helpline or the Small Business Debt Helpline.\nDon\u2019t procrastinate\nDon\u2019t put off doing your tax. If you\u2019re behind, it might seem daunting to get back on track, especially if you think you\u2019ll have to pay extra tax this year instead of getting a refund. But not lodging your returns will backfire. Like avoiding a trip to the doctor to get a skin check, the longer you wait, the more the problem will grow.\nReaching out to the ATO is the key because they have tools to support you, including payment plans. It also shows the ATO that you are willing to comply. Ultimately, being up to date will save you fines, interest and penalties.\nIf you are one of the 80,000 Australians in serious hardship who need but can\u2019t afford professional help to complete and lodge overdue returns, the government-funded National Tax Clinics Program can help with free tax advice.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Australian Taxation Office, Income tax, Tax deductions, Tax fraud, Record keeping, Tax return, Tax advice, Tax refund","role":"assistant"}]}

The pain was bad and I was limping a lot of the time. My doctor recommended arthroscopic knee surgery to fix it. \nBeing scared of scalpels, I asked whether there were other options. He said I could try physiotherapy, but that it was unlikely to work. I tried the physio and did the recommended exercises diligently, and my knee pain and function returned to almost normal. I even ran my first (and only) marathon a year later.\nPhysio isn\u2019t the only thing that might work as well as arthroscopic knee surgery. In the 1990s, Dr Bruce Moseley found 180 patients who had such severe knee pain that they had trouble getting out of their chairs. They then either received real or sham (placebo) arthroscopy. \nReal arthroscopy involved giving painkillers and inserting a small metal tube (an arthroscope) into the knee to repair damaged cartilage and remove loose bone fragments that cause pain. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe sham (placebo) arthroscopy procedure included painkillers and a small cut on their knees, but there was no arthroscope, no repairing of damaged cartilage and no cleaning out loose fragments of bone. \nPatients receiving the sham procedure thought they were receiving the real one (this is called \u201cblinding\u201d). And the doctors and nurses mimicked the sounds of real surgery. \nBlinding is considered important for preventing patients\u2019 expectations from influencing the results. \nAll the patients were monitored for two years to see how many stairs they could climb before their pain got in the way. The results were clear: the sham procedure was as good for pain and function. Also, because the sham surgery is less invasive, it is less harmful. For example, there is a lower risk of infection.\n\nMoseley\u2019s results have been replicated several times. \nOn this basis, we might expect that the less invasive sham procedure replaced the more invasive \u2013 and more harmful \u2013 real version. Yet over a million arthroscopies are performed in the US each year, costing US$5,000 each (\u00a33,935) or US$5 billion. And about 40,000 are done in the UK each year, costing \u00a31,681 each (\u00a367 million in total).\nA similar story can be told about sham surgery for many other conditions. For example, sham vertebroplasty (sticking a needle into the spine where an injection of cement would normally go) works as well as the real thing (injecting cement to heal a fractured vertebra). \nUnfortunately, the cement glue can leak, possibly causing more fractures. \nMore broadly, a review of 53 placebo-controlled surgery trials found that sham surgery was as good as the real thing in over half of the studies. Sham knee and back surgery works as well as real surgery for pain. Pretending to put brain implants works as well as real implants for reducing migraine attacks. Fake laser surgery works as well as real laser surgery to stop gastrointestinal bleeding. And fake surgery works as well as real surgery for making sphincters function more efficiently.\nThree reasons ethicists (wrongly) reject it\nThere are three main reasons why sham surgeries have not replaced the real versions despite their benefits. First, some ethicists claim that the sham procedure is too risky. But I would argue the sham version is usually less risky than the real procedure, yet it can work just as well.\nSecond, some people believe that sham surgery requires deception (telling people who get the sham surgery that it might be the real thing) to be effective. While Moseley\u2019s patients were blinded, many trials show that sham interventions can be delivered \u201chonestly\u201d (whereby patients are told that the placebo is a placebo) and still work.\nFinally, the name. Sham surgery is not a sham or a placebo. Sham surgery activates the wound-healing cascade. \nAll living organisms are very good at regenerating themselves when they get cut. A planarian flatworm\u2019s head can even grow back if you cut it off. Human heads can\u2019t grow back, but many parts of the human repair themselves spontaneously. Whether a cut is from a thorn or a surgeon\u2019s scalpel, the wound-healing cascade begins. \nIt involves blood clots to stop the bleeding, white blood cells phagocytosing (devouring) harmful bacteria, and creating new tissue and blood vessels to feed the tissue and close up the wound. Finally, scar tissue and skin cover the wound. \nAll this happens to any patient receiving any sham surgery. So the wound healing cascade that started following the sham surgery could change the mechanics of knees, shoulders and backs in ways that reduce pain and improve function (research is required to confirm this). \nAlso, placebo surgery often includes painkillers. With less pain, people feel freer to move around, and the moving around often can reduce pain and improve function.\nA better name for so-called placebo or sham surgery is therefore \u201cminimally invasive surgery.\u201d Patients suffering from conditions where the placebo surgery has performed as well as the more invasive, expensive and risky surgery could be offered the option of minimally invasive surgery. They could be given honest instructions about what the procedure involved.\nGiven that doctors are bound by the Hippocratic oath to help and avoid harm, and that minimally invasive surgery helps as much as more invasive surgery without harming as much, it is arguably an ethical requirement.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Despite Africa accounting for less than 4% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, many of its countries face significant threats from climate change, including increased droughts, floods, heat waves and potential crop failures.\nClimate change costs the continent US$5 billion to US$7 billion yearly, a figure projected to reach US$50 billion by 2030. Estimates suggest its impact could push 50 million Africans below the poverty line, while 100 million are at risk of being displaced. At the same time around 600 million people in Africa still lack access to energy, fundamental for economic development.\nTackling the twin imperatives of sustainable development \u2013 meeting the needs of the present without a negative impact on the future \u2013 and economic growth in Africa is paramount. It was a central theme at the first Africa Climate Summit, held in Nairobi last September. However, these challenges are typically seen as being diametrically opposed. Often, they are discussed in isolation. This conversation needs to change. We must acknowledge that sustainable development and economic growth are interdependent \u2013 one cannot occur without the other.\nBased on my research into the role of multinational firms in the development of emerging markets, over the last decade, what\u2019s missing in the debates are answers to the question facing many commodity-rich African countries: do they use their natural resources for development and damn the environment, or seek an alternative which acknowledges that sustainable development and economic growth are interdependent?\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica is highly dependent on extraction of natural resources for its economy, including oil and gas and minerals such as copper, cobalt, gold and diamonds.\nIn fact, 45 African economies are already reliant on commodity exports, including fossil fuels. Yet they are facing increasing pressure to turn their backs on this potentially lucrative revenue stream.\nRather than the simplistic arguments that all extractive engagement is bad, the question that really needs to be asked is how to extract resources while causing minimal damage to the environment.\nBypassing simplistic answers\nNot unfairly, people across Africa demand the same kind of economic opportunities already enjoyed by those in the global north. But here lies the problem. To achieve this, the most obvious solution for many African countries is to adopt the economic development model employed by the current developed countries. That means exploiting the large and relatively untapped natural resources that lie within their borders. \nAs former Nigerian president Olusegun Obasanjo put it at the Africa Energy Week 2023, \n\nWhere is the justice when you used what (fossil fuels) was available to you, but we (Africans) can\u2019t use it? You want to keep us in the habitual position of underdevelopment. We reject that!\n\nThe reality in many African countries is that using the natural materials found within their borders is crucial if they are to continue their economic development. \nMany have claimed that Africa can become a green industrial hub to exploit its renewable energy resources and lead the charge towards decarbonisation. But to achieve this technological transformation and to construct the necessary batteries, solar panels and electrical vehicles requires raw materials.\nCompanies need to find better ways to extract resources while causing minimal damage to the environment.\nThe good news is that this is already happening. Mining firms like the Bill Gates-backed KoBold Metals are now using artificial intelligence to predict the location of deposits, minimising the negative environmental effects of test drilling. \nFirms are also exploring the potential of keyhole mining technology to reduce the need for open mines, which have a serious environmental impact.\nThe challenge of context\nA green revolution needs money, innovation and technology to succeed. It also needs to address the unique needs of individual countries and even individual people. Put simply, the launch of a green revolution is expensive and context-specific.\nGreen technology has typically been designed, tested and implemented in developed nations.\nSolar energy works if your country has a reliable and extensive energy grid that can store and then effectively distribute the energy generated. It is not so practical when applied to a nation that has just emerged from a period of civil war and has a limited, damaged or non-existent energy network.\nTake the installation of solar streetlights in Nigeria. The idea seems great and uses technology that works elsewhere. Yet it has been ineffective in practice. It\u2019s not an isolated case.\nA 2017 research paper revealed some of the common causes of failure for renewable energy initiatives in sub-Saharan Africa. The study analysed 29 publicly funded projects across ten countries, ranging from electrification of public institutions and solar street lighting to micro-grid rural electrification.\nThe paper found that common factors contributing to failure included political agendas, flaws in the project awarding process, insufficient stakeholder cooperation, issues in project planning and implementation, lack of effective maintenance and challenges related to public acceptance and inclusion. The last two points underline the importance of local context in green projects.\nTime and money\nGrand sustainable solutions like wind farms, public transport networks or geothermal plants also fall down when viewed through a more local lens. In many developing countries energy needs can be as localised and immediate as someone heading into the forest to collect wood so they can cook their evening meal. Mega projects take time that those who need energy now just don\u2019t have.\nThen there is the question of raising the external investment for these projects. The Nairobi Declaration, which was signed at the Africa Climate Summit in September 2023, called for an almost six-fold increase in renewable energy capacity across the continent. Yet, according to a 2022 report by the Climate Policy Initiative, Africa has received only 12% of the finance it needs to cope with climate impacts. This is due in part to concerns over the risk of investing in the continent.\nEngaging the right stakeholders, the right way\nIt is also important that \u201cgreen\u201d development benefits as many local stakeholders as possible. While there is obviously an expectation that governments lead this conversation, companies must share this responsibility.\nI\u2019ve previously written about how companies can communicate better with different stakeholders. It\u2019s also vital that they properly understand their different needs and the contexts in which stakeholders live.  \nThe differences in how people get food, shelter and energy, can be vast even in one country. One plan won\u2019t necessarily work for everyone.\nToo often companies are misguided in their assumptions about what stakeholders want and need to make their lives better.\nVery few people in developing countries are going to buy an eco-friendly cooking stove because it is better for the environment. But they will buy it if it makes their life easier. The only way to understand people\u2019s needs is to bring them into the process from the start. Firms need to design products and develop solutions that are sustainable. But they also must be practical and meet specific needs.\nCreating new paths for sustainability\nAs countries around the world look to continue their economic development they also need to deal with the growing impact of climate change. \nHaving just one model for sustainable economic development is not an option. It\u2019s important to:\n\nconsider regional and local challenges\nlisten to the voices and needs of local stakeholders\naccept that sustainable development means different things for different people.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Africa economic growth","role":"assistant"}]}

Paterson College because the school had ordered the boy to cut his long hair. \n\u201cLike other private schools, we have a uniform policy,\u201d school principal Joanne Sheehy said. \u201cOurs is intended to encourage all our students to be well-presented, respectful and unified.\u201d\nThe story is a familiar one. Disputes over school uniform policies are repeatedly making the media. Frequently, these disputes concern hair. \nThis includes students being barred from class photos for \u201cunnaturally\u201d coloured hair or a teacher cutting a student\u2019s long hair.  Students have also been disciplined for wearing cultural hairstyles such as braids, or turning up to school with styles such as mullets. \n\n\n\n\n\nThese stories are all part of a larger phenomenon I have examined in my new research: school policies on hair often enforce an idea of \u201cgood taste\u201d that favour certain norms around gender, class and race. \n\nMy research\nMy research examines the hair polices of 50 senior high schools in Queensland (for students in Years 11 and 12). \nIt looked at what the policies are and how they are justified by schools. \nThis sample included government and independent schools. The independent or private schools were divided into Catholic and Protestant schools. \nThe schools came from a wide variety of locations, regions and socioeconomic contexts. \nMy findings\nHair policies are often a subset of a broader uniform policy that can cover makeup, jewellery, shoes, clothing and appearances in public areas. \nMost schools had general justifications for their overall uniform policies, rather than specific discussion of their hair component. \nThese general justifications were around occupational health and safety, sun safety, school culture, school image, equality among students (through a uniform appearance) and legislative compliance or community endorsement (such as approval from their P&C association) \nFor example, one private Protestant school said: \n\n[the school] recognises that during teenage years individuality is often desired and expressed through clothing choice. However, the uniform is a vital representation of the school and its ethos, value base and placement as a private school.\n\nWhere schools did talk specifically about hair, they emphasised \u201cstandards\u201d and school image and tone. \nAs one government school said: \n\nUndertaking a conservative hairstyle will ensure compliance with the high standards of dress and appearance in place at [this school] and thereby help to maintain a positive tone in the school community and ensure that our primary focus will be centred on learning.\n\nThe regulations for hair itself typically focused on acceptable length, colour and styling.  \n\n\u2018Appropriate\u2019 lengths\nThere were regulations around hair being too long and too short, and about it being \u201cappropriate\u201d for male and female genders. \nOf the government schools, 15 required long hair to be restrained and one required hair to be no shorter than a number two cut. Few sought to justify this regulation, although six schools did reference health and safety (for example, keeping long hair back during \u201cpractical\u201d subjects or as a general safety measure). None explicitly connected this regulation to gender. \nBy contrast, private schools were heavily gendered. A total of 25 private schools (13 Catholic and 12 Protestant schools) required long hair to be restrained. Fourteen of these schools only applied this regulation to female students. \nThirteen schools (five Catholic and eight Protestant), required male students\u2019 hair to be cut short. Appropriate length was often defined in exacting detail, specifying where hair may reach in relation to the student\u2019s earlobes and eyebrows, the shortest blade permitted to cut hair, and whether tucking hair behind the ears was permissible. More lenient schools simply required hair to be clear of the collar.\nIf the requirement for female students to restrain long hair is cross-referenced with the requirement for male students to have short hair, there were 17 private schools that explicitly linked hair length with gender.\n\n\u2018Natural\u2019 colours\nSchools were particularly concerned with keeping hair colour natural. Sixteen government schools banned \u201cunnatural\u201d hair colours, of which three additionally banned naturally coloured dye and two only permitted naturally coloured dye that \u201caligned\u201d with the student\u2019s hair. \nAs one government school said: \n\nThe hair styles not permitted include, but not limited to [\u2026] unnatural hair colours or awkwardly contrasting colours.\n\nOf the 29 private schools that regulated hair, all banned \u201cunnatural\u201d hair colours, of which four additionally banned naturally coloured dye and four only permitted naturally coloured dye that \u201caligned\u201d with the student\u2019s hair. \nAs one Protestant school said: \n\nStudents are not permitted to dye, bleach or colour their hair to create stark contrasts, a colour or multiple colours away from their natural hair colour. All treatments must be subtle, aligned with the student\u2019s natural hair colour and have the effect of being barely noticeable.\n\nIn \u201cbeing barely noticeable\u201d, a student can appear as part of a cohesive whole, united school community \u2013 a key value across the three school affiliations.\n\u2018Conservative\u2019 styles\nSchools were also concerned to make sure hair was styled in certain ways. It was common to see a stipulation for students to either wear a \u201cconservative\u201d hairstyle or avoid an \u201cextreme\u201d one. \nGovernment schools also listed a total of 24 unacceptable styles, Catholic schools provided 27 banned styles and Protestant schools listed 30. The table below details the most frequently banned styles, with regulations on length and colour for comparison.\nMy research found a noticeable difference between regulations on length and colour versus those on style. Across the three types of schools, 45 schools restrict hair colour, representing 90% of the sample. Similarly, 40 schools, or 80% of the sample, ban unrestrained long hair. \nYet the most frequently banned style, a rat\u2019s tail, was only banned by 14 schools or 28% of the sample. The next most common \u2013 undercut and mohawk \u2013 were only banned by 13 and 12 schools, respectively. Mullets were specifically banned by nine schools. \nSo while there is a general consensus on inappropriate colour and length, there is only minimal consensus on what exact styles are \u201cwrong\u201d for school.\n\n\n\nWhat do these rules really mean?\nThese policies are presented as objective \u201crules\u201d and yet hair styles are imbued with social and cultural meanings. Dreadlocks or braids are common ways to wear hair in African cultures, for example. \nThe sociocultural connotations are further complicated by who has that haircut. For example, an undercut on a male student may be seen as trendy, on a female student it could be interpreted as a signifier of queer identity.\nThen there\u2019s the mullet. While it may be celebrated in national competitions and even seen as fashionable again, it can also signify bogan culture which many schools seem to find undesirable. Elite private schools, in particular, have repeatedly made headlines for banning the style. \nFew of the commonly banned styles are easy to alter around school hours \u2013 a student cannot dye, remove dreadlocks, or grow out their hair each morning. So through these policies, the school also controls the students\u2019 hair outside of school hours and in doing so, their gender, sexual, political or cultural identity. \n\nWhat should schools do instead\nRecent Australian research has called for school policies to be flexible when it comes to gender and culture so all students feel like they belong. \nWhen schools are reinforcing inflexible ideas about gender, sexuality, culture, race and class they are not including all students. Schools should review their hair policies to: \n\nremove gendered restrictions\nremove culturally exclusionary regulations\nquestion what norms are being privileged and  \nlimit their impact on student\u2019s bodily autonomy outside of school hours. \n\nWhile schools maintain they want to project a certain standard we have to ask what that standard is and why it is projected as an ideal for our communities.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Schools, Primary school, High school, School uniforms","role":"assistant"}]}

If the bill passes, they won\u2019t have to go through the standard residency and citizenship application processes.\nThe bill reverses the original law  passed in 1982 by the National government of Robert Muldoon. That law targeted people born in Samoa between May 1924 and January 1949 (and family who held citizenship through descent or marriage). \n\n\n\n\n\nDuring that period, Samoa was under New Zealand\u2019s administration, and many had come to New Zealand for work and education. The raids terrorised people in their beds, churches, schools and workplaces. They also resulted in the unnecessary placement of children into state care, and ongoing intergenerational fallout.\nPublic submissions on the bill close at the end of this week. But supporters should be wary of premature celebrations. Because the practice of dawn raids and the traumatic deportation of people for visa breaches continue to this day.\n\nThe raids continue\nIn 2021, following a petition by Benji Timu and Josiah Tualamali'i, the then prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, offered a formal apology to the Pacific community on behalf of the government. Ardern also took part in a traditional Samoan ifoga ceremony of apology.\nBut the dawn raids apology and new bill do not mean such discriminatory practices are a relic of New Zealand\u2019s past. Raids were happening in the lead-up to Ardern\u2019s apology and did not stop afterwards. \nUnder the Immigration Act 2009, Immigration New Zealand serves \u201cdeportation liability notices\u201d and \u201cdeportation orders\u201d to people liable for deportation because of expired visas and \u201cother public interest factors\u201d. \nSection 286 of the act allows an immigration officer to \u201center and search at any reasonable time by day or night any building or premises in which the officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person named in the notice or order is present\u201d.\nAn independent review by barrister Mike Heron found no legislative or policy efforts were made after Ardern\u2019s apology to end such raids or change the way Immigration New Zealand sought people for deportation. \nBetween 2015 and 2023, there were 95 dawn raids resulting in 101 deportations. In one incident in Auckland last year, immigration authorities forcibly removed an \u201coverstayer\u201d Tongan construction worker from his residence at 6am, according to his lawyer, in the presence of his four \u201cterrified [\u2026] and very upset\u201d children. \nBetween 2017 and 2023, 5,511 people were deported or left New Zealand voluntarily after being put on notice they were \u201cunlawfully\u201d in the country. People from Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, Tuvalu and Kiribati make up around a third of this number. \n\nMoving beyond \u2018penal nationalism\u2019\nPrime Minister Christopher Luxon made it clear while in opposition his government would likely \u201creserve the option\u201d of immigration raids: \u201cthe reality is, you need to be here legally [or] you could be liable for deportation\u201d.\nBroadly, this approach to immigration has been described as \u201cpenal nationalism\u201d: migration is treated as a threat, and tools such as police raids and detention are used to manage \u201cothers\u201d, especially people of colour who seek residence or citizenship. \nIf the new bill passes, 5,000 people now aged between 75 and 100 will be  eligible to have their citizenship restored. But some have argued compensation should be provided as well as, or even instead of, citizenship.\nEither way, despite the Heron report urging the government to restrict or ban dawn raids, the current law still allows them to happen. \nIt perpetuates the historical perception of Pacific workers as \u201cdisposable labour\u201d, recruited and ejected when it suits the employer and country. This is despite them having jobs, families and close ties in New Zealand.\nFriendship not fear\nThere need to be viable amnesty systems and pathways for Pacific \u201coverstayers\u201d to legally remain in New Zealand. In the rare cases where deportation is justified, those individuals should still be treated with dignity in accordance with their civil and political rights.\nNew Zealand should also help the reintegration of deportees in their home countries, where they can face ostracism, cultural and language barriers, and limited employment opportunities.\nAt the same time, Pacific nations need support for retaining their productive people in the first place, through building economic capacity and public infrastructure. \nUntil these things are the rule rather than the exception, the \u201cspirit of close friendship\u201d expressed in the 1962 Treaty of Friendship between Samoa and New Zealand remains unrealised.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Immigration, samoa, Pasifika","role":"assistant"}]}

Some research from North America suggests as many as one in 20 people may be in a polyamorous, swinging or open relationship \u2013 with one in five saying they\u2019d like to try it. \nAlthough multiple sexual partners potentially brings increased exposure to sexually transmitted infections, research has shown that consensually non-monogamous people are very good at practising safer sex. \nThey\u2019re more likely to discuss safer sex with their multiple partners. And, they test for sexually transmitted infections at significantly higher rates than monogamous people do.\nBeing able to access sexual healthcare is of great importance for consensually non-monogamous people. But many continue to face barriers when accessing sexual health services, as our research has shown.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn line with other research, we found stereotypes, myths and a general lack of understanding about consensual non-monogamy all act as potential barriers to healthcare. \nFor instance, when they go to their GP or clinic for testing, it\u2019s not unusual for them to be met by doctors and nurses who either don\u2019t understand their relationships or who actively stigmatise them. Approximately a third of our participants either never, or only sometimes, revealed their relationship style to medical professionals.\nAssumptions might be made about their relationship, with one participant saying: \u201cI was not asked \u2018Do you have multiple partners?\u2019 but \u2018do you have a boyfriend?\u2019, which was a confusing question full of assumptions.\u201d \nOr they might be treated with outright hostility, with another participant sharing, \u201cOne [doctor] considered it a form of cheating and intimate partner violence\u201d. \nIn the UK only 85% of medical students report having received training on working with patients who have diverse gender identities and sexualities. To our knowledge, no medical students are being trained on how to work with consensually non-monogamous patients. \n\nThis has serious implications, as a lack of understanding around consensual non-monogamy can create barriers to patients receiving appropriate healthcare and building trust with their providers. \nMany patients even told us about the frustrating interactions they\u2019d had as a result of this lack of knowledge and understanding.\n\nI told the doctor (a woman in her 50s) that at the moment I had one regular partner and we are polyamorous, so he also has other people, and sometimes I also have other partners. She reacted saying \u201cOh! How modern! And \u2026 are you ok with that?\u201d This wasn\u2019t great as it made me feel judged and she stepped into feeding her curiosity.\n\nSometimes, stigma can even result in not receiving the care they need. One participant reported going to their GP for birth control but being denied: \u201cThe GP immediately said I would have [sexually transmitted diseases] because of my \u2018lifestyle choices\u2019 and they could not prescribe birth control without doing STD testing.\u201d \nIt\u2019s not surprising that participants had significantly lower trust in healthcare providers than the general population. Nor is it surprising that consensually non-monogamous people are often quite picky about where they seek out sexual healthcare, as we found in our most recent study. \nMany of our study\u2019s participants reported feeling more trusting and at ease in sexual health clinics that were accustomed to helping people from diverse sexual backgrounds. One participant even revealed: \u201cIt has only been in LGBT spaces where I have not experienced judgement.\u201d\nFor others, however, a lack of services means they have to simply engage with what\u2019s available \u2013 sometimes lying to ensure a smoother ride. One participant revealed: \u201cI always say \u2018my partner is an asshole and cheats on me\u2019 then I get tested without an issue (maybe sympathy) rather than judgement of being poly.\u201d\nRemoving barriers\nTo remove these barriers, it\u2019s vital doctors and nurses develop a better understanding of consensual non-monogamy and the unique healthcare needs this group has. But this change needs to come from within institutions. Many who are consensually non-monogamous do not wish to take on the role of relationship educators \u2013 especially given the potential risks for stigma. \nAs time goes on, general awareness and exposure to realistic depictions of consensual non-monogamy will probably continue to increase. We may even one day see it taught as standard in relationship, sex and health education (although current trends in sex education suggest this is probably a long way off). \nBut until a time when the myths and stigma around consensual non-monogamy have been dispelled, the onus is on institutions to make sure their services are inclusive.\nThis might include using inclusive language, not making assumptions about relationship structures or getting familiar with terminology and practices within communities. These practices can help build and maintain trust between doctors and patients \u2013 and make it more likely that patients will receive the treatment they need.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Sexual health, Polyamory, Educate me, Ethical non-monogamy","role":"assistant"}]}

The far-right party continues to top the polls. It is expected to clinch a comfortable victory in the European elections on 9 June with almost 27% of the vote, well ahead of the Social Democrats of the SP\u00d6 (23%) and the conservatives of the \u00d6VP, currently in power (21%).\nWhat\u2019s more, polls also put the FP\u00d6 in first place in the country\u2019s legislative elections in September, with 30% of the vote (compared with 21% for the SP\u00d6 and 20% for the \u00d6VP). To the party\u2019s leaders, these encouraging predictions represent a historic opportunity to place one of their own in the post of Chancellor for the first time, a position held since 2021 by an \u00d6VP representative, Karl Nehammer.\nThe FP\u00d6, which was founded in 1956 and took off when it was led by the firebrand Jorg Ha\u00efder (1986-2000), has a history of reaching the gates of power without crossing it. The party reached second place in the elections of 1957, 1980, 2010 and 2022, and has participated in three government coalitions since its creation, the first with the Social Democrats between 1983 and 1986, the second and third with the conservatives of the \u00d6VP from 2000 to 2006, and from 2017 to 2019. But its leaders and activists sense the tide may have decisively turned in their favour.\nUnsinkable popularity?\nThe FP\u00d6\u2019s image seems to have come out largely unscathed from the Egisto Ott spying scandal, which has been rocking the country since March.\n\n\n\n\n\nA former domestic intelligence official, Egisto Ott was arrested on 29 March on suspicion of having passed on information to Russia in exchange for money. He is also alleged to have communicated the telephone data of three senior officials of the Austrian interior ministry to Moscow: Michael Kloibm\u00fcller (former head of the interior minister\u2019s private office), Michael Takacs (now director of the federal police) and Gernot Maier (head of the federal office for foreign affairs and asylum).\n\nIt is believed the affair unfolded during the period when the FP\u00d6\u2019s current president, Herbert Kickl, was interior minister. According to the Austrian press and the initial findings of the investigation, Ott began leaking information in 2017, when the FP\u00d6 was in power in coalition with the \u00d6VP. Could Kickl have been unaware of his actions? This question remains unanswered for the time being.\nThe FP\u00d6\u2019s opponents were quick to point to possible ideological ties between Egisto Ott and the party, citing the party\u2019s long-standing \u201ccomplacency\u201d toward Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia. To date, the police are trying to establish the link between the FP\u00d6 and Ott. The FP\u00d6 has rejected the accusations as a smear campaign.\nThe FP\u00d6 and Russia\u2019s long history\nWhat is certain is that the close relations between the FP\u00d6 and Russia are not new. In December\u00a02016, the FP\u00d6 and Vladimir Putin\u2019s party, United Russia, signed a Friendship treaty (Freundschaftsvertrag). The accord\u2019s main aim was to organise exchanges between the FP\u00d6 and United Russia and to set up partisan cooperation both at the ideological and organisational levels. Austrian and Russian delegations were to meet regularly and strengthen this cooperation.\nA few months ago, however, Herbert Kickl explained that this treaty was no longer valid and, on the FP\u00d6\u2019s side, was even considered null and void. Another leading figure in the FP\u00d6, Norbert Hofer, echoed him by stressing that the treaty had been concluded at a time when the Russian president was acceptable to many:\n\nIt was a time when Russian politicians and President Putin were warmly welcomed throughout Europe and many politicians travelled to Moscow to meet Putin in person.\n\nNevertheless, the FP\u00d6 and Russia have long enjoyed a close rapport. In 2018, the then FP\u00d6 foreign affairs minister invited Vladimir Putin to her wedding and, notoriously, danced with the Russian president. One year later, she left the government, and in 2021, landed a position on the board of directors of the Russian oil group Rosneft. In 2023, she moved to Russia to run a think tank.\n\nSince February\u00a02022, the FP\u00d6 has repeatedly argued against sanctions against Russia. Even today, Herbert Kickl continues to argue that these sanctions only postpone the hope of a possible negotiation between Ukrainians and Russians, and are detrimental to Austrian interests.\nThe FP\u00d6\u2019s aggressive European campaign\nIt is in a very particular context that the FP\u00d6 has thrown itself into the battle of the European elections. In the 2019 elections, the party had to content itself with third place at \u201conly\u201d 17.2% of the vote, far behind the \u00d6VP and the SP\u00d6, which had respectively obtained 34.6% and 23.9%. This time, the European elections in June could well result in a clear victory for the far-right party. If the polls prove accurate, the FP\u00d6 could come close to its best ever score in all national elections, achieved in the 1999 European elections with 27.53%.\nFor this election, the FP\u00d6 has chosen to renew its confidence in a seasoned politician, Harald Vilimsky, who was appointed at the start of January to head the list for the third time after 2014 and 2019. Vilimsky is a leading figure in the movement, having served as a member of the National Council (2006-2014) and as a Member of the European Parliament since 2014.\nAlso on the FP\u00d6 list is Petra Steger, the daughter of former Austrian Vice-Chancellor Norbert Steger, leader of the FP\u00d6 from 1980 to 1986. Like her father, Petra Steger is considered to be more of a moderate liberal within the party, although on many issues she happily embraces the movement\u2019s conservative positions. Having her on its list is therefore a way for the FP\u00d6 to strike a middle ground between the party\u2019s traditional, and rather radical, electorate, and a more moderate one.\nAt a March press conference, Herbert Kickl reiterated his desire to fight against \u201cthe migration of peoples\u201d from Africa and the Arab world, and against Austria\u2019s loss of sovereignty to the EU. For his part, Harald Vilimsky hammered home the point that Europe\u2019s \u201celites\u201d were \u201cout of touch with the aspirations of the people\u201d and that the only way to remedy this was to slip an FP\u00d6 ballot paper into the ballot box. Since his election to the European Parliament in 2014, Vilimsky has become a champion in Austria of the fight against \u201cEuropean and Brussels centralism\u201d.\nIn these European elections, the FP\u00d6\u2019s programme is aggressive and unambiguous. Entitled \u201cEU-Wahnsinn Stoppen\u201d (Halt to the madness of the EU), it does not advocate Austria leaving the EU, but calls for in-depth reform of the Union and an end to all of Brussel\u2019s \u201cpolitical excesses\u201d. The key measures advocated include cutting red tape within the EU an immediate halt to what is thought to be an out-of-control immigration, and zero tolerance of illegal asylum applications and tighter border control.\n\nLeading in the opinion polls makes the FP\u00d6 the main target of its opponents in the SP\u00d6 and \u00d6VP; the latter, who fear that their electorate will shift to the FP\u00d6, are the most virulent. The head of the \u00d6VP list, Reinhold Lopatka, stresses that, unlike the FP\u00d6, he and his party see the EU as a partner rather than an adversary. He also openly accuses the FP\u00d6 and Harald Vilimsky of being Vladimir Putin\u2019s \u201coutstretched arm\u201d and of seeing the EU only as an \u201cenemy\u201d. These criticisms have not, however, prevented the \u00d6VP from taking up political themes dear to the FP\u00d6, starting with the fight against immigration and asylum applications.\nCan the FP\u00d6 still lose?\nContrary to what you might think, a majority of Austrians have a rather negative view of the future of the EU, which could well \u201csuit\u201d the FP\u00d6. According to a poll published in the Der Standard newspaper on 6 May, 63% of those questioned believe that the EU is moving in the wrong direction \u2013 a figure that is not reassuring for the \u00d6VP and SP\u00d6, who are still hoping to wrest first place from the FP\u00d6 just a few weeks before the elections.\nAs things stand, nothing seems to be able to halt the FP\u00d6\u2019s irresistible rise. It has been able to withstand accusations of closeness to Russia and the Egisto Ott affair. What\u2019s more, the party is banking on a certain weariness and even distrust of the political leaders currently in power, and from the internal political disputes of the two major traditional parties. Austrians are yearning for real change, which \u2013 at least they think \u2013 is the only thing the FP\u00d6 could potentially offer.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Far-right politics, Central Europe, Austrian politics, Russian interference, The Conversation Europe, European elections 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

The relationship between AI and democracy is the topic of many, increasingly urgent conversations taking place around the world.\nMore than 60 countries will head to the polls in 2024, in what has been dubbed \u201cthe biggest election year in history\u201d. Australia is expecting to hold elections in the Northern Territory and Queensland this year, with a federal election due by May 2025.\nAt the same time, the explosion of generative AI tools for text, images, audio and video is dramatically shifting the way Australians create and engage with information. How can we maintain the integrity and trust of elections in the age of generative AI? \n\n\n\n\n\nDeepfakes and disinformation\nThe most obvious risk AI poses to democracy is via synthetic content (or \u201cdeepfakes\u201d), which could be used to misinform voters. A World Economic Forum survey conducted last year found experts ranked \u201cmisinformation and disinformation\u201d and \u201csocietal polarisation\u201d as the first and third most severe global risks over the next two years. \nThese risks are already manifesting. In the United States, a political consultant, who used the synthetic voice of US President Joe Biden in robocalls, faces fines of several million dollars. In India, AI-generated videos have become increasingly common in this year\u2019s election campaign.\nBut deepfakes and misinformation are far from the only risks. AI also presents new opportunities. In the evidence I gave to the senate committee,  and in a submission from me and my colleagues at the Tech Policy Design Centre, we argue a fuller national conversation on this topic is essential.\nA broad view of healthy democracy\nA comprehensive policy will not focus purely on deepfakes swaying votes but the health of democracy more broadly. Free and fair elections are one characteristic of democracy (albeit an incredibly important one), but there are many others. \nInformed civic engagement, tolerance and political pluralism are other important ingredients of a thriving democratic system. The system also needs to identify and respond to the needs of the electorate, and government must be transparent and accountable.\nSo when we think about the relationship between AI and democracy, we need to think about perennial concerns such as political representation, public interest journalism, media literacy and social cohesion.\nRisks \u2013 but also opportunities\nA balanced policy should recognise AI technologies present opportunities for democracy, as well as risks.\nFor example, it is absolutely reasonable to worry informed civic engagement may suffer due to the tendency of generative AI models to \u201challucinate\u201d and produce misinformation. \nHowever, the very same technology can also engage more voters in civic discourse: it can convert complex policy concepts into relatable content, or create automatic translations into many languages.\nLearning from the past\nSome elements of the challenges we face are not as new or certain as they seem.\nAI, and the generative AI boom in particular, certainly injects some unprecedented elements into the democratic ecosystem. But there are still lessons we can learn from the past. \nAnxieties about technologies that make novel forms of communication widely accessible are not new. Nor are efforts to regulate and control who can influence public flows of information. \nIn the 15th century the invention of Gutenberg\u2019s printing press stoked fears over what we might now call \u201cfake news\u201d. There are plenty more recent examples, including what we have learned from the rise of social media (which is in turn shaping the story of AI and democracy). \nWe need to be discerning about the elements of generative AI that are fundamentally new. At the same time, we can look for applicable policy tools and lessons from previous information technology revolutions.\nWhat now for Australia?\nAustralia is standing at an interesting crossroads. Up to a year out from our next federal election, several interlocking branches of policy are in development.\nThe department of industry is working on a response to last year\u2019s Safe and Responsible AI consultation. This will include considering rules for compulsory watermarks in AI-generated content.\nThe department of communications is also reworking proposals for new powers for the Australian Communications and Media Authority. These will help to combat misinformation and disinformation, and may include AI-specific measures.\nAt the same time, the Online Safety Act 2021 is being reviewed. This may result in powers to address online abuse of public figures, which again may involve AI.\nI propose four key actions the Australian government should take.\nFirst, it should develop a coordinated national approach to the relationship between AI and democracy. My colleagues at the Tech Policy Design Centre have offered more detailed recommendations on how to coordinate the development of national tech policies.\nSecond, the government should pay close attention to the dozens of national elections around the world this year. We can monitor the success or failure of different policies in different contexts to learn from the experiences of others.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Taiwan is experiencing millions of cyberattacks every day. The world should be paying attention\n\n\n\n\nThird, we can learn from South Korea by requiring politicians to disclose and watermark any deepfakes or other AI-produced content used in election materials. South Korea has barred politicians from using AI-generated materials in their campaigns completely. However, the lower bar of requiring Australian politicians to be transparent may be less controversial and easier to implement.\nAnd fourth, the government needs to make sure the Australian Electoral Commission and the Australian Communication and Media Authority have the staff and resources they need. Their task of tackling emerging challenges, including those posed by AI, and equipping Australians to engage  with a complex information landscape in the year ahead will not be an easy one.\nThese steps should be just the beginning of a comprehensive, balanced and informed national conversation about how we can support Australia\u2019s democracy to flourish in the age of AI.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), Democracy, Misinformation, Disinformation, Deepfakes, Election misinformation","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nOn the eve of the Second World War, three Oxbridge graduates joined forces in London and wrote a pamphlet calling for the union of Britain with other democracies to avert the coming conflict. They sent the short pamphlet, titled \u201cFederal Union\u201d, to more than 500 opinion-makers in Britain. The warm reception of their federalist ideas led to the launch of an organisation named after the pamphlet. By 1939 more than 200 branches of the organisation were founded all over Britain, with more than 10,000 members.\nYet the \u201cPhony War\u201d of 1939 ended with the \nfall of France in 1940, and also public enthusiasm about federalism. The Federal Union responded by founding the Federal Union Research Institute (FURI) to study the advantages and means of transnational federation. The scholarly discussions, aimed at transforming the opinions of policy-makers and the public, were often concerned with economic issues, including fiscal policies, currency, trade, social services, migration and labour.\nThe heyday of economic pluralism?\nWith the latest European elections in sight and right-wing parties on the rise, FURI remains a fascinating example for early debates on the economic aspects of European federation. The institute attracted economists of different creeds, including William Beveridge, Lionel Robbins, Friedrich Hayek, James Meade and Barbara Wootton. While they all were convinced that nationalism was the cause of war and strife, they had different views on the economic advantages of federation. Should it facilitate planning on a transnational scale or foster free trade? How could a federation benefit the working classes not only by averting war, but also by transforming the economy?\nThe unofficial leader of FURI was William Beveridge, a liberal economist nowadays mostly known in England as the father of the British welfare state. In 1940, he published \u201cPeace by Federation\u201d, a pamphlet in which he explored how federalism could end the war, but soon engaged in debating the economic implications of federalism. Beveridge would later become known for his writings on welfare politics, most famously his 1942 report \u201cSocial Insurance and Allied Services\u201d, which established the foundations for the British National Health Service. \n\n\n\n\n\nPreviously sceptical of the possibility of a state-directed economy, the war transformed his thinking in favour of economic planning and state intervention. For him, centrally organised and distributed goods and services did not mean the end of liberty, despite potential social improvement. Nonetheless, he was persuaded that economic planning demanded a high degree of political consensus, which was not at that stage present on the federal scale. Thus, he shied away from envisaging economic plans on a federal scale.\nThose who objected to state intervention in the economy often justified their position as a defence of individual liberty. Friedrich Hayek, whose Road to Serfdom and Constitution of Liberty \u2013 a book that Margaret Thatcher carried in her handbag \u2013 advanced a vision of liberal federalism aimed at minimising the role of the state and its political institutions. Hayek sought to shift the political and economic power of nation states to two institutional levels: local communities and federal government. He envisaged a minimal European federal government aimed at defending the free market from state intervention, and local communities that could undertake a degree of planning with limited local impact. For him, other forms of economic planning on federal level entailed an unbearable limit on liberty that could only be tolerated in limited situations.\nA Europe for the working classes\nYet there was a dissenting voice at Federal Union, whose vision endowed the federal institutions with powers to intervene in the economy through planning on large scale: sociologist and economist Barbara Wootton, who always prioritised the economic and social demands of the impoverished working class. For her, British and European workers alike deserved better living conditions, which would be best realised through centralised planning.\nIn contrast with Hayek, Wootton challenged the notion that freedom could be the foundation of politics, and advanced instead a political vision based on an inclusive interpretation of \u201cequality\u201d, which demanded popular participation in political and economic life. According to her internationalist socialist creed, equality should be envisaged beyond the borders of the nation state, which was too exclusive, protectionist, and belligerent to provide prosperity and social relief to the citizens. Thus, for Wootton, a transnational federation \u2013 initially European but potentially global \u2013 could provide an inclusive, diverse and effective space for social-economic planning for the benefit of the working classes.\nIn Wootton\u2019s mind, a federal democracy meant not only that the individual had an equal right to do, but also equal right to get. She based her proposals on practical economics rather than theory. She envisaged, for example, a migration policy that could respond to the needs of labour markets in different parts of the federation, and redistribution of resources to respond to the basic needs of all citizens. When John Maynard Keynes, her family friend, proposed the establishment of the International Clearing Union, and the international currency \u201cBancor\u201d, she argued that his ideas could facilitate her vision of a transnational federal economy (although Keynes was no federalist himself).\nA European federation would have an important advantage of scale over its member states: a European social-economic plan could rely on greater variety and volume of natural and human resources, and could thus be more effective in transforming the living standards of the working classes to enhance global equality.\nLessons for modern Europe\nDebates about social justice and economic planning at Federal Union dissipated by the end of the war. By then the prospects of a European federation seemed less viable. Beveridge and Wootton turned to welfare and social reform on national scale. Hayek moved to the United States where he increasingly devoted himself to studying and promoting global capitalist liberalism.\nWootton was exceptional, then as now, in placing the concerns of the working classes at the centre of her attention. Her democratic federation was tailored for their economic needs and wants. She hoped that a federation based on democracy and equality could mobilise the working classes to advance political change. Yet in the 1940s her aspirations failed to come to life. Can her vision still resonate with European politicians and voters today? What would a social Europe, tailored for the \u201cwants\u201d (to use Wootton\u2019s term) of the working classes look like in our modern age? To imagine this kind of Europe, we should build on Wootton\u2019s legacy of economic pluralism, that embeds theory with economic practice to offer a truly democratic idea of social justice.\nThe enthusiastic economic debate at Federal Union was a meeting point for liberal, ordo-liberal and socialist ideas. The economists did not take for granted that the federal economy should follow the logic of the market. They discussed federation as a means to tackle inequality. Even in this context, some ideas were more original than others. Wootton\u2019s vision of transnational welfare was a radical alternative to mainstream liberal economics. For her, popular welfare demands counted more than safeguarding the freedom of individuals or markets. The welfare of the working classes was a major challenge that required a radical solution, a deep transformation of politics and economics. Many at Federal Union deemed Wootton\u2019s solution impractical, yet her vision stood apart, and can still offer insights in contemporary debate on European economics, where a heterodox approach can open up prospects for a more social EU.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Europe, Socialism, Federalism, World War II, Political history, Economic theories, The Conversation Europe","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nThere has been much discussion in recent years about satire\u2019s role in the online world \u2013 and the risks we face from it being misunderstood.\nIn a recent article, NewsGuard editorial director Eric Effron bemoaned the fact that satire mistaken for news is stoking disinformation and political division. He even suggests satire should be explicitly labelled. \nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s not really a fair proposal.\nSatire: a slippery slope\nIf a certain work \u2013 whether it be an article, performance, essay or meme \u2013 is to operate as satire, it has to be recognised by its audience as satire. \nWhile this may sound circular, it is important. Satire that is widely mistaken for news ceases to be satire and instead becomes misinformation. Then if someone circulates it knowingly, it becomes disinformation, and they are acting badly.\nWhat should be done about this issue is a more complicated question. Satire has some cultural and legal licence, wherein it is hard-earned and mostly justified as a contribution to civic debate and democratic practice. But it can be messy.\n\nA work is what we make it\nBack in 1702, English novelist Daniel Defoe published a pamphlet called The Shortest Way with the Dissenters. He wrote anonymously, which was normal at the time, but also integral to his satirical purpose. \nDefoe was known as a prominent dissenter \u2013 specifically, a Protestant dissenting from the established Church of England. Considering his pamphlet appears to recommend the execution or expulsion of all dissenters, publishing it under his real name would have spoiled his joke.\nUnfortunately for Defoe, he was too good a mimic. A lot of readers took the persona of his text \u2013 a bigoted little Englander (who would be right at home in the current UK election) \u2013 at face value. Moreover, a lot of the readers agreed with the persona and thought the proposal a damned good idea. \nWhen Defoe announced the point of the joke, the readers were so annoyed at being fooled that they prosecuted him for seditious libel and he spent time in the stocks.\nI tell this story to make two points. The first is that satire without a clear play-frame around it takes a risk by relying on its audience to get the joke. The second is that misunderstanding satire is part of the genre, and can be traced back to long before the digital age.\nThat the internet now allows satire to circulate rapidly and more idiotically as \u201cfake news\u201d reflects a change in quantity but not in kind. \nThat said, the situation is admittedly getting worse. Artificial intelligence (AI) is particularly ill-equipped to understand the framing and intentional context needed to spot satire. All AI sees is a plausible pattern of words to ingest into its language model. \nIf, like me, you are cranky enough to think truthfulness matters, this situation looks bad.\nWould labels even work?\nIn 2019, a research team from The Ohio State University found clearly labelling satirical content as satire could \u201chelp social media users navigate a complex and sometimes confusing news environment\u201d.\nIt\u2019s superficially an attractive idea. If the satire labels stayed in place, everyone would know (as fictional examples) that Anthony Albanese isn\u2019t really an Albanian spy, or that Peter Dutton isn\u2019t really descended from patrone potatoes. Or perhaps it would finally prevent Australian news outlets from republishing stories from The Betoota Advocate.\n\nHowever, there are practical and principled problems in the proposition. \nIn practice, it is hard to see how satire labels would stick to texts as they circulate. Words or tokens marking a text would easily fall off in recirculation, be shorn off on purpose, or may never be added in the first place if the work comes from a bad actor. \nAn alternative could be some method of deeply encrypted digital watermarking. But this might also be impractical and would risk coercive control by whatever authority is enforcing the rules.\nSimilarly, voluntary satire labelling would only work if everyone obeyed these rules, which seems unlikely. Misinformation would still spread through human carelessness. \nDisinformation would also spread. And we may even see deliberate hoaxers thrive as the good citizens of the world come to expect satire to always be appropriately labelled.\nThe right to be fooled\nA lot of satire announces itself as such by the way it is framed. A political cartoon or a mock-news website tells the audience to look for laughter. \nBut to go back to Defoe, some satire\u2019s provocative effect depends on it being mistakable as a sincere work. If The Shortest Way had been given the 18th-century equivalent of a laugh track, it would have ended up merely preaching to the converted.\nAnd here is where I have a democratic resistance to the compulsory labelling of satire. It\u2019s my job as a citizen to work out whether something is satire or a statement of fact. \nI have a right to be fooled \u2013 and I\u2019m not comfortable with waiving that right to some truth-and-joke-discerning authority. They may be diligent and pure-spirited fact-checkers with my best interest at heart, as wise as the Guardians in Plato\u2019s Republic. Or they may not.\nOne of the reasons satire has developed in some cultures and is suppressed in others is because it makes space for dissent and for the dissemination of narratives other than those of the powerful. This often leads to crackpot ideas, but it is the citizens\u2019 job to sort those things out. \nWe\u2019re in the early days of the digital revolution, so chaos often wins out over clarity, tolerance and sense. But while this is annoying, the better path forward is through the mess, rather than towards technical fixes.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Media, Democracy, Satire, Free speech, Public discourse, Political satire, Misinformation, public debate, Fake news, AI misinformation, Satirical media","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nI began teaching Stanley Kubrick in 2007 shortly after I moved to Bangor University. In 2012, I embarked on a research project exploring what I called Kubrick\u2019s ethics, ethnicity and archives. It was during that research, which was published as Stanley Kubrick: New York Jewish Intellectual in 2018, that I began to notice how the work of Franz Kafka echoed down the corridors of Kubrick\u2019s work.\nKubrick was born in 1928 and in the decade that followed, Kafka\u2019s work began to appear in English. Kubrick became an avid reader of Kafka\u2019s fiction and later named him \u201cthe greatest writer of the century, and the most misread\u201d. \u201cPeople who used the word \u2018Kafkaesque\u2019 had probably never read Kafka\u201d, he told his friend the journalist Michael Herr.\nLater, when publicising his film A Clockwork Orange in 1972, Kubrick compared himself to the author: \u201cI have a wife, three children, three dogs, seven cats. I\u2019m not a Franz Kafka, sitting alone and suffering.\u201d It was an interesting comparison, one that suggested more parallels than it dispelled.\n\nAs we mark 100 years since the death of the writer, it is fascinating to speculate what drew Kubrick to Kafka.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt may well have been because of their shared central European and Jewish heritage. Kubrick\u2019s ancestors, like Kafka, hailed from parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire. \nIn addition to their shared Mitteleuropean roots and ethnicity, Kubrick loved how Kafka wrote. He described it as \u201ca simple, not-baroque style, so that the fantastic is treated in a very everyday, ordinary way\u201d. On another occasion, he said: \u201cHis stories are fantastic and allegorical, but his writing is simple and straightforward, almost journalistic.\u201d\nAs noted in my latest book about Kubrick, a Kafkaesque sense of dread is more or less evident in each of Kubrick\u2019s films, sometimes explicit but mostly lurking in the shadows of their frames. Like Kafka\u2019s stories, Kubrick\u2019s films combined irony, the absurd, eeriness, elements of surrealism and black humour that undercut his simultaneous insistence on realism.\nMuch like the writing of his beloved Kafka, Kubrick aimed \u201cto photograph things realistically.\u201d He told film critic Gene Siskel that he lit things \u201cas they would be lit [in] urban daylight\u201d because \u201cI\u2019m after a realistic, documentary-type look\u201d. This is evident in the photorealistic battle sequences in Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) and Full Metal Jacket (1987). It is also particularly manifest in his 1980 horror masterpiece, The Shining.\n\n\nThis article is part of our series marking 100 years since the death of writer Franz Kafka. These articles explore his legacy and influence on everything from cinema to law. To read more click here.\n\nIn the early 1960s, as he was working on the screenplay for what became Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick described it as a \u201cKafkaesque satirical comedy about nuclear war. This seems to me the only honest way to deal with the thing.\u201d\nDuring the filming of Eyes Wide Shut, actor Alan Cumming recalled how the cast and Kubrick chatted about Kafka on set. Bill (Tom Cruise) is trailed by a mysterious, unnamed man who could have stepped out of a Kafka story. There is a knishery (usually a potato and dough snack) and bagel shop Kubrick had built on the studio backlot called Josef Kreibich\u2019s, resonating with Kafka\u2019s Josef K from The Trial. The mysterious Hungarian partygoer, Sandor Szavost, quotes Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses, obliquely invoking Kafka\u2019s most famous work. The scenes in the costume shop might well have come straight out of The Trial. \n\nMetamorphoses are evident throughout Kubrick\u2019s work. Just as Gregor Samsa is transformed into a giant beetle, Jack in The Shining also changes during the film. \nDavid Bowman at the end of 2001: A Space Odyssey transforms into the Star Child. One scholar noted how its ending \u201cresembles Kafka and is obviously meant to do so.\u201d On this note, it is telling that in his copy of Kafka\u2019s Parables and Paradoxes (1961), Kubrick wrote, \u201cThe tower of Babel was the start of the space age.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Kafka 100: struggles of disabled characters in systems that don't support them feel just as relevant today\n\n\n\n\nKafka\u2019s 1917 short story, A Report to an Academy, satirises the Jewish assimilatory experience in western civil society by comparing it to that of a captive, mimicking ape. \nIn Kubrick\u2019s A Clockwork Orange, Alex\u2019s similarity to a simian from 2001 also hints at this. Alex\u2019s movement is apelike, such as when he wanders around his flat, scratching his posterior. As our \u201chumble narrator\u201d, he\u2019s aware of the bars of his cage, becoming a version of Kafka\u2019s ape Red Peter in A Report to an Academy. \n\nFollowing the administration of the Ludovico Technique, which itself recalls the slow inscription of the punishment on the victim\u2019s body in Kafka\u2019s 1919 story In the Penal Colony, Alex is incapacitated by nausea and lies flat on his back, helpless, like Gregor Samsa. \nThe spectre of Franz Kafka hangs over much of Kubrick\u2019s work if you know where to look for it. Like Kafka, Kubrick earned the suffix \u201cesque\u201d as he carved out a distinctive oeuvre of his own. But the parallels between them go beyond their shared greatness, and Kubrick\u2019s films are a fitting tribute and gateway to Kafka, a centenary after the author\u2019s death.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Film, Franz Kafka, Stanley Kubrick, Give me perspective, Kafka 100","role":"assistant"}]}

My colleagues Mary-Anne Kyriakou (who would later be Vivid\u2019s inaugural festival director) and Michael Day are sharing a vision of what\u2019s almost unthinkable at the time. \nThey paint a picture of a light festival in which the winter of Sydney has become vibrant in colour: buildings are illuminated, streets are alive with creative light installations and the crowds walk about in awe. It is a vision that would soon become Vivid Sydney. \nThis year\u2019s program promises to impress once again with a diverse range of content including Julia Gutman\u2019s first ever animation work, Echo, a story of wonder, vulnerability and strength displayed on the shells of the Sydney Opera House. \n\nInstallations such as Stateless and Humanity by Sinclair Park touch on world issues in ways that offer both delight and prompt reflection. \nWe also see First Nations artist Tori-Jay Mordey\u2019s work, Faces of Change, on the pylons of Sydney Harbour Bridge. It explores, among other themes, humanity\u2019s connection to nature and the threat that rising sea levels pose to the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nOn the lighter side, there\u2019s a Tekno Train you can have a rave on, and some parties held in a 100-year-old heritage substation.\nIt\u2019s my hope Vivid Sydney will continue to captivate locals and visitors this year, and for the years to come. But while we look forward to these experiences, let\u2019s also look at the challenges to overcome. \n\nWhen it all began\nThe inaugural Smart Light Sydney event was staged in May 2009, laying the foundation for Vivid. The shells of the Sydney Opera House became a canvas for the festival\u2019s first headline projection by Brian Eno. \nSeveral small and large installations were staged across Circular Quay and the Rocks, with various landmark buildings lit up. A number of light artists and designers participated with passion, somewhat tight budgets, and relatively modest works compared to today\u2019s.\n\nSmart Light Sydney offered glimpses of what could be possible in the future. Support from the government and private sector soon followed, and the stage was set for the future of Vivid. \nThroughout the 2010s, Vivid inspired a number of smaller and regional towns in New South Wales and beyond to experiment with how lighting could become a spectacle and contribute to their own nightscapes. \nIn just a few years, Vivid evolved from a modest initiative into a globally recognised celebration of light, music and ideas \u2013 positioning itself next to longer-running festivals such as Lyon\u2019s famous F\u00eate des Lumi\u00e8res, Montr\u00e9al en Lumi\u00e8re and the Berlin Festival of Lights.\nA balancing act\nThe success of such a massive festival will, of course, come with challenges. Vivid, for instance, must grapple with balancing genuine artistic endeavour with the objective of attracting the masses. \nThis is a fine and delicate balance. If tipped, Vivid could fall into the trap of prioritising spectacle over substance. Some critics already contend that the festival emphasises grandiosity in a way that overshadows creative pursuit.\nIn recent years, the public and politicians have also criticised key light installations being ticketed, including this year\u2019s Lightscape in the Botanic Gardens and Dark Spectrum in the Wynyard Tunnels. \n\nPerhaps ticketing these offerings helps kerb visitor numbers so they can remain enjoyable (albeit for a smaller number of people). Or it may provide the revenue needed for the festival to deliver more innovative and valuable experiences. \nNonetheless, the decision has sparked debate over the commercialisation of what started as a cultural community event. Numerous corporate-sponsored installations have also now become centrepieces of the festival.\n\nBeyond this is a growing challenge for creatives to build on what has already been done. The installations and projections this year again showcase great examples of what can be achieved through the creative use of light and technology. As the festival matures, however, people\u2019s expectations also grow.\n\nSustainability and logistical challenges\nEnvironmental impact and sustainability are key considerations when thinking about Vivid\u2019s future. The festival\u2019s website details actions it has taken to deliver on this front, which have included partly offsetting its carbon footprint, using more renewable power, installing taps to reduce plastic landfill, encouraging public transport and going paper-free when possible. \nNonetheless, environmental issues remain intrinsic to an event of this scale. The festival\u2019s light pollution and reliance on large-scale energy consumption are points of contention, especially as awareness of these issues grows. Among all the environmental challenges the festival faces, using dark-sky friendly lighting is perhaps one of the most tricky.\nAnother challenge is that the festival\u2019s growth has somewhat strained local infrastructure, leading to overcrowded public spaces and transport systems. During the festival weeks, portaloos, barricades and other temporary infrastructure also decorate the city.\nWhile Vivid puts in a notable effort into remaining accessible and inclusive for all, the sheer number of attendees (supposedly 3.4 million last year) means managing this size comes with many hurdles.\n\nWhat the future may hold\nThese challenges aren\u2019t unique to Vivid Sydney. They are faced by many similar events. In each context, there is nuance and also unique opportunities. \nVivid could play a profound, flagship role in showcasing Australia\u2019s design culture to its own people and to the world. This is a culture characterised by kindness, fairness, diversity, creativity and a commitment to innovation and sustainability. \nPerhaps Vivid\u2019s future doesn\u2019t rely on getting bigger and brighter, but on the finer aspects of its content. From embracing Indigenous wisdom, to connecting to nature, to highlighting world-class architecture and lighting design \u2013 Vivid has the potential to reinvent itself year on year.\nBut it will need to continue to deliver spectacle with subtlety to achieve this, and tell stories that touch people on a deeper level. Perhaps, unconventionally, it makes sense to embrace the darkness as much as the light. \n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Design, Vivid, Vivid Sydney, Entertainment, festival, arts festivals, Visual art and design","role":"assistant"}]}

Unfortunately, current scenarios answer only the first question \u2013 and at that, only partially. Research carried out at the EDHEC Risk Climate Institute tries to provide approximate but \u201cactionable\u201d answers to the second.\nClimate stress testing dates back to the 1990s, when teams of scientists collaborated to create a scenario framework that was to set the analytical standards for decades to come.\nThey did so by sketching out a handful of narratives about how the world may evolve, socially and economically. These are now referred to as shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The narratives were combined with a range of projected carbon emissions, known as representative carbon pathways (RCPs). Each narrative was run through every emission projection using process-based integrated assessment models (IAMS), which were fine-tuned on a case-by-case basis to reflect as closely as possible each of the narratives. At this point, the only degree of freedom left to match the narrative with the emission projection was the social cost of carbon \u2013 roughly speaking, the tax that should be levied on the \u201cconsumers\u201d of carbon emissions, and whose proceeds should be channeled to emission reductions.\nThe SSP-RCP approach, as it is now known, was endorsed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and has deservedly became a standard framework. \n\n\n\n\n\nAn analysis framework that\u2019s showing its age\nDespite its strengths, the SSP-RCP approach isn\u2019t perfect, nor does it adequately fulfills the need of all scenario users. Indeed, two decades after their introduction, the SSP-RCP approach is showing signs of ageing. \nWe argue that its revision should be carried out along three distinct lines, each addressing one of the problems with the present modelling framework:\n\nLet\u2019s consider the narratives first. They are presented in a rich and colourful language (there is mention of \u201cresurgent nationalism\u201d, \u201cgrowing inequality\u201d, etc.), but the only levers at the disposal of the models that try to capture these narratives are the rates of demographic and economic growth, the carbon intensity (emissions per unit of energy) and the energy intensity (energy per unit of GDP). If each of these variables can just exist in three possible states \u2013 say, high, medium, and low \u2013 that gives us 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 81 narratives. So, the six narratives chosen by the IPCC are but a small subset of all the possible worlds that may occur.\nCould the IPCC\u2019s six narratives be the most likely ones? We cannot tell, because no probabilities were associated to the scenarios \u2013 and this, we contend, is the second big shortcoming of current scenarios. Without any probabilistic information, we cannot tell which scenarios we should really worry about, and which can be safely set aside.\nThe third problem is the modelling choice in the SSP\/RCP set-up, where each narrative is associated with the most likely trajectory for each of the driving variables. This is reasonable, but fails to convey the huge uncertainty around the key estimates. This creates a misplaced sense of predictability, often expressed in tenth-of-degree precision. In reality, knowing how uncertain we are about an outcome can be as important as knowing the expected value for this outcome.\n\nDoing better\nHow can these shortcomings be fixed? An attractive strategy can be sketched along the following lines. First, we can simplify the problem by recognizing that carbon intensity, energy intensity and the rate of demographic growth are all linked to how rich a region is: richer countries tend to have lower fertility; to use more services than goods (lowering their carbon footprint); and to use fewer emissions to generate one unit of energy. \nSo if we can model economic growth (and its uncertainty!), we can estimate GDP per person on the one hand, and all the other main drivers of climate change on the other. This is helpful, because economists have devoted decades of work to modelling economic growth \u2013 work that can be adapted to the needs of climate-scenario modelling, allowing us to estimate with some confidence how GDP per person evolves over time (after taking climate damages into account). From this we can infer how population growth and the decarbonization of the economy are likely to evolve. While challenging, the task is well defined.\nFigures 1 and 2 give an idea of what this approach can yield. To create them, we have assumed that each of the four key variables (economic growth, carbon intensity, energy intensity and population growth, in order) can exist in a \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d or \u201chigh\u201d state (associated with the first, second, or third tercile of their distributions, respectively, and labelled a, b and c). Figure 1 then shows the 10 most likely scenarios, and Figure 2 displays the average temperature in each of these scenarios (given an emission pathway).\nTemperatures in the various scenarios\n\nAn example of one question this analysis can answer is the following: are lower temperatures obtained in states of high or low economic growth? The answer is not obvious, because high GDP generates more emissions, but also reduces population growth and carbon and energy intensities. This means that there is a tug of war between economic growth (with the attending increased use of energy), and the reduction in carbon intensity and population growth associated with richer economies. \nFigure 2 reveals that the higher temperatures occur in the states of high economic growth, suggesting that \u2013 as least for the abatement schedule examined and the model used \u2013 the GDP effect dominates: we cannot just grow our way out of our climate predicament.\nScenario probabilities\n\nWhat we have presented should not be regarded as the final word on the matter, but as a work in progress project. Despite its limitations, we think our approach is a useful first step in the probabilistic direction toward which scenarios must move.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Climate modelling, Probability, The Conversation France, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), The Conversation Europe","role":"assistant"}]}

The situation in Scotland and Northern Ireland is not much better. A survey by the Local Government Association in February 2024 found that 48% of local authorities say they plan to defund, to varying degrees, the parks and other green spaces within their areas. \nEngland\u2019s urban green spaces alone are estimated to provide up to \u00a36.6 billion in benefits to the communities that use them each year. Yet using them isn\u2019t open to everyone. \nThere is significant social inequality in terms of access to urban green spaces. In December 2023, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs parliamentary committee heard evidence that the most affluent 20% of urban wards have as much as five times more publicly accessible green space that the most deprived wards. \nUrban green spaces have long been poorly funded and vulnerable to local government budget cuts. The question then is how to create more inclusive and sustainable green spaces in our cities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUrban green space under threat\nAfter Birmingham city council effectively declared bankruptcy in 2023, it voted on a series of budget cuts amounting to \u00a3300 million. All non-statutory spending was frozen, which included funding for parks, gardens and other green assets. \nThe Save Birmingham lobbying group was subsequently set up to create an index of assets of community value. The idea, in the long term, is to find co-operative models for running these important spaces. \nThe 2023 State of Nature report (produced by a consortium of conservation and research organisations) highlights the UK as \u201cone of the most nature depleted\u201d countries on Earth. It reveals shocking levels of decline between 1970 and 2019 in plant distribution across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, including 54% for certain flowering plant species and 59% for Bryophytes (which includes mosses and liverworts). As part of a wider solution, the report states that \u201cthe greening of urban spaces\u201d is a priority, particularly with housing and broader building targets increasing.   \nThe value, in economic and social wellbeing terms, of urban greening is incontrovertible. Natural England, a government advisory body, shows how city parks, community gardens, playing fields and other urban sites were the most visited type of green space in England. Indeed, living within 100 metres of such an area can raise house prices by an average of \u00a32,500. \n\nResearch has long demonstrated the immense potential of scaling up innovative urban greening within our cities. Public health experts estimate that green social prescribing \u2013 which the NHS defines as encouraging people to spend time in nature to improve physical and mental health \u2013 could save up to \u00a3300 million and lead to 4.5 million fewer GP appointments each year in England alone. \nUrban greening could also help to meet urban food demands. A 2020 study in New York showed that rooftop farming could supply 38% of the city\u2019s leafy green needs. \nGreen developments\nIn the UK, legislation to boost the country\u2019s biodiversity was introduced in early 2024. This aims to enhance the natural habitat of new developments by ensuring that they contribute to a minimum 10% uplift in terms of the quality of the local natural habitat.  \nOur research shows this could really make a difference. New-build estates in and around urban agglomerations are often characterised by large areas of hard landscaping and a lack of creative design around their environmental features. \n\nThe new legislation should ensure a change in landscaping practices. Instead of expanses of impermeable hard surfaces, architects could opt for permeable vegetated surfaces, that could still take the weight of parked vehicles. Green roofs could be encouraged on flat-roofed structures, such as garages or common areas. Timber, concrete and wooden fences could be replaced by hedges using native species.\nHealthy hedgerows can provide shelter for wildlife. They protect the soil and contribute to flood control. Ambitious developers may even consider using native species, including productive edible hedges with sloes, elders, damsons, apples and similar species.\nCommunity orchards are another creative way to improve the green spaces new-build developments provide. A range of organisations already champion this approach. City of Trees in Greater Manchester, has created more than 141 orchards, planted 1,612 street trees and enabled 6,009 metres of hedgerow. \nWith the general election underway, all parties are backing the need for more housing. The Local Government Association argues that England alone needs 250,000 more houses a year, more than double the 130,000 currently being built. The National Housing Federation, meanwhile, says that\u2019s nowhere near enough \u2013 it argues the target should be closer to 340,000. \n\nBut it\u2019s not just numbers that count. The push towards sustainability has meant places including Birmingham and Manchester are seeing a return to high-rise towers. Landscaping and food growing have been an afterthought. \nCity residents need their leaders to think creatively about both the nature of the new housing (building types, estate layouts and densities) and where it\u2019s located. There are plenty of green champions to emulate, including Social Farms & Gardens, with its support for city farming and community growing at a national level, to Sow the City which works with housing providers and others to enable creative greening. The National Trust\u2019s Castlefield Viaduct project in Manchester is a prime example of how even ageing industrial assets can be transformed into havens for nature. \nHousing developments last for decades. The garden cities of a century ago are now mature, green, pleasant and high-value places. If today\u2019s new developments don\u2019t follow suit, they run the clear risk of becoming the slums of the future.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Architecture, Wellbeing, Urban planning, Urban farming, Green space, Social housing, UK housing, Urban greening, Social prescribing, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

In my research and teaching, I have seen that students in fact want to have difficult conversations across divides, but they need support from faculty and other facilitators in order for these discussions to go well. \nSince early 2017, I have been observing events on college campuses in which students are brought together with peers with whom they disagree to talk about politics. In these sessions, facilitators provide students with guiding questions that help them to understand their peers\u2019 political views. \nI conducted follow-up interviews with students a few weeks afterward and, when possible, three years later.\nMy aim is to understand what happens in these conversations. I want to know: Who learns what from whom? Who feels satisfied or frustrated, and why? And what does this all portend for America\u2019s democracy?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe conversations I observed have taught me that six practices help to support a better experience for all students.\n1. Set norms and expectations\nWhen people talk about setting norms for conversation, they usually assume it is an effort to mandate speech rules. But norm-setting accomplishes something better than rule-following: It allows students to become sensitive to their own and others\u2019 hopes and fears for the conversation. \nIn my experience, opening the session with questions such as \u201cWhat do you most hope will happen in this conversation?\u201d \u201cWhat worries you most about the conversation?\u201d \u201cWhat are you willing to give to it?\u201d and \u201cWhat do you hope to get from it?\u201d can show students that they already share more than they anticipate. \nMoreover, this discussion leads naturally into the question of \u201cHow can we interact in a way that is most likely to realize our aims?\u201d Students typically volunteer their own guidelines, such as assuming good faith, objecting to a person\u2019s idea rather than attacking the person, honestly conveying when and why they feel hurt, and listening generously.\n2. Allow students to tell their personal stories\nBeginning with students\u2019 personal stories lowers the barriers to entry, so that students who are not experts on politics can contribute. It allows students to feel heard about their direct experience. And it allows for what I have found to be the most profound outcome of dialogue: the shifts in how students feel about each other.  \nFor example, consider the \u201cCan We Talk\u201d campus dialogue series, which brings together ideologically diverse students for two-hour sessions in which facilitators provide a series of questions for students to ask each other. The sessions began with questions such as, \u201cHow were politics discussed in the home in which you were raised?\u201d and \u201cWhat is your earliest political memory?\u201d before moving on to questions about students\u2019 substantive views on relevant issues.\nThe focus of these sessions, which I observed in the 2017-2018 academic year at colleges throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, is on cultivating students\u2019 understanding of each other\u2019s views and how they came to be.\n\nIf the dialogue is intended to focus on a specific issue, such as gun control, abortion or the war in Israel and Gaza, questions can be geared accordingly, such as \u201cWhen did you first learn about this issue?\u201d \u201cHow did it affect you at the time?\u201d or \u201cWhat about this issue draws you to this conversation?\u201d \n3. Encourage curiosity\nStudents are often afraid that they will end up validating views they oppose unless they try to discredit those views. But in follow-up interviews I conducted three years after  their participation in a dialogue session,  I found that those students who did eventually change their political views were prompted to do so through sincere and nonthreatening questions. \u201cI remember one girl asked me, \u2018If you say you believe this, then why did you vote like that?\u2019 I\u2019ve been asking myself that question ever since,\u201d admitted one student, whose politics changed considerably in the years between our first and second interviews. It mattered most that she felt questioned, not attacked. \nQuestions can be encouraged throughout a conversation by reserving specific time for them in each round, as well as through directions such as \u201cThink of one question you have always wanted to ask someone who thinks differently than you about this issue. Ask it now.\u201d \n4. Dig into disagreement\nOne risk of emphasizing personal experience at the start is that students hesitate to dig into their disagreements. They want to be supportive, and it\u2019s hard to argue with personal experience. In my research, though, I found that students ended up with the deepest respect for each other when they gained understanding of the nature of their disagreements.\nClarifying what is at stake in their differences allowed students to see that their opposition was not caused by ignorance, malice or madness on the other side, but legitimate contrasts in views of what is good and possible. \nAfter students have shared their views on issues and asked each other curiosity-oriented questions, they can be directed to ask each other questions such as \u201cWhat is at the root of our disagreement?\u201d and \u201cWhat really matters to me, and to you, and is it the same thing? To the extent that it is not, why not?\u201d \n\n5. Collaborate on next steps\nStudents tend to feel most satisfied when they can work toward a more concrete aim. Most ambitiously, this can involve real cooperative projects.\nFor example, the Sorenson Institute,  a political leadership institute at the University of Virginia, convenes dialogues that conclude with students putting together a proposal for the Virginia state Legislature on a specific topic such as gun control.\nEven one-off conversations can conclude with what students might do differently on social media, on their campuses and in their families. When I followed up with them, I learned that many students had enacted these changes and found that people changed their own behavior in response. One student found that her uncle started reading and thinking about the articles she would send him. Another student discovered that peers in her political science class who had been dismissive of her in the past became respectful when she expressed her views and seemed to attend to them more sincerely.\n6. Debrief\nSome students will flourish in these conversations, while others will struggle. In my research, I found that students whose rights are threatened by policy proposals of the other side understandably experience the most difficulty. However, these same students\u2019 experiences can be improved by debriefing with a trusted mentor afterward.\nFor example, one student who identifies as queer felt shaken after a discussion with peers who opposed her marriage rights. But meeting with a professor afterward helped her to feel empowered by the conversation, equipped with new knowledge to help her fight for a more just society. \nListening to protest\nDialogue can deepen divides when it is presented as the only appropriate form of political communication, thereby silencing people who do not participate in these conversations. Students should be encouraged to also listen to messages conveyed through other means. For example, they can study protest movements \u2013 including ongoing, contemporary movements \u2013 and read the texts posted by activists who organize them.\nIt is important to convey to students that dialogue alone cannot solve all of what ails contemporary democracy. Protest, boycott and other forms of collective action matter, too.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Politics, US higher education, College students, Dialogue, Political divide, Higher ed attainment, Political dialogue","role":"assistant"}]}

Sigma has another 400.\nYet the law limits owners to just a handful of pharmacies per state. Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria allow just five, Western Australia and Tasmania allow four, and South Australia allows six.\nThe two families that control Chemist Warehouse initially enlisted spouses and cousins to run individual outlets. Once they ran out of relatives who were registered pharmacists and eligible to own pharmacies, they signed up franchisees using contracts that appear to give their head office a fair amount of control.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission describes its influence over franchised stores as \u201clikely particularly strong\u201d.\nLarge conglomerates\nIf you don\u2019t see that many Chemist Warehouse stores as you walk around each day, and you see even fewer Sigma, that could be because of the different storefront names they use, such as MyChemist, Amcal, Discount Drug Store and PharmaSave.\n\nChemist Warehouse isn\u2019t even Australia\u2019s biggest pharmacy group. That\u2019s EBOS, which runs brands including Terry White, healthSAVE, Cincotta Discount Chemist, Mega Save Chemist, Max Value Pharmacy, BetterBuy Pharmacy,  MyMedical Pharmacy and Good Price Pharmacy Warehouse. \nAnd true competition is even harder to find than the presence of these conglomerates suggests.\nWhat matters for genuine competition is who owns the chemists nearby.\nWhen an independent inquiry examined pharmacy remuneration and regulation in 2017 it found instance after instance of all of the pharmacies in a town being owned by the same group, even where the branding was different and they seemed to be competing.\nIn Alice Springs all four were owned by the same group; in Karratha both were; in Broome it was three out of the four.\n\u201cWe turned up to the first and said we were going to the next one afterwards,\u201d the inquiry\u2019s chair Stephen King said at the time. \u201cThey said: Why are you doing that? We own that one as well.\u201d\n\u2018Location rules\u2019 keep out competition\nStores owned by a single owner are unlikely to compete on service, hours or price. \nAnd bizarrely complicated location rules agreed to by the government and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia make it all but impossible for a new owner to come into a suburb or town and seriously compete.\nIt\u2019d be taking a risk to summarise the rules (the handbook runs to 62 pages) but they broadly prevent a pharmacy that wants to fill prescriptions from setting up within 200 metres, 1.5 kilometres or 10 kilometres of an existing pharmacy, depending on whether it\u2019s in a shopping centre, suburb or town.\nIf a competitor can\u2019t come in and all the pharmacies in a particular location don\u2019t compete, there\u2019s little reason to expect them to discount. And most don\u2019t, even though for the past eight years they have been able to.\nDiscounts rare\nBack when King produced his report and the government paid pharmacies an average of A$11.50 per prescription, King\u2019s team reckoned their actual average dispensing costs were lower, for some as low as $7 per prescription. \nSo the health minister Sussan Ley allowed pharmacies to discount, passing on some of the fat to their customers, but only up to $1 per prescription.\nChemist Warehouse pharmacies discounted by the full dollar. Few others did.\n(In New Zealand, where unlimited discounts are allowed, and the legislated payment per patient was NZ$5, Chemist Warehouse discounted prescriptions by the full $5, offering customers prescriptions for free.)\nThe Pharmacy Guild was unhappy about the right to discount and lobbied the government to phase it out, something it did in this year\u2019s May budget.\nRipe for an \u2018Uber\u2019 moment\nThe peculiar rules governing pharmacies ought to make them particularly profitable, except that they don\u2019t, because pharmacies cost so much to buy. The benefit is baked into the price. King calls it the \u201ctaxi licence\u201d phenomenon. The owners who sell get rich as a result of the rules, not the owners who buy.\nWhich gives new owners an even greater incentive to keep startups out.\nAustralia produces 1,400 pharmacy graduates a year. Many would like to own pharmacies and to offer discounts. Most will never get the chance. They are wage slaves, and they want the rules changed.\nThat\u2019s how it was for years with taxis. The price of rides was high and the service was limited because of rules that choked competition. Until Uber.\nAll that needs to happen for pharmacies to face their own Uber moment is a change in the rules to allow unlimited discounting. The government could do it now if it wasn\u2019t worried about a backlash from existing owners.\nAll it would then take would be one registered pharmacy developing a really good interface with nationwide near-instant delivery.\nMachines can dispense medicines\n\nA few years ago the Productivity Commission recommended the government move away from pharmacies as the vehicle for dispensing medicines and trial machines   supervised by qualified staff. \nThey are ubiquitous in Canada. An Australian study found they work well within hospitals.\nThere would still be a role for pharmacists, but in primary health care, doing some of the work doctors now do.\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is wary about the proposed merger of Chemist Warehouse and Sigma Healthcare.\nIt says this is in part because they are also wholesalers and the combined group would have access to inside information on the pharmacists not in the group it supplied medicines to. It\u2019ll decide by September.\nOther decisions will matter more for service and prices. They concern discounting and location rules, and they\u2019ll involve taking on existing owners.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Pharmacies, Community Pharmacy Agreement, chemist warehouse","role":"assistant"}]}

But  social media has become a powerful tool for sportswomen and women\u2019s sport to control their narratives and connect directly with fans. \nThis has sparked debate among communication experts about whether men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams within the same sport, or even the same club or international side, should have separate social media accounts.\nEngland Rugby is the latest team to split the social media accounts of their men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams. Earlier this year, the governing body established dedicated Instagram and X (formerly Twitter) accounts for the Red Roses, the national women\u2019s teams.  \nThe decision by England Rugby follows the Football Association\u2019s move a little over a decade ago to create a distinct brand for England women\u2019s team, the Lionesses. Some researchers have argued that referring to the team solely as \u201cEngland women\u201d reinforces the notion that the men\u2019s team is the default, or the standard. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lionesses moniker, with its connotations of strength and fearlessness, carves out a distinct identity for the women\u2019s side.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why does the FA give the Lionesses less social media support than England's men? It needs to up its game for the Women\u2019s World Cup\n\n\n\n\nTraditionally, women\u2019s sporting achievements have been either ignored or problematically portrayed. Sports sociologist Toni Bruce has highlighted how women have been positioned as \u201cthe other\u201d in media narratives meaning they\u2019re different or separate from the default of the men\u2019s teams. \nBut there are also arguments that traditional coverage for women\u2019s sport is evolving, with a gradual increase in both quantity and quality.\nSocial media holds particular importance for women\u2019s sports due to historical shortcomings. Decades of unequal coverage has prompted female athletes and teams to leverage social media. These platforms have helped foster greater visibility and reach for sportswomen, potentially leading to increased viewership for women\u2019s sports.\nShared or separate accounts?\nProponents of shared accounts argue for a unified team identity. But questions remain over content parity. Shared accounts often raise questions about gender disparity, where women\u2019s content is crowded out by men\u2019s. \nFor example, England Cricket at present only have one account to represent all of their teams. In 2018, Manchester City opted to merge their social media accounts during their The Same City, Same Passion campaign. At the time, the team noted the importance of a shared platform to harness visibility for women\u2019s sport. But now they are using two separate accounts for Man City and Man City Women. \nThe argument for separate social media accounts for men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams in the same sport is that it allows for a more targeted approach to engagement and content creation. But this comes with challenges because rebuilding a dedicated following and social media engagement from scratch take time, effort and resources.\nSome notable examples of teams that have separate social media accounts include the USA women\u2019s soccer team (USAWNT) and the Australian women\u2019s cricket team. \nThe case of USAWNT is particularly interesting. Media scholar Roxanne Coche has explored how the US federation presented the women\u2019s team in comparison to the men\u2019s team on X. She found that by using one account for both teams, the women were treated as a \u201cniche\u201d product while the men\u2019s side received more coverage. \nSince splitting accounts, the USAWNT have amassed 2 million followers on Instagram and 2.4 million followers on X. While the men\u2019s account has 2.3 million followers on X and three million on Instagram. \nThe debate among experts is over whether separate accounts lead to a lack of exposure and visibility for the women\u2019s teams, as they may not have the same reach as the men\u2019s teams. On the other hand, having separate accounts reinforces the notion that men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports are separate entities, rather than being part of the same nation, team and sporting landscape. \nIt appears that it is women\u2019s teams which mostly have to create new platforms rather than the men\u2019s. This reinforces the idea that men are the established group, while women are positioned as outsiders. Consequently, increasing the media work required by women creates an additional gendered burden. \n\nRed Roses\nWe kept track of the amount of social media followers the Red Roses England rugby team had before and after the 2024 Six Nations Championship. England Rugby had been the main account, with 1.3 million followers on Instagram and 1.1 million on X. \nOne week before the start of the tournament, the Red Roses had 14,100 followers on Instagram and 2,600 followers on X. After the Six Nations had ended, the Red Roses had amassed 29,600 followers on Instagram and 5,200 followers on X. \nThis demonstrates how tournaments are heightened periods of visibility. Splitting the account during this time was useful for the Red Roses. But it also demonstrates the huge disparity in the quantity of followers, subsequent visibility, and the time it takes to grow an online fan base. \nThe effect of separate social media accounts extends beyond follower numbers. A dedicated platform allows teams like the Red Roses to take centre stage, freer to find an audience beyond a mere bolt on for men\u2019s content. This focus can foster  a stronger brand identity and deeper fan connections, potentially leading to more positive long-term outcomes for women\u2019s sports.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Social media, Sport, Football, Rugby, Equality, Instagram, Gender equality, Manchester City, Women's football, Women's sport, Lionesses, England cricket team, Women's rugby, Football Association, Social media role, Women's sports, Social media use, Social media trends, Give me perspective, Keep me on trend, X (formerly Twitter)","role":"assistant"}]}

Financial constraints, a post-COVID hangover and sweeping staff layoffs have all made for testing times in the tertiary world.\nSo the government\u2019s appointment of a University Advisory Group to \u201cconsider challenges and opportunities for improvement in the university sector\u201d is more than timely. \nThe group is charged with assessing the financial challenges facing universities, their overall performance, and whether different funding models would help achieve better outcomes.\nPublic submissions have now closed. It will be fascinating to see the answers to the first and perhaps most important question on the submissions form: \u201cWhat should be the primary functions of universities for a contemporary world?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is, of course, no single definitive answer. But there are several working definitions that might help. These often overlap and are sometimes contradictory. The challenge will be to find the right balance between the seven outlined below.\n1. Driver of economic and social development\nThis is a common understanding of a university\u2019s role: as well as teaching the next generation of professionals, university research drives technological development and economic growth.\nFor example, the foundation of Canterbury College (later to become the university) was informed by the economic and social needs of a newly established colonial settlement. This role is compatible with an understanding of the university as a job factory (see below).\nGovernments regularly provide funding to universities to meet training and employment goals, such as the current plan to fund a new medical school at Waikato University.\n2. Promoter of equity\nThe motto of Waikato University \u2013 Ko Te Tangata (For the People) \u2013 clearly states what (or who) a university is for. It offers employment opportunities that should not be restricted to a small minority. \nWhile you are still ten times more likely to go to university if your parents also went to university, over the second half of the 20th century New Zealand radically increased participation in university education. \nIn turn, however, allowing more students to enrol has raised concerns about the risk of lowering academic and teaching standards.\n\n3. Profit-making business\nWith a 20% decline in government funding since 2012, universities have been forced to act as businesses. Shifting to a user-pays funding model means they are selling a product (education) to individual consumers (students). \nFurthermore, free market reforms in the 1980s and 1990s largely deregulated tertiary education. This left universities competing with each other in a marketplace. \nThe importance of university rankings, student recruitment marketing and student experience all flow from this business model. This aligns with another possible function of the university as preserving status and privilege (see below). \nCertain institutions and degrees have always been markers of status for those who can afford them. This perception clearly underpins some arguments against taxpayer funding.\n4. Job factory\nAnother stated purpose of the university is that it exists to reduce unemployment by training people for work (or at least removing them from unemployment statistics while they study). \nA university\u2019s success is measured by how employable its graduates are. This then feeds into criticism of certain degrees (usually in the \u201csofter\u201d humanities subjects) producing \u201cunemployable\u201d graduates. \nThis view dovetails in some ways with the understanding of universities as drivers of national development (see below).\n5. Incubator of intellectual inquiry and knowledge\nAccording to the Education Act 1998:\n\na university is characterised by a wide diversity of teaching and research, especially at a higher level, that maintains, advances, disseminates, and assists the application of, knowledge, develops intellectual independence, and promotes community learning [\u2026]\n\n\nA university fulfils this role through valuable research, free intellectual debate and the creation of good citizens. This purpose can be seen to be threatened by the shift towards the business or job factory models (see above). \nThis view of the university\u2019s function also conflicts with the view they should be drivers of economic and social development (see above), which goes back to the country\u2019s colonial origins. \nIn the words of John Macmillan Brown, one of three founding professors of Canterbury College:\n\nGod help me, what would be the good of Greek verse for pioneers in a new colony?\n\n6. Preserver of status and privilege\nElite universities have always offered their graduates enhanced social connections and employment opportunities. They increasingly cloak their status (justifiably or not) in the language of educational meritocracy, measured in university rankings and successful alumni.\nTheir advertised role as incubators of intellectual inquiry and knowledge complements their other identities as job factory and for-profit business because only the wealthiest customers can afford the products they are selling. \nBut this is clearly in direct conflict with the understanding of universities as promoters of equity.\n7. Social critic and instigator of revolutionary change\nThere is a long history of universities filling the role of \u201ccritic and conscience of society\u201d, which generally complements those of promoter of equity and incubator of intellectual inquiry and knowledge.\nAt the same time, criticisms of universities as elitist ivory towers also have a long history. \nNonetheless, instigating social change extends beyond campus protests and \u201cculture wars\u201d to include research, social commentary and revolutionary technological developments such as the internet and artificial intelligence.\nFinally, all universities have to balance some or all of these purposes, whether complementary or contradictory. The answer to the University Advisory Group\u2019s first question is not straightforward. Any useful answer lies in some mix of these various options.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Universities, University students, University rankings, University funding, Elite universities","role":"assistant"}]}

Conservative candidate Boris Johnson harnessed the widespread pro-Brexit sentiment and capitalised on how the Labour Party had been weakened under Jeremy Corbyn to storm to victory.  \nJohnson owed his win as much to turning to northern, traditionally Labour seats (in what has now become known as the \u201cred wall\u201d) as to the Conservatives\u2019 tradiitonal southern heartlands. Bolstered by this newfound political strength in northern England, Johnson dubbed his flagship policy \u201clevelling up\u201d.  \nFew policy areas have truly cut through into the British public consciousness like the north-south divide has. This socioeconomic gap pitting London and the south of England against the more economically challenged north emerged during the Great Depression of the 1930s, with George Orwell, one of the first to identify it in his 1937 book, The Road to Wigan Pier. \n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts? Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we\u2019ll fact check the claims being made.Sign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernments have tried to address regional inequality ever since, with such questionable success. In my own research, I have likened the north-south divide to England\u2019s equivalent of the Gordian knot. This legend, from the times of Alexander the Great, told of a problem so intractable that only a jarring solution could solve it. Alexander slashed the knot in two with his sword. To date, however, successive British politicians have failed to locate their sword. \nWith levelling up, Johnson might have appeared to be bucking that trend, on being elected in 2019. But two years on from his departure from office, the Labour party is poised to cancel the programme altogether should it win on July 4. The question, then, is what could replace it. \nA post-Brexit policy\nThe Cameron government\u2019s equivalent to levelling up was the northern powerhouse, which focused on the development of the north in general. Although rhetorically similar, Johnson\u2019s levelling up policy aimed to expand powers away from the cities and towards the rest of the country. \nLevelling up was inextricably tied to the post-Brexit environment. It sought to remedy the perceived revolt, espoused by the Leave campaign, against years of city-focused policy. \nRather than simply addressing north-south divisions, Johnson\u2019s rhetoric focused on levelling up all places. His policy, meanwhile, spoke of focusing on the places specifically affected by Brexit. This predominately meant towns.  \n\nFurther, following the UK\u2019s departure from the EU, the government was set to be faced with a massive funding gap previously filled by the European structural funds, amounting to nearly \u00a310 billion.\nJohnsons\u2019s solution was to devise three funds: the towns fund (worth \u00a33.6 billion), the shared prosperity fund (eventually worth \u00a32.6 billion), and the levelling up fund (worth \u00a34.8 billion). The towns fund focused exclusively on England, as did, initially, the levelling up fund until pressure from the devolved governments forced a U-turn.\nIn practice however, as research has shown, these monies did not reach the places of most need. In Wales, the shared prosperity fund yearly allocation of \u00a330 million was only 8% of what the nation had previously received through EU funding. This prompted the then finance minister, Vaughan Gething, to say that Wales now had \u201cless say over less money\u201d.  \nElsewhere, news reports showed that in the first allocation of towns fund money, 39 of the 45 towns were in Conservative-held areas, amid allegations that ministers had ignored civil service advice in order to fund low-priority areas.  \n\nMy colleague Olivier Sykes and I have shown that the towns fund also overlooked seemingly obvious recipients, including Blackpool and Stoke-on-Trent, two of the most deprived local authorities in England.\nOur research has shown that the shared prosperity fund was distributed in similarly unequal ways. Here, every local authority was allocated a rank (tier 1, 2 or 3) roughly corresponding to decreasing levels of priority.  \nWhile 18 of the 20 most deprived local authorities were allocated tier 1 status, we found that other much less deprived areas (including High Peak, Richmondshire and Derbyshire Dales) were also awarded the same tier 1 status. At the same time, deprived areas including Hackney, Salford and Tower Hamlets were overlooked for tier 1 status.  \nGoing further, and mirroring the accusations of pork-barrel politics which have surrounded the towns fund, each of those less-deprived areas was held by a Conservative MP. These included Rishi Sunak\u2019s seat of Richmondshire.\nIt is clear, then, that despite a decade of northern powerhouse,  levelling up and post-Brexit funding, the rhetoric has not delivered. The UK remains thoroughly divided, that Gordian knot well and truly fastened. Indeed, the cancellation, since 2021, of both northern spurs of the high-speed rail network, HS2 \u2013 a crucial tool for getting levelling up done \u2013 gives the feeling of a policy moving in reverse, not advancing.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"David Cameron, Boris Johnson, HS2, North-South divide, Northern Powerhouse, levelling up, regional inequality, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Particles of plastic so tiny they cannot be seen with the naked eye have been found almost everywhere, from the oceans\u2019 depths to the mountain tops. They are in the soil, in plants, in animals and they are inside us. The question is: what harm, if any, are they causing?\nWhen plastic trash is dumped in a landfill or the sea, it breaks down, very slowly. Sunlight and waves cause the surface of the plastic to become brittle, and particles are shed into the environment. Collectively known as \u201csmall plastic particles\u201d, they range in size from five millimetres or smaller (microplastics) to less than one-thousandth of a millimetre (nanoplastics). The smallest can only be detected with special scientific instruments.\nIt remains unclear how microplastics and nanoplastics get inside living things, but several entry points have been suggested. For example, they might pass through the gut from food or drink contaminated with small plastic particles. Or they may be breathed in, or absorbed through the skin.\nOur research suggests that, for some animals at least, nanoplastics are bad news. We injected plastic nanoparticles into chicken embryos. We found that the particles travelled quickly in the blood to all tissues, especially the heart, liver and kidneys. They were also excreted by the embryonic kidneys.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed, too, that plastic nanoparticles tend to stick to a certain type of stem cell in the embryo. These cells are essential for the normal development of the nervous system and other structures. Any damage to stem cells could put the development of the embryo in jeopardy. \nWe suspect that the chicken embryo stem cells have substances on their surface, called \u201ccell-adhesion molecules\u201d, which stick to the polystyrene nanoparticles that we used. We are following up this finding, because when nanoplastics stick to cells and get inside them, they can cause cell death and even serious birth defects in chickens and mice. \nSimilar studies cannot, of course, be carried out on people, so it is not yet possible to say what the implications of our animal research are for humans. What we do know is that nanoplastics are found in the blood of human beings, in other bodily fluids and several major organs and key body tissues.\nIn recent years, microplastics and nanoplastics have been found in the brains, hearts and lungs of humans. They have been discovered in the arteries of people with arterial disease, suggesting they may be a potential risk factor for cardiovascular disease. And they have been detected in breast milk, the placenta and, most recently, penises. \n\nChinese researchers reported earlier this year that they had found microplastics in human and dog testes. More recently, another Chinese team found microplastics in all 40 samples of human semen they tested. This follows an Italian study that found microplastics in six out of ten samples of human semen.\nOur fear is that microplastics and nanoplastics might act in a similar way to deadly asbestos fibres. Like asbestos, they are not broken down in the body and can be taken up into cells, killing them and then being released to damage yet more cells.\nReassuring, for now\nBut there is a need for caution here. There is no evidence that nanoplastics can cross the placenta and get into the human embryo. \nAlso, even if nanoplastics do cross the placenta, and in sufficient numbers to damage the embryo, we would expect to have seen a big increase in abnormal pregnancies in recent years. That is because the problem of plastic waste in the environment has been growing enormously over the years. But we are not aware of any evidence of a corresponding, large increase in birth defects or miscarriages. \nThat, for now, is reassuring. \nIt may be that microplastics and nanoplastics, if they do cause harm to our bodies, do so in a subtle way that we have not yet detected. Whatever the case, scientists are working hard to discover what the risks might be. \nOne promising avenue of research would involve the use of human placental tissue grown in the laboratory. Special artificial placenta tissues, called \u201ctrophoblast organoids\u201d, have been developed for studying how harmful substances cross the placenta.\nResearchers are also investigating potentially beneficial uses for nanoplastics. Although they are not yet licensed for clinical use, the idea is that they could be used to deliver drugs to specific body tissues that need them. Cancer cells could, in this way, be targeted for destruction without damaging other healthy tissue. \nWhatever the outcome of nanoplastics research, we and many other scientists will continue trying to find out what nanoplastics are doing to ourselves and the environment.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Plastic, Stem cells, Microplastics, Environmental pollution, Nanoplastic, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Today there are 189 women out of 557 members of parliament. \nBut women politicians in Uganda continue to be restricted to minority representation. They are constantly battling stereotypes that seek to maintain the status quo of male dominance in political spaces. The electorate has additionally grown accustomed to believing that since women have seats reserved for them, they should stay out of the race for open seats.\nOne of the reasons for this continued marginalisation is that the country\u2019s political parties have done little to empower women. Yet they are the first hurdle that women politicians have to clear, not only to get into parliament but to become effective.\nThe reality is that political party affiliation provides one of the most viable avenues for women\u2019s entry into politics \u2013 the alternative would be to vie as an independent candidates with no affiliation to a political party. Party support provides the much-needed financial resources for successful campaigning that women are normally unable to access. Political parties therefore act as gatekeepers by determining who gets into political office. \n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, women \u2013 like men \u2013 will tend to gravitate towards a party that can provide the financial resources needed to campaign and get into office. In Uganda, this tends to be the National Resistance Movement. The ruling party has been in power for over 30 years, and because of its popularity and apparent control of state resources, it presents the most viable path to parliament. \nI am a scholar of parliamentary politics in Uganda, with a focus on women\u2019s participation. In a recent paper, I set out to study the country\u2019s political parties to identify women\u2019s place in them. I examined the power structures of six of the 26 registered political parties using their documents, such as constitutions, that showed the party structures. I studied the National Resistance Movement, Democratic Party, Forum for Democratic Change, Alliance for National Transformation, Uganda People\u2019s Congress and the National Unity Platform. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Tanzania\u2019s political parties have few women in leadership and candidate lists: some solutions\n\n\n\n\nMy findings show that political parties have a long way to go to improve the position of women in their ranks. While most political party constitutions have a 40% minimum quota for women\u2019s representation in their formal structure, none has  made good on this commitment in the nearly two decades that Uganda has been a multiparty state. My study found that women\u2019s representation averaged 30% and below. \nI also found that Uganda\u2019s multiparty arrangement has tokenised women in the political system. Women\u2019s presence in political parties is meant to depict a semblance of gender equality. However, there is limited commitment to ensuring that barriers against women\u2019s effective political participation are addressed. This significantly \u201cothers\u201d women, rather than granting them active participation.\nFor instance, in Uganda\u2019s 2006 election \u2013 the first under the country\u2019s new multiparty dispensation \u2013 the National Resistance Movement, the ruling party, politicised the quota system on the campaign trail. Its leaders emphasised that women owed the party gratitude for helping to increase their involvement in parliamentary politics. \nIn my view this propagated women\u2019s dependency on the regime and painted them as victims of patronage.\nInbuilt inequality\nIn political parties, unequal gender relations are visible in their structures and processes. The tasks and positions meant for men and women are different. There is a division of labour, with the position of party president, for instance, often the preserve of men, while women deputise them.\nIn the National Resistance Movement, the second vice-chairperson has always been a woman. The party\u2019s overall structure, however, largely remains gendered and focused on men. In its central executive committee, for instance, there is only one woman out of nine members.  \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Burundi\u2019s quota for women in politics has had mixed results, but that\u2019s no reason to scrap it\n\n\n\n\nParty structures also reinforce traditional belief systems when it comes to the acceptable behaviour of a politician. Women\u2019s leagues or wings that are meant to advance women\u2019s political participation and advocate for women\u2019s issues within the party are often used for care or social issues. \nThe Ugandan case exemplifies the secondary status of women in political parties. \nAcross my survey, while women\u2019s leagues were provided for in the party structures, their duties and rights were not elaborated on. In most cases, their activities were managed and approved by the party executive. They were mainly used for logistical support and to mobilise the women constituency during campaigns. And in cases where party leaders meet only quarterly or twice a year, it\u2019s unlikely they would have the time to thoroughly interrogate, or even include, women\u2019s issues on the agenda.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Parliament, Democracy, Uganda, Patriarchy, Yoweri Museveni, Peace and Security, political parties in Africa, National Resistance Movement, Bobi Wine, National Unity Platform (NUP)","role":"assistant"}]}

The move came on the same day that Norway, Spain and Ireland announced that they will recognise a Palestinian state. \nThese funds constitute between 60% and 65% of the Palestinian public budget. Withholding them will have a devastating effect both on a Palestinian government already in financial crisis and on the lives of the Palestinian people.\nThis is not the first time Israel has withheld funds that provide basic goods and services to people in the West Bank and Gaza. Israel has used this tool six times since the peace accords of the 1990s, when it began collecting tax on behalf of the Palestinian Authority. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Norway, Ireland, Spain recognise Palestinian statehood: what this means for Middle East peace \u2013 expert Q&A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first episode occurred in 1997 on account of violence between settlers and Palestinian people in the West Bank. The EU had to step in to cover the Palestinian Authority\u2019s operational expenditures, and the US eventually pressured Israel to transfer the revenues later that year to maintain peace negotiations. \nThen, in 2000, Palestinians staged a major uprising against Israeli occupation, known as the Al-Aqsa intifada (or the the second intifada). Israel accused the Palestinian government of financing terrorist activities during the uprising. Despite the fact that no evidence was found to support the allegations, Israel withheld tax revenues again, this time for two years \u2013 the longest period it has ever done so.\nBy 2002, the Palestinian Authority\u2019s revenue had dropped by 79%. And public sector employees, who at the time made up 26% of those working inside the West Bank and Gaza, went without their full wages for the entire period.\nViolence in the Palestinian territories and Israel intensified until 2005. The West Bank and Gaza suffered immense destruction, with the cost of replacing the damaged infrastructure estimated at US$1.7 billion (\u00a31.3 billion). And Israeli forces turned many cities, towns and villages in the West Bank into restricted military zones, placing residents under curfew for days at a time. This together pushed the Palestinian government to the brink of financial collapse.\n\nThe next episode happened in 2006, when Hamas won legislative elections and assumed administrative control of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. From March 2006 to July 2007, Israel withheld tax revenue worth an estimated US$1.1 billion. This froze most government activities, including essential public services in health and education, and caused a dramatic economic downturn. \nUnder the leadership of EU, international donors intervened to provide direct financial support to Palestinians. This included providing social allowances for some unpaid government employees and financial assistance for low-income families. But, at the request of Israel, this financial support bypassed the Palestinian Authority and was channelled through alternative mechanisms.\nIn 2011, Israel suspended tax revenues for one month after the Palestinian Authority applied for recognition of the Palestinian state in the UN General Assembly. And then, in early 2015, Israel withheld tax revenues for a sixth time after the Palestinian Authority applied to join the International Criminal Court.\nBetween 2000 and 2017, the Palestinian Authority sustained US$6.6 billion in losses as a result of the delayed revenue transfers. This was largely due to the loss of interest earned and the borrowing costs of alternative financing. Yet Israel has never compensated the Palestinian Authority for these costs.\nIn addition to withholding revenues, Israel unilaterally deducts bills for electricity, water, health, sewage and court orders before sending a net revenue amount to Palestine. In 2019, for instance, Israel deducted US$43 million from the Palestinian Authority budget: a sum it claimed Palestine had paid to the families of Palestinians who had been jailed or killed as a result of attacking Israel.\nConsequences for Palestinian people\nIsrael is using financial control as a tool of collective punishment against Palestine. It is a strategy that has severely harmed the Palestinian economy and, as a consequence, the wellbeing of its people. \nThe World Bank estimates that 21% of the Palestinian population were already considered poor \u2013 living on just US$2.10 (\u00a31.64) per day \u2013 on the eve of the second intifada. This figure had surged to about 60% by December 2002, two years after Israel suspended the delivery of tax revenue for a second time.\n\nWhen tax revenues are withheld, many Palestinians are forced to reduce their food and educational expenditure, as well as their access to health services. For example, the average daily food consumption of a poor person in the West Bank and Gaza in 1998 was equivalent to US$1.47 per day. This had slipped to US$1.32 by early 2002 \u2013 a direct consequence of Israel withholding tax revenue for two years.\nThe cumulative effect of these suspensions has strangled the Palestinian economy and society, contributing to a cycle of poverty and deprivation. The new announcement will only exacerbate these conditions, worsening the plight of Palestinians in the region.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Tax, Israel, Poverty, Palestine, Gaza, Hamas, West Bank, Palestinian Authority, Tax revenues, financial abuse, Economic crisis, financial support, Second Intifada, Oslo Peace Accords, Bezalel Smotrich, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

It called for diplomatic intervention \u201cto ensure her full and unconditional release without delay\u201d.  \nOn May 21 2024, Zhang released a video  through an intermediary confirming her release in which she said she was staying with her brother in Shanghai. In the video, the former lawyer appeared in her dressing gown looking subdued, possibly ill, and speaking very softly. \n\n\n\n\n\nShe thanked those who had helped and supported her. As the video was filmed in a darkened corridor it is impossible to know if the location is in fact her brother\u2019s apartment.\nIn February 2020, Zhang had travelled to Wuhan where she filmed stories about the scale of the Wuhan lockdown, focusing on empty train stations, hospitals overflowing with patients and the strict limits on freedom of speech concerning the lockdown. \nShe posted these on social media and in one obtained by the BBC, you can see the police stopping her physically from filming. In the video she said: \u201cMaybe I have a rebellious soul. I thought: Why can\u2019t I film these things? I think this is true reality. So why can\u2019t I film the truth?\u201d\nZhang was arrested in May 2020 and was later charged with \u201cpicking quarrels and provoking trouble\u201d, a vaguely worded charge which the Guardian\u2019s senior China correspondent Amy Hawkins says is  standard for activists and elicits a 99% conviction rate. A further three Chinese citizen journalists were understood to have been detained around the same time as Zhang.\nFor reporting during lockdown, the BBC\u2019s John Sudworth was expelled in 2021, along with his wife Yvonne Murray who was the Beijing correspondent for the Irish public broadcaster RT\u00c9. During this period China also expelled correspondents working for the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Australian Financial Review. \nDuring her detention Zhang went on hunger strike and ended up being hospitalised. In one of her hearings, she was brought into court in a wheelchair. According to RSF, she had been force-fed through a nasal tube and was suffering from \u201csevere malnutrition, gastrointestinal disease and low white blood cell count\u201d. \nIn the recently released 2024 RSF World Press Freedom Index, China is ranked 172 out of 180 countries. The index notes that China is \u201cthe world\u2019s largest jailer of journalists\u201d and that 106 journalists and three media workers are currently detained. \n\nWe may never hear from Zhang about the conditions of her detention, but what is known from dual citizen journalists whom Beijing has detained in the past is that the conditions are always harsh. Chinese-Australian business presenter Cheng Lei spent three years in jail in China \u201cfor breaking an embargo by a few minutes\u201d in 2020. \nAfter major diplomatic campaigning, she was released, and was able to speak on her return to Melbourne, where she said her imprisonment was \u201clike being buried alive\u201d. During her detention, her only contact with the outdoors was to have a window opened for fifteen minutes a day.\nAustralian prime minister Anthony Albanese insisted that Cheng\u2019s release was not part of a deal struck with Beijing but that it happened following, \u201cthe completion of judicial processes in China\u201d. This careful wording could be because Chinese-Australian writer and businessman Yang Hengjun, who is accused of spying, remains in detention and is said to be suffering from kidney and other health problems. \nYang has been in jail since 2019, and in February this year a court sentenced him to a suspended death sentence. The International Federation of Journalists said at the time that \u201cYang Hengjun\u2019s sentencing is egregious, and representative of the worst human rights abuses committed by Chinese authorities towards journalists and media workers\u201d. \nGlobal press freedom under threat\nBut it\u2019s not just China which is waging war with journalists. In a general comment about the state of the media, RSF said: \u201cPress freedom around the world is being threatened by the very people who should be its guarantors \u2013 political authorities.\u201d The bottom five countries in the RSF index demonstrate that it is repressive political regimes that are the worst abusers of human rights workers and journalists: Iran, North Korea, Afghanistan, Syria and Eritrea. \nIn Iran, local BBC journalists and their families have been harassed and attacked for many years or have been forced into exile. In April 2024, the BBC World Service \u201cfiled an urgent appeal to the UN over abuse of national security and counter-terrorism laws against BBC News Persian journalists\u201d.  \nMeanwhile, the BBC\u2019s Iranian journalists continue to report on government\u2019s abuses. On May 2 this year, Iran\u2019s judiciary filed charges against \u201ca number of [local] journalists and activists\u201d who had posted comments online following a BBC Eye investigation into the death of teen protester and video activist Nika Shakarami. \nThe activist disappeared in 2022 after reportedly being detained by members of a paramilitary group, and her body was recovered a week later in a mortuary. The judiciary-run Mizan news agency labelled the BBC report, \u201cfake, incorrect and full of mistakes\u201d. It added that the activists who commented on the report were summoned for allegedly \u201cdisrupting the psychological security of society\u201d.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"China, Journalism, Media freedom, Wuhan, COVID-19, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Like everyone else their age, they\u2019re turning into adults. But unlike most of their peers, they also have to start living on their own.\nThey are more likely to experience poverty, unemployment, homelessness and incarceration than other Americans their age.\nUnlike young adults who have stable relationships with their parents or other guardians, young adults aging out of foster care often have to try to figure out basic skills on their own, like how to open a bank account, create a resume, apply for jobs or navigate financial aid forms for college. People leaving foster care are also less likely to graduate from high school.\nWhat\u2019s next\nMy team wants to know more about what kinds of services make the biggest difference in helping young people transition out of foster care. For an upcoming study, we surveyed a larger group of young adults, as well as the staff members of programs serving this community. \nThe Research Brief is a short take about interesting academic work.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Employment, Safety net, Foster care, Quick reads, Speed reads, Young adults, Research Brief","role":"assistant"}]}

This brilliant generation of physicists ultimately peeled back the layers of the universe, as well as of the atom, to reveal a world stranger than fiction.\nEver since those earliest days of quantum mechanics, the theory ruling the microworld of atoms and particles, the holy grail of physics has been finding a theory of everything \u2013 uniting quantum mechanics with Einstein\u2019s theory of general relativity, which applies to the universe on large scales. \nBut we still don\u2019t have a tried and tested theory of everything. And I believe a fear of failure is a big part of the problem. \nCreating a theory of everything isn\u2019t exactly easy. It involves producing one framework uniting the fundamental forces of our universe, while accounting for all the underlying constants and quantities as well as every subatomic particle. The prize for whoever answers this ultimate question is eternal glory in the annals of humankind.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was great hunger to solve it in Einstein\u2019s generation. In fact, Einstein worked on a theory of everything on his very deathbed \u2013 work that he was ultimately ridiculed for. Einstein\u2019s contribution to physics was so great he still remains a superstar. But physicists Arthur Eddington, Hermann Weyl and mathematician David Hilbert were not so fortunate, with some facing much worse consequences. \nTake Eddington, for example, perhaps the greatest scientist you have never heard of. The Cambridge astronomer and physicist proved Einstein correct in his work analysing a 1919 eclipse \u2013 launching Einstein to superstardom. Eddington also wrote the first English books on relativity before doing the same on Georges Lema\u00eetre\u2019s Big Bang theory.\nHe also wrote a book on quantum physics, and became the greatest popular writer on science in the 1920s and 1930s, alongside his groundbreaking work on stellar physics (the physics of stars). Yet he is obscure today due to his intense pursuit of a fundamental theory. \nPublished posthumously, his attempt was immediately banished for its incredible failure. Mocked as numerology (the belief in a mystical relationship between a number and events), his strange interest in the power of certain numbers was made fun of by other scientists. And, as many notable astrophysicists have pointed out, it has produced no value since its publication. \nEddington\u2019s stunning final failure served as a powerful warning of the price that comes with missing the mark. The final decade of his life spent pursuing a theory of everything ended in severe damage to his legacy.\nA new generation\nThe generation of the physicist Richard Feynman (1918\u201388), following that of Einstein and Eddington, lost interest in a theory of everything. Feynman and his peers found their own glory in new subatomic discoveries and theories, and applications of physics to chemistry and biology, leading to several Nobel prizes. The ridicule endured by those who tried and failed before them may have been one of the reasons.\nThis inordinate cost for failure ultimately rose alongside the glory of interwar physics. In a period of unparalleled success, failure was more unforgiving. This was hardly an incentive for young and brilliant modern minds seeking to apply themselves to the largest question.\nEven today, attempts at theories of everything get mocked. String theory, for example, is such an attempt, and has been scorned by Nobel laureate Roger Penrose as not being real science.\nHe is not alone. Physicist Stephen Hawking believed a version of string theory called M-theory was our best option for a theory of everything. But the theory has struggled in producing predictions that can be tested by experiments. \n\nA young scientist today may wonder, if Einsteinx, Eddington and Hawking could not solve the problem, then who will? And indeed, many are doubtful that it can be achieved. Is it even necessary as, pragmatically, we can do without one?\nIt is no wonder, then, that many physicists prefer to avoid the term \u201ctheory of everything\u201d these days, opting instead for less grandiose alternatives such as \u201cquantum gravity\u201d.\nFunding and career progression\nAlongside the heavy price of failure, other problems are lurking. A brilliant young mind could be staring at a career dead end in seeking out a theory of everything. What academic progression can one expect at the start of their career if this is desired? Who will give significant funding to young, unproven researchers pursuing a seemingly impossible goal in the short term?\nIt is likely that a theory of everything will ultimately require massive collaboration to be solved. Ironically, this may be a job for the older physicists, despite the warnings of Eddington and others. Francis Crick dedicated his attention to trying to solve the problem of consciousness in his later years, albeit without success. \nWe need collaboration. But we may be looking at the prospect of a theory of everything only coming from those who have accomplished so much they can afford the potential embarrassment and will be given the benefit of the doubt. This hardly stirs the enthusiasm of the vibrant, young minds that may otherwise tackle the problem.\nIn trying to solve the ultimate problem, we may have inadvertently created a monster. Our academic framework for research progression is not conducive to it, and history has presented an unkind picture of what happens to those who try.\nAnd yet, our greatest progress has always come from those willing to take risks.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Physics, Theory of Everything, Quantum gravity, Albert Einstein, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

This successful self-directed project-based learning approach must be integrated into the school curriculum to support progress towards the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of \u2018Roots & Shoots\u2019\nA global environmental education movement was born in 1991, when a group of 12 distressed teenagers gathered on Goodall\u2019s front porch in Tanzania. The teens shared their concerns for the planet and explained they felt powerless to do anything about it. \nGoodall listened. Together, they exchanged stories and ideas about potential solutions. The group left with a plan of action and \u201creasons for hope\u201d. \nMore than 30 years later, Roots & Shoots is active in more than 60 countries.\nThrough Roots & Shoots, members select a cause they feel strongly about. Then they receive the tools, resources and support they need to develop and carry out their plan of action. \nIn this way, children as young as five can make a difference. Projects range from helping bring back local bird and bee populations, to reforesting derelict plots of urban land, or raising awareness of environmental issues through podcasts and videos. \nDear World \u2013 sharing success stories\nOur new book, Dear World, is a collection of letters from environmental and social justice activists of all ages. \nBoth renowned and unsung activists share their personal stories and offer advice to others who want to create positive change. \nFor example, 13-year-old Spencer Hitchen of Noosa in Queensland was worried about the \u201cWallum ecosystem\u201d of shrubs and grasslands in his \u201cbackyard\u201d at Sunshine Beach.\nHe received a A$250 mini grant from Roots & Shoots Australia to help create a calendar featuring his photography, to raise awareness. \n\nOther Roots & Shoots members are helping bring back local bee populations, raising awareness of \u201camazing animals\u201d through educational videos, and offering earth-friendly lifestyle tips online. \nIt is the unstructured, informal nature of Roots & Shoots activities that make them so successful.\nBut there\u2019s no reason why this model couldn\u2019t work in the classroom. Students could be given the opportunity to conceptualise and implement their own environmental and social justice projects, applying their natural talents and interests to a cause of their choosing. \n\nExpanding the Roots & Shoots model into formal education\nAs our research shows, there\u2019s a strong evidence base for this. The free-choice project-based learning approach can be integrated into the curriculum on sustainable development. This would enable students to solve real-world environmental and social challenges. \nThe students could take part in a project for a single school term or a whole year, in the following way:\n1) select a Sustainable Development Goal and topic of inquiry (such as a specific local environmental or social justice issue) of their choice, based on personal interest and curiosity\n2) conduct self-directed research into potential solutions \n3) tap into the expertise of local community leaders, Indigenous elders, older students, teachers and peers\n4) implement the project and report back to the class about their impact\n5) celebrate their success and learn from each other at a suitable forum, such as an open day or community exhibit. \nTechnology such as multimedia resources, online discussion forums and virtual field trips can also support the curriculum. \nStep-by-step approach to implementing the Roots & Shoots program in the classroom\n\nA lasting legacy\nYoung people will inherit the Earth. Their education must include developing skills to tackle the challenges they will surely face. This goes beyond learning about abstract concepts such as deforestation in the Amazon and climate change in Antarctica. \nNothing beats first-hand experience of developing and implementing practical solutions. Imagine the benefits of restoring a local ecosystem to witness the return of birdlife during the course of their schooling? Or making recycled toys for refuge dogs. \nLast month we celebrated Goodall\u2019s 90th birthday. I can\u2019t think of a better way to honour her evolving legacy than to embed her Roots & Shoots model in our classrooms. It can be so much more than a nice-to-have extracurricular activity, enjoyed by a select few. \nThe author would like to acknowledge fellow Dear World co-editors, Nila Taylor and Benjamin Howes, and the 18 contributors who shared their stories for the book.

It\u2019s a process that has been ongoing over the past few decades and part of a strategy to erode good jobs in the alcohol retail sector. It can be viewed as union-busting by stealth and the public has played its part along the way.\n\n\n\n\n\nCasualization of work\nOnce considered to be good jobs, workers at the Beer Store and Liquor Control Board of Ontario (LCBO) retail outlets have been pressured for years. Employers have forced tiered agreements with unions, where part-time and casual workers earn much less than full-time workers.\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) union representing more than 6,000 beer store workers and the Ontario Public Service Employees Union (OPSEU) representing 8,000 LCBO workers both have agreements that have full-time workers earning almost double part-time and seasonal workers. Today, unionized full-time Beer Store workers earn more than $30 per hour while a part-time workers with four years\u2019 experience earn approximately $17 per hour. \nRetailers have turned to part-time workers to reduce their labour costs and meet public demand to keep stores open during evenings and weekends. This process is known as the casualization of work.\nIn the most recent census, full-time workers \u2014 including management \u2014 in Ontario\u2019s beer, wine and liquor stores made up less than half of the 16,645 workers employed in the sector, but had an average annual income two to three times higher than part-time workers. In the current round of bargaining, OPSEU is demanding protection for permanent jobs in the face of \u201cmarketplace change.\u201d\n\nGeographic shift of retail distribution\nBeyond the casualization of work, the geographic shift of retail distribution is also threatening wages in the sector. \nLCBO convenience outlets, also known as liquor agency stores, are small, non-union, owner-operated businesses attached to corner stores and gas stations. A few agents were established in the 1960s to get alcohol to rural areas, but the program rapidly expanded in the 2000s. Over the last decade, the number of agency stores has doubled to almost 400 locations across the province. \nMore recently, Ontario grocery stores have been allowed to sell beer and wine. In August, more than 450 grocery stores will add ready-to-drink alcohol products to shelves. During the pandemic, grocery and convenience outlet sales exploded. \nAccording to recent annual reports, Ontarians purchase 10 to 15 per cent of their beer, wine and spirits from these agency outlets and grocery stores. The potential addition of more than 8,500 corner stores selling booze is the next big step in decentralizing liquor distribution away from unionized retail locations. \nThe potential loss of government revenue via decentralized distribution may be overstated. After all, wholesale distribution will still be controlled by the Beer Store and the LCBO, and the government is not going to stop taxing. \nReal losses will be in the pocketbooks of beer and liquor workers as work shifts to small, lower wage, non-unionized workplaces. Unions are unlikely to organize chains or small, independent family-run operations, which will lead to further downward pressure on wages across the sector. \nConvenience stores rely upon low-wage work and have lobbied the Ontario government to allow them to sell alcohol in order to meet the increases to the minimum wage rate. \nThe populist appeal\nOther powerful forces driving the geographical expansion distribution are populist calls for booze in rural areas and politicians like Ford, whose \u201cBuck-A-Beer\u201d campaign slogan pledged to lower the minimum price of beer to $1 from $1.25.\nAs historian Craig Heron has noted in his book Booze, Ontario has a long history of prohibition, temperance and disciplining workers through controlling access to alcohol. \nIt\u2019s not surprising that loosening government restrictions on what, where and when people drink has a populist appeal, and populist politicians like Ford know it very well. Beer has long been used as a political tool in Canada.\n\nIt is here where labour unions are trapped. Unions have argued there are economic, social and environmental benefits to having a more centralized system: larger operations are more efficient and can pay higher wages and efficiency, access to alcohol for young people can be more easily restricted, and the recycling and reuse of bottles and cans is facilitated.\nAs unions draw attention to these advantages to protect union jobs, they risk falling into the trap of echoing the moral panics around out-of-control access or stand accused of limiting rural communities\u2019 access to alcohol. \nWhat can unions do?\nUnions do have strategic options. They will continue push back against increased decentralization and casualization, but with the addition of thousands of low-wage alcohol outlets, this is perhaps a lost battle. \nUnions may choose a fortress strategy and protect remaining jobs and wages in distribution centres and remaining stores. A more aggressive strategy will be for unions to focus less on workplaces and organize workers in the sector as an occupation or trade.  \nIn order to first reach these workers, unions could demand a role in the certification and training of all new workers who sell alcohol to the public. From here workers could be mobilized to demand minimum standards for all licensed workers. \nIf good jobs are to remain in the sector, unions will have to be creative and extend their power beyond their stronghold in the retail system to ensure present and future workers in the alcohol sales sector receive fair treatment and compensation.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Labour, Unions, Populism, Alcohol industry, Alcohol use, Ontario, Decentralization, Doug Ford, Labour unions","role":"assistant"}]}

A key question is why it was called then when it did not have to be? The decision to call an election is always a gamble \u2013 there is perhaps no right time \u2013 and many factors feed into that call.\nLegally, a general election had to be called in 2024. Behind the scenes, those in Number 10 will have been modelling when the vote should be held with the help of key economic indicators such as inflation and gross domestic product (GDP), as well as analysing the polls and speaking to focus groups. \nIn the UK, the power to request a dissolution of parliament and call an election lies with the prime minister. The party in power uses a process known as \u201cevidence-based diagnostics\u201d, in which evidence is collected regarding the state of the UK and analysed alongside voter perceptions, in an attempt to identify the best time \u2013 for them \u2013 to call an election. \nThis is complex, as it includes an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of rival parties, and of independent analyses published by organisations such as the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Increasingly, artificial intelligence is applied to sift through these vast amounts of data to spot patterns and make predictions.\n\n\nWant more general election coverage and analysis from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts?\nSign up for our new, weekly UK politics newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nRecently, there has been some very good economic news highlighting that Britain is not as broken as politicians or some journalists might like us to believe. The UK inflation rate in April dropped to 2.3%, and GDP was estimated to have grown by 0.6% in the three months to March 2024.\nThe quest for economic stability\nThese two indicators played an important role in the decision to call a general election for July 4. It may be that, in terms of the economy, this is the best time for the Conservatives to take the fight to the Labour party, especially as Labour\u2019s offer hinges around the promise of economic stability. \nThe UK economy has experienced an early recovery from the technical recession it experienced in the second half of 2023. Household incomes have improved and this is bolstering consumer spending. Some of this reflects alterations that were made in the 2023 Autumn Statement, including the four percentage point reduction in National Insurance contributions paid by employees. \nIn addition, financial markets now assume the Bank of England will begin cutting interest rates in August or September 2024, rather than in June. The anticipated timing of these cuts suggests the government had little to gain by waiting until the autumn to hold this election, because of the lag time between an interest rate cut and its impact.  \nAs such, the Conservative party can claim there is evidence the UK has already reached a time of economic stability that provides a platform for growth. Vote for us, they say, and we\u2019ll build on this work.\nMeanwhile, Labour has unveiled its pledge card with six key policies, including economic stability. These are the six initiatives that its analysis will have identified as being most attractive to voters and party members. \n\nAbove all, Labour is arguing that now is the time for change. But to argue for change by itself is insufficient. Not all change is desirable and change also tends to disrupt, resulting in uncertainty and instability. \nMy experience in evidence-based diagnostics leads me to believe that neither party has made best use of this process in identifying the key challenges the UK faces.\nIn many respects, it is good for countries to experience regular changes in their leadership. Diagnostics to identify the most important challenges to tackle should be central to this, but politics \u2013 that is, the effort to please voters \u2013 will dominate this and many more general elections. There is a tension in all countries between the interests and needs of citizens as identified by the evidence, compared with the desires of politicians to form the next government.\nVoters will hope the next UK government can rise to the challenge and ensure both economic growth and national security. But they might feel more confident if UK political parties looked at policy identification and prioritisation through the same evidence-based lens that informed Rishi Sunak\u2019s choice of July 4 for the election date.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Labour, UK economy, Conservatives, UK elections, UK GDP, Rishi Sunak, Give me perspective, UK inflation","role":"assistant"}]}

This was his response to the news that the UK election would be held on July 4 \u2013 after many Scottish schools have already broken up for the summer, and just as a lot of families will be taking off on holiday. To Swinney (and others), this was just another example of Scotland being an afterthought for Westminster.\nIt may indeed be the case that Scotland was not a major factor in Rishi Sunak\u2019s decision to call a July election. After all, Scotland only returned six Conservative MPs in 2019 (down from 13 in 2017) out of a total of 59. Voters overwhelmingly chose the SNP, which took 45% of the vote and 48 seats, thereby making it the third-largest party in Westminster (again).\nThis has been a pattern since the Scottish independence referendum of 2014, which triggered a political realignment. Ever since, the Scottish electorate appears to have voted according to constitutional preference, rather than making a wider, issues-based consideration. Those who voted for independence supported the SNP in Westminster elections, while those who opposed it mostly backed Labour or the Conservatives. \nBut recent polls suggest this pattern is about to be broken. Scotland, it appears, is headed for huge change.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll indications are that the next parliament will include many more Scottish Labour MPs and many fewer SNP MPs. Indeed, the latest polls indicate the SNP could lose up to 30 seats, with the vast majority going to Scottish Labour, while the Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives could pick up one or two additional seats, respectively. Boundary changes mean Scotland will now have 57 rather than 59 MPs, but that will be little consolation for the SNP. \nSince its 2019 victory, support for the SNP has declined steadily. The political woes of former first minister Nicola Sturgeon and her husband Peter Murrell, followed by her resignation in February 2023, was a rough patch for the party. \nHer successor, Humza Yousaf, after a period of initial calm beset by only minor gaffes, had to resign suddenly after pulling out of the SNP\u2019s governing agreement with the Greens. His replacement as first minister and leader, Swinney, has hardly had time to bed in. He may well have preferred that the election was held later in 2024, enabling him to deal with some of the SNP\u2019s woes in the meantime.\nHowever, we should not automatically assume that the drop in support for the SNP means voters in Scotland no longer care about independence. Support for independence remains at about the same level it was in 2014. What appears to have changed is that people appear to now want to vote with other issues in mind.\nWhile a core of support remains for the SNP on the independence issue, the two most important issues for respondents to a recent poll were the cost of living and the NHS. When asked to highlight the most important three influences on their potential vote, two-thirds focused on the cost of living as an issue, and half on the NHS.\nIn this regard, Scotland seems to be much like the wider UK. Both of these issues rated far ahead of other matters such as independence, climate change, immigration, education or jobs and unemployment \u2013 all of which scored in the teens in terms of how likely they were to influence people\u2019s voting choice.\n\nAs it stands, more people trust Scottish Labour on these core issues than they do the SNP or the Scottish Conservatives. Only on the issue of independence, unsurprisingly, is the SNP stronger than its main competitor. But up to 20% of those who voted SNP in 2019 have indicated they may well support Scottish Labour in July.\n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts?

Over the past decade, the SNP has been the recipient of such support, but party in-fighting, legal woes and the rapid turnover of three leaders have clearly had an impact. \nFaced with a Conservative UK government, voters in Scotland strongly supported the SNP, seeing the nationalist party as the best choice for a voice for Scotland in the UK parliament. That, it seems, is now a changing perception, and support is clearly moving.\nWith Labour the strong favourites to form the next UK government, a number of voters in Scotland, more concerned with the issues of day-to-day living rather than constitutional matters, are backing Scottish Labour. This time, these voters may consider that having more Scottish voices within the UK government, rather than in opposition in Westminster, could be a potential positive for Scotland.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"SNP, Scotland, Scottish National Party, Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour, Scottish Conservatives, John Swinney, Keir Starmer, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

But a few days after the water main break, the city signalled that water use was starting to creep back up, raising concerns that water may run dry.\nAcross Canada, there is a general misconception about the amount of water we use. Recent reports have shown that Canadians use five times more water than they think \u2014 with a real water footprint of around 329 litres per day. \n\n\n\n\n\nCanada is one of the biggest water users among peer nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, ranking sixth out of 34 nations in total water usage, and second in per-capita water use.\nWith increased awareness of our reliance on water, many Canadians may be asking themselves how much water they use and how they can reduce their overall water use. With the continued threat of drought in many parts of the country and continued threats to water supply, there are simple ways in which we, as individuals, can use water more sustainably.\n\nIn the kitchen\nThe biggest water sink in the kitchen are faucets where most people have a tendency to do a cold or hot \u201cflush\u201d at the taps when washing hands or dishes. A hot flush is when you turn on the tap until it gets to your desired temperature. \nWhile energy efficient guidelines limit faucets flow rates to 6.8 litres per minute, even a few minutes can consume a tremendous amount of safe drinking water. At the tap, consider adding a bucket in the sink to catch any unused water before it goes down the drain and reusing it for watering plants, hand-washing and rinsing dishes or for cleaning. To further save water, ensure you are using water-efficient dishwashers and running the dishwasher when it\u2019s full on an eco or short cycle.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How to provide reliable water in a warming world \u2013 these cities are testing small-scale treatment systems and wastewater recycling\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, if possible, try to upgrade your laundry to more efficient machines that use less water, and only run full loads of laundry on low-water cycles to minimize wastage.\nIn the bathroom\nOur bathrooms are important places to reduce water use. In fact, it\u2019s been shown that Canadians spend more than 50 per cent of our water in bathrooms.\nMake sure faucets aren\u2019t leaking and ensure toilet leaks are fixed right away. A simple fix is the addition of low-flow faucets, taps and toilets. Activities that consume the most water in bathrooms are baths, showers, brushing teeth and washing. Turn off the tap while brushing and consider a shower timer that can help keep showers under five minutes \u2014 playing a song in the background with a five-minute run time can be an easy way to know when to get out. \nTurn off the shower while using soap or shampoo, and consider installing aerators on taps that can help give you higher pressure while using less water. Finally, avoid flushing the toilet after every use and remember the old adage \u201cif it\u2019s yellow, let it mellow. If it\u2019s brown, flush it down!\u201d\n\nOutdoors\nOne of the most difficult changes needed in our relationship with water is outside the home as Canadians are often found watering lawns, washing cars and running through sprinklers. \nChoose drought-resistant plants that are acclimatized to your local environment and are appropriate to where you live, choosing Indigenous plant species whenever possible. \nWater plants and grass early in the morning or late at night to minimize evaporation and ensure that more water makes its way to the roots of the plants. Rain barrels are a simple way to collect water to be used for watering your plants, but you can even just use a bucket if you don\u2019t have the capacity to invest in a larger rain collection system. \nDuring times of water restrictions, the first thing to do is eliminate any and all reliance on outdoor water use. Washing your cars can be done more efficiently at a car wash that uses recycled water than at home. However, avoiding washing your car is the best way to go \u2013 wait for rainfall and let nature do the work for you.\nStay aware\nLastly, monitor your use since most Canadians. As Toronto has shown, cities can support residents by making water-use data available in real-time to residents. If your area does not provide this service, then consider petitioning your local government and utilities to pressure them to do so.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Humans are depleting groundwater worldwide, but there are ways to replenish it\n\n\n\n\nTime yourself in the shower and count the seconds you have taps on. For families, turn shower time into a game to use the least amount of water possible and get the whole family involved in water consumption reduction.\nIt may also help to remind yourself that access to (relatively cheap) clean and safe drinking water is a rare luxury that billions of people around the world \u2014 and many right here in Canada \u2014 still do not have equal access to. While such gross inequalities persist, it is both pragmatically sensible and ethically imperative that we all do our best to use our planet\u2019s water responsibly.\nThese simple techniques can help you to be more aware of your water use and can start to create a more sustainable relationship with water, something that we know we cannot live without.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Water, Drought, Canada, Alberta, Water use, Calgary, Freshwater use","role":"assistant"}]}

At the time, Caddick was being investigated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission for alleged financial misconduct, with dozens of people defrauded for millions of dollars.\nThe media\u2019s coverage of her \u201cvanishing act\u201d only heightened public interest in the case. Despite extensive searches, only a single foot enclosed in a running shoe has been found, washed up on a beach in New South Wales.\nThe NSW Coroners Court declared Caddick dead in May 2023 but couldn\u2019t establish the date, cause or manner of death. As part of the investigation, experts consulted work done by myself and colleagues: the only forensic research available on how marine organisms colonise items connected to people, such as shoes and clothing.\nThe research is also now featured in an ITV UK documentary The Missing Millionairess, just aired on Channel 9 in Australia. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Caddick case shows just how tricky marine forensic investigations can be, but also how useful they can be when we have extremely limited evidence.\nA single shoe\nTypically, when a body isn\u2019t immediately found, the case falls in the \u201cmissing persons\u201d category. This classification is often summarised as \u201cno body, no crime\u201d and can cause investigation delays.\nAuthorities have to navigate a web of uncertainties as they work to locate the victim and determine whether foul play was involved.\nThis is further complicated when there\u2019s no physical evidence, such as bloodstains, signs of struggle, or a potential weapon to work with. Physical evidence is usually crucial for reconstructing the events and identifying those potentially involved.   \nAccording to a reconstruction of the events in Caddick\u2019s case, her son reported hearing the front door of their home close in the early morning of November 12 2020. At the time, he assumed his mother had gone for a run, but she was never seen again. \nMonths later, on February 21, Caddick\u2019s shoe with the remains of a decomposing foot inside was discovered on Bournda Beach in NSW. The finding opened a new chapter in the investigation. \nIt\u2019s not uncommon to find connections between washed-up shoes and cases of homicide, accident or suicide. That\u2019s because the materials used to make shoes (particularly sneakers which tend to contain rubber) have buoyant properties.\nA body\u2019s decomposition underwater can lead to the disarticulation (separation at the joint) of various body parts \u2013 especially skulls, hands and feet. Skulls often remain intact and sink to the bottom. Hands consist of about 30 small bones which tend to disperse in the water.  \nFeet, however, are typically well preserved if they\u2019re enclosed within shoes. They often hold together and can be transported over long distances as the shoe floats. Over time, the fatty tissue within turns into a waxy substance called adipocere.\n\nWhat can we find out from such limited remains?\nWhen remains such as a single limb are discovered, investigators will promptly try to confirm the victim\u2019s identity through DNA analysis. In Caddick\u2019s case, a DNA profile provided conclusive evidence the remains belonged to her.\nAs for investigating whether the bones were disarticulated or deliberately separated from the rest of the body, this is work for a forensic pathologist. Their medical examination can help to determine the circumstances and cause of a person\u2019s death. Unfortunately, in Caddick\u2019s case the remains were too limited to establish any firm conclusions.\nHowever, the shoe itself can also have extensive legal and investigative significance.\nThis is where our research comes in. On land, the presence of certain insects can help in estimating someone\u2019s time of death. But when remains are found in a marine environment, we need to look for something else.\nOne useful organism is barnacles \u2013 common marine crustaceans that colonise (attach to) floating or submerged objects. It takes time for the larva to explore and search for an appropriate site. Once it finds the right surface, the baby barnacle deposits multi-protein adhesives (barnacle \u201cglue\u201d). \nNow permanently attached, the barnacle\u2019s growth depends on water temperature, velocity, food and competition with other barnacles. The barnacle\u2019s shell will store all of this information.\n\nSo, in a forensic investigation where barnacles are attached to shoes, clothes or exposed bones, they offer insights for estimating the body\u2019s point of origin, the amount of time it spent in the water, the waters it travelled and even the potential timeline of events. \nIn a study in which we examined 128 pairs of shoes colonised by barnacles, we observed settlement less than 15 days after the shoes were deployed in the water. \nIn another study on four fabrics (cotton, satin, velvet and neoprene) submerged for six months, we found the textile that changed the most was cotton, while neoprene was the most colonised by barnacles.\n\nMore research would help\nIn Caddick\u2019s case, the coroner\u2019s report notes the shoe must have spent between three and seven days floating on the open ocean, because the barnacles on it were still in the larval stage.\nHowever, it\u2019s not at all clear how long it was in the water, as it was found \u201cheavily discoloured\u201d; maybe it took time to surface or spent time elsewhere? \nDespite the fact that almost 80% of Earth\u2019s surface is covered by water \u2013 and this water can potentially become a crime scene \u2013 marine and aquatic forensics still need extensive research. This case highlights the need for more research on barnacles and other small marine organisms, such as bryozoans and foraminifera.\nBy studying their distribution and growth, we can improve our ability to investigate various cases, ranging from single shoes, to bodies and even missing planes.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Oceans, Forensic science, Missing people, Forensics, Sea, Investigations","role":"assistant"}]}

Bill 20, the Municipal Affairs Statutes Amendment Act, is part of a larger suite of bills designed to clamp down on dissent. \nBill 20 has garnered a lot of criticism for making it easier for the provincial government to remove locally-elected officials and overturn municipal bylaws. A lesser-known provision would also eliminate the practice of vouching during local elections. Vouching allows a verified person living in their polling district to attest to another person\u2019s identity so they can participate in the election.\nThe move might appear relatively uncontroversial. Indeed, most voters produce some form of physical identification at the polling station, like a driver\u2019s licence. \nYet, not all citizens have access to up-to-date ID with proof of residency. Denying eligible Canadian citizens their right to vote is a dangerous precedent that fundamentally undermines a cornerstone of democracy: accessibility. \n\n\n\n\n\nImportance of vouching\nVouching was established as an added safeguard for our elections, as previously citizens would only need to attest to their own eligibility to vote. It is an essential process that enables all eligible citizens to cast their ballot \u2014 whether they\u2019re someone living in a rural area with only a post-office box on their license, a person who lacks a fixed address, students or mobile workers, people who lack easy access to registries offices, those who cannot afford the cost, or someone whose ID has been lost, stolen or expired around election day. \nA key part of voter validation processes in most elections across Canada for decades, these vouching provisions have come under threat. Motivated by unsubstantiated concerns over voter fraud, irregularities and election integrity, some conservative politicians are borrowing pages out of the Republican playbook in the United States to restrict the number and types of people who are eligible to vote. Voter ID laws are one such measure.  \n\nDangers of voter ID laws\nAccording to Alberta Municipal Affairs Minister Ric McIver, Bill 20 is about \u201cstrengthening the rules so that Albertans can continue to have trust in local elections.\u201d However, the government has failed to provide evidence that trust is waning, that voter fraud is taking place or that Albertans want to do away with vouching as the solution. \nIn fact, evidence shows precisely the opposite.  Elections Alberta has recorded only seven cases of voting irregularities since 2013.  According to the government\u2019s own survey in fall 2023, nearly half (46 per cent) of Albertans want to keep vouching as part of our system of election integrity, with only 30 per cent wanting to abandon it. Furthermore, Alberta municipal leaders have argued that voter ID laws will not instill confidence in our democratic system, but rather sow distrust in the electoral process and depress turnout. \nIn this sense, voter ID laws in Alberta are a solution in search of a problem. As the B.C. Civil Liberties Association (BCCLA) puts it: \n\n\u201cVoter ID laws seek to address a single, largely speculative problem \u2014 an unproven phenomenon of wrongful impersonation of voters \u2014 at far too great a cost \u2014 disenfranchisement of Canada\u2019s most vulnerable and marginalized citizens.\u201d\n\nThe BCCLA was responding to attempts by the Conservative Party of Canada to do away with vouching at the federal level. Spearheaded by then-government minister, now Official Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre, the Fair Elections Act of 2014 drew criticism from Canada\u2019s Chief Electoral Officer who estimated it would disenfranchise up to 100,000 citizens. The issue did not make it to the Supreme Court of Canada before the law was repealed.\nThe United Conservative Party (UCP) government in Alberta took a look at vouching in 2021, tasking a Select Special Democratic Accountability Committee to examine the necessity of voter ID laws to protect election integrity in the province. The UCP-led process concluded that:\n\n\u201cVouching is key to ensuring that every Albertan has the opportunity to vote, not just those individuals who have the ability and means to obtain formal identification.\u201d \n\nThis begs the question: why, only three years later, is the UCP government forging ahead with a voter ID law against both evidence and the public will?\n\nDraconian laws\nMost Canadian jurisdictions have taken the route of expanding the franchise and making voting easier for eligible citizens. However, Alberta is following the path of many Republican-led U.S. states that have seen a degradation of voting rights in recent decades.\nThey have done so under a similar guise as the UCP: claims of restoring electoral trust. Harkening back to the Jim Crow era, states like Texas, South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South Dakota and Oklahoma have introduced laws restricting the ability of eligible voters to cast ballots. The spread and trajectory of these measures is alarming but predictable. Built on a faulty foundation, the laws are unable to address unfounded fears of voter fraud that motivated them. As a result, legislators introduce more and more draconian measures, including strict voter registration processes targeting marginalized communities. \nVoter ID laws in Georgia failed to deliver on their promise to address \u201cirregularities,\u201d for instance, prompting subsequent attempts to implement even more aggressive laws in 2017, 2018, 2021 and 2024. \nSimilar cases can be observed in Florida. Admired by Premier Danielle Smith, Governor Ron DeSantis has recently intensified efforts to curb voter participation with the proposed Senate Bill 7050. If passed, this bill would make it harder for people to register to vote through third-party organizations.  In Florida, racialized people are five times more likely to rely on third-party organizations than white people when registering to vote. \nThe bill also imposes restrictions on mail-in voting and could see more voters having their registration cancelled. These tactics are clearly part of a broader voter suppression strategy.\nVoter ID laws in the U.S. should serve as a stark warning for Albertans. Embracing draconian measures based on unfounded fears only serves to amplify distrust in electoral processes that, by all available evidence, are working well to curb abuse. If the pace and expansion of voter ID laws in the U.S. is any indication, Canadians across the country ought to take note of Bill 20 in Alberta and voice their concerns about the potential impact on their own voting rights.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Voting, Elections, Alberta, Voter ID, Voting rights, Voters, Ballots, Alberta politics","role":"assistant"}]}

Here, our academics review the six shortlisted books ahead of the announcement of the winner on June 13.\nBrotherless Night by V. V. Ganeshananthan\n\nThis is an unforgettable novel of formation \u2013 an awakening from tribal loyalties into new possibilities of identity and agency \u2013 set in Jaffna, Sri Lanka, during the civil war (1983 to 2009). The protagonist, Sashikala Kulenthiren, is a Tamil teenager, walking apace with her brothers toward medical or engineering degrees, and elaborations of a future peaceful with books, dialogue, and organic living.\nWhen the government atrocities and the call of militancy start disappearing boy after boy from the peninsula, Sashi is reduced to a bit-player of history. She becomes discombobulated by grief for fallen or embattled brothers. However, she finds strength and survives with a women\u2019s collective which agitates, organises and treats hypermasculinity, instead of serving it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGaneshananthan anatomises a separatist movement without once glorifying its concerted violence. The book is history-adjacent, the narrator says. It is one in a proliferating series that will counteract unimaginable loss, such as the burning of more than 97,000 volumes in the Tamil library by the Sinhalese police. \nAnkhi Mukherjee, professor of English and world literatures\nThe Wren, The Wren by Anne Enright\n\nBooker-winner Anne Enright is known for her masterful command of the family saga, particularly in an Ireland reeling from deep shocks like child abuse revelations or the global financial crisis. The Wren, The Wren charts the relationship between mother and daughter Carmel and Nell. The novel\u2019s pacing is derived from the ebbs and flows of their alternately unbearable closeness and mutual, generational alienation. \nEnright\u2019s characteristically tender approach to human fallibility is evident throughout, but what is particularly dazzling is her millennial voice. She wades into the world of bad-faith takes on \u201csnowflakes\u201d and a critical tendency to lambast millennial \u201csad girl novels\u201d, instead giving nuanced treatment to the simultaneous optimism and vulnerability of living now. \nEschewing her previous focus on landmark events in contemporary Ireland, Enright unpicks the feeling of being \u201cheld tight [by] some dream we had of mankind getting ahead of its stupid self, of us in particular getting ahead of the too-lateness of our time.\u201d\nOrlaith Darling, postdoctoral researcher in contemporary English literature and critical theory\nRestless Dolly Maunder by Kate Grenville\n\nProving Virginia Woolf correct in that \u201cwe think back through our mothers if we are women\u201d, Kate Grenville turns to her grandmother for inspiration in her tenth novel, Restless Dolly Maunder. The biofiction evokes the opportunities and frustrations of a woman born into the late 19th-century \u201chinge\u201d generation, when a door \u201cstarted to swing open\u201d that was previously \u201cshut tight\u201d. \nDolly is haunted with a sense of being \u201cmade in the wrong way\u201d; her teacher training foreclosed by her father, she finds herself an ambivalent wife and mother, dissatisfied by \u201cthe life other women are happy with\u201d. \nHer \u201cwanderlust\u201d is a painful force, driving her to continually uproot her family in pursuit of the next business venture. Grenville skilfully remains sympathetic to Dolly without minimising the impact of this itinerant existence on her children. \nThe novel\u2019s sole weakness is a tendency to recount too much faithful detail at the expense of narrative pace. Grenville\u2019s strength, conversely, is in the depth and nuance of her insight, revealing how the \u201cdifferent world\u201d she inherited from her grandmother came with a darker legacy of intergenerational mistakes.\nBethany Layne, senior lecturer in English literature\nSoldier Sailor by Claire Kilroy\n\nClaire Kilroy\u2019s poignant novel is the story of a mother who finds that child-rearing is a series of tiny battles, most of which she loses. \nThe mother, Soldier, talks to her son, Sailor, describing intense but ordinary despair at her constant \u201cfailures\u201d interspersed by fierce delight in him. She struggles with the irrational impossibility of completing tasks such as getting to a baby and toddler group. This impossibility cannot be conveyed to her husband, who continued his life uninterrupted, occasionally telling her what she is doing wrong or complaining that she has not cooked dinner or ordered milk. \nSoldier\u2019s experiences will be achingly familiar to many mothers. These experiences are rarely depicted in literature, and even more rarely depicted with such clarity and beauty. At times I could hardly bear to read. It made me so sad and furious. \nIt is an extraordinary book.  \nFiona Woollard, professor of philosophy\nRiver East, River West by Aube Rey Lescure\n\nAube Rey Lescure\u2019s River East, River West tells an intimate story which illustrates the effects that recent Chinese history has had on certain people\u2019s lives. Set in Shanghai and told from two perspectives, the novel begins in 2007 with 14-year-old Alva, awkwardly attending her mother Sloan\u2019s wedding to wealthy businessman Lu Fang, and then switches to the perspective of Lu Fang himself, moving back in time to 1985 when he works as a shipping clerk.\nThis insightful, poignant novel asks questions about family and loyalty and national identity and the contradictions and complexities of working out who we are and where we come from. It investigates the formative power of memory and loss, which can forge bonds or splinter lives apart. \nHope, in the end, comes in the form of family itself, dysfunctional and flawed though it may be.\nSally O'Reilly, honorary associate in creative writing\nEnter Ghost by Isabella Hammad\n\nEnter Ghost by Isabella Hammad explores the complicated situations in which Palestinians find themselves in Palestine and Israel. Its title is a reference to stage directions in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet, a play which the book\u2019s protagonist Sonia is convinced to take part in while visiting Haifa, Israel.\nSonia is a British-Palestinian but Haifa is where her father grew up and her sister, Haneen, now lives. As Sonia gets to grips with the material on and off the stage, she undergoes a sort of political and personal awakening. \nEverything she experiences is sharpened against Shakespeare\u2019s tale of revenge, from the domineering actions of Israeli soldiers to the shattering research into her Palestinian family history during the Nakba of 1948.\nIf Hamlet is haunted by the death of his father, the Palestinians are also haunted by their history and and the socio-political consequences emanating from it. The play is used to explore the dystopian nature of Israeli control over Palestinian lives, as well as the struggles that underpin people\u2019s lives in Palestine. \nHammad has crafted a complex tale interweaving prose and playwriting to tell an urgent story and bring forward ghosts that shouldn\u2019t be forgotten.  \nAtef Alshaer, senior lecturer in Arabic literature\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Literature, Reading, Books, Book reviews, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

The bill is due for debate in parliament today. The government clearly expects the bill will pass, because the new body has already been allocated A$54 million over four years in the May budget. \nWhy do we need it? Australia\u2019s natural world is in steep decline \u2013 based on what we know. But there\u2019s much we don\u2019t know.  \nAustralia has a fairly poor track record of effectively monitoring biodiversity. It\u2019s hard to care for and restore nature if we don\u2019t know how we are tracking, where to invest our efforts and into which activities.\nThe proposed agency will make environmental data more accessible by creating a platform where data from multiple sources can be pooled. These sources include: federal, state and territory governments, universities, research infrastructure platforms such as the Atlas of Living Australia and the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network, industry and citizen scientist data. \nIncreased access to relevant data would enable governments to better report on how well our environment is being managed. \nThe agency fills a gap in our environmental management regime. But by itself, it won\u2019t improve outcomes for nature. \nThe most important actions needed to reduce Australia\u2019s rapid losses of nature are the long-promised stronger environmental protection laws, which have been delayed indefinitely and a many-fold increase in funding for on-ground conservation programs. \n\nWhy do we need this?\nIn 2018, a national review of how Australia monitors its threatened species found 33% had never been monitored, while many others were only poorly monitored. \nWithout robust information, we can\u2019t focus our efforts where there is most need. We need to know where threatened plants and animals are still surviving, whether their populations are rising or falling, and what threatens them. \nWhile some of this data already exists, it is owned by hundreds of different organisations. \n\nMany of these monitoring activities are already undertaken inside the federal environment department. But there are some notable steps forward in what is being proposed in the new legislation. \nFirstly, efforts to increase the public sharing of data should be applauded.\nOne of the three objects of the proposed act is to \u201cimprove the availability and accessibility of high quality national environmental information and data,\u201d though the detail is yet to be released.\nAnother good change is requiring the important State of the Environment snapshot reports to be produced every two years, rather than every five.\nThe legislation also mandates the production of comprehensive and ongoing national environmental economic accounts by law. \nThese accounts \u2013 also called \u201cnatural capital accounts\u201d \u2013 are useful to track the health of different environmental assets at all scales, from the habitat of a single threatened species to the entire continent. \nWhile this is a positive step, it could be better. As the laws stand, these accounts would be narrowly focused on describing the condition of the environment and its relationship with the economy.\nBecause environmental accounts are standardised and ongoing, they offer an ideal platform for measuring changes in environmental conditions. They could support a major expansion of our small set of useful environmental indicators, such as the Threatened Species Index.\nIdeally we should have annual robust indices for a wide range of national environmental assets such as soil, water, plants, animals, ecosystems, and nature\u2019s contribution to people at all scales. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Australia-first research reveals staggering loss of threatened plants over 20 years\n\n\n\n\nMeasuring progress against targets\nOne of the goals of the proposed agency will be to measure our progress toward becoming \u201cnature positive\u201d. \nThe nature positive concept has been embraced internationally. The goal is ambitious: halt biodiversity decline by 2030 against a 2020 baseline and achieve recovery by 2050.\nUnfortunately, the government is proposing to embed a watered-down version of nature positive, leaving out the target dates and leaving the baseline open. \nIn response many Australian environmental scientists are urging the government to align with the international definition.\nIn November 2023, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek talked proudly of the leading role Australia played in securing an ambitious Global Biodiversity Framework. This agreement has 23 targets which signatory nations have agreed to in an effort to stop the loss of species and nature. \nTo measure progress toward the target of protecting 30% of lands and seas by 2030, we will need data on what areas are protected, how they\u2019re managed and which bioregions and plant communities they represent. That\u2019s a job for the new agency. \n\nTowards true nature positive development\nDespite the recent deferral, the government has committed to reform our national environmental laws. These reforms need to include strong protections for habitat crucial to the survival and recovery of threatened species and ecological communities. \nHere, too, the proposed agency should have a role, by modelling and mapping these critical habitats, which will help mark important areas as off limits to development. This could actually help accelerate building approvals by avoiding developers spending time on proposals unlikely to meet approvals. \n\nIf the agency is to be truly independent, as the government has promised, it will need to tackle tricky issues governments tend to shy away from, including a fully transparent account of environmental expenditures.\nThat covers not just the tiny amount the federal government spends on biodiversity protection, which languishes below 0.1% of total government spending, but total investment across all levels of government and different sectors.\nIf we want to tackle Australia\u2019s biodiversity crisis we have to be absolutely clear about the problems we are seeking to solve and get the basics right. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Threatened species have declined 2% a year since 2000.

But in doing so, the province\u2019s labour market has also become increasingly polarized in terms of geography, income and employment security.\nFord weathered the challenges of COVID-19 by incorporating a more activist, \u201cget it done\u201d stance into his style of governing. At the same time, his political rivals failed to provide compelling alternative visions of Ontario\u2019s economic future. \nThose seeking to unseat the Ford government in the next provincial election will need to offer different and compelling ways to address the polarized labour market and economic divisions in Ontario. These ideas will need to move beyond the neoliberal and populist ideals that underpin Ford\u2019s political success.\n\nVulnerable on environment, climate\nWith this in mind, the environment and climate change remain key areas of vulnerability for the Ford government because they illustrate its fundamentally reactive governance style. Another bad forest fire season this summer could further underscore the province\u2019s lack of any credible plan for reducing GHG emissions or responding to the impacts of a changing climate. \nOntario\u2019s record of emission reductions flowing from the 2003-2013 phaseout of coal-fired electricity and wider industrial restructuring has largely played out. Emissions are now rising, especially from the electricity sector, with a dramatic growth in the role of natural gas-fired generation, along with increases related to building heating and cooling and transportation. \nIn those sectors, the government is focused on expanding access to fossil fuels \u2014 particularly natural gas for space heating \u2014 and building new highways.\nVoters agitating?\nThe successful mobilization of organized labour against the Ford government\u2019s proposed use of the notwithstanding clause in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms to impose a contract on education workers highlights the risks of further significant social and political action against the government. \nThe widespread outrage over the government\u2019s removal of land from the Greater Toronto Area Greenbelt for urban development again emphasized Ford\u2019s potential vulnerabilities, despite his current lead in the opinion polls. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Doug Ford's Greenbelt scandal: The beginning of the end of his years in power?\n\n\n\n\nThe question of who actually wins under Ford\u2019s market populism must also loom large \u2014 everyday Ontario residents or well-connected developers, resource industries and entrenched incumbents in the energy and for-profit health-care sectors? \nFiscal irresponsibility?\nThere are also growing questions about the government\u2019s fiscal responsibility.  \nOver the last two years, the government has committed at least $150 billion in large energy and transportation infrastructure projects. Many of these projects \u2014 including Highway 413, the Highway 404-to-400 Bradford Bypass and the Pickering B nuclear station refurbishment \u2014 have been previously assessed as unnecessary and uneconomic.\n\nThe emerging financial impacts of accelerating the initiative to make beer and wine available at corner stores have the potential to add hundreds of millions more to the government\u2019s pattern of casually scrapping stable long-term revenue streams. In addition to the $225 million in up-front compensation to The Beer Store, there are projected losses to the province in LCBO revenues, licencing and cost-of-service fees.\nMore broadly, the province has lost approximately $1 billion a year in revenues from the cancellation of the greenhouse gas cap and trade program, the elimination of vehicle licencing fees and reductions in the provincial gasoline tax. \nWhat\u2019s more, there\u2019s an ongoing $7 billion a year diversion of general revenues designed to artificially lower hydro rates. This strategy takes funds needed urgently in areas like health care and education and effectively uses them to hide the actual costs of previous nuclear refurbishment projects.\nAll of these factors should amount to a moment of deep political vulnerability for the Ford government. But how voters might actually respond to an early election call if \u2014 unlike in 2022 \u2014 they respond at all, remains an open question.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Developers, Ontario government, Doug Ford, Ontario politics, Notwithstanding clause, Ontario Greenbelt","role":"assistant"}]}

It was not uplifting. The pull quotes tell a story of anguish. \u201cSometimes it is almost impossible not to feel hopeless and broken\u2026Running away from it is impossible.\u201d\nWrenching articles like these showcase climatologists\u2019 anxiety. They are watching their predictions realized with too much fidelity; their warnings going largely unheeded by the humanity that climate scientist James Hansen called \u201cdamned fools.\u201d Some climate scientists have even proposed a moratorium on climate research.\nClimatologists are not OK. \nThe acceleration of the climate crisis has been breathtaking and talking to experts in a time of crisis is a good thing. But these articles are problematic. They seek to motivate through fear while usualy offering only vague notions of absent \u201cpolitical will\u201d to diagnosis the problem and little beyond \u201clisten to the scientists\u201d as a solution.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther, the concerns and practices of climate social scientists have not featured prominently in these discussions. This is a significant oversight. \nClimate natural scientists are not trained to understand why people aren\u2019t listening to their entreaties or the obstacles to and opportunities for action. Climate social scientists, on the other hand, understand the climate crisis and are experts in humanity\u2019s efforts to address climate change.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The world is not moving fast enough on climate change \u2014 social sciences can help explain why\n\n\n\n\nOver the last two years, I have interviewed more than 20 colleagues across the climate social sciences about how they are navigating the climate crisis in their research, teaching and personal lives. These interviews were undertaken as part of an ongoing project exploring the perspectives and roles of climate social scientists in a time of climate crisis. They may offer a useful and motivating perspective that the world could certainly use. \nMixed feelings\nIt\u2019s not that climate social scientists are doing great either. They know too much about the climate crisis to be cheery \u2014 fear, guilt, gloom, anger and frustration were all prevalent. Cristina Yuma Aoki Inoue from Radboud University articulated a common lament: \u201cIf I think too much about the future, I get desperate.\u201d\nYet, none of those interviewed showed signs of throwing in the towel or leaving the climate crisis for amorphous others to solve. Instead, there\u2019s a conscious commitment to positivity in the face disheartening climate news. \nUniversity of British Columbia (UBC) scholar Peter Dauvergne noted that he is \u201cintentionally optimistic.\u201d And while some \u2014 like British political scientist Matthew Paterson \u2014 feel \u201cguilt that our community was not louder earlier,\u201d there is consensus around the \u201csense of possibility\u201d that Oxford University\u2019s Thomas Hale sees. \n\n\u201cHope is a practice,\u201d remarked Harriet Bulkeley from the University of Durham, and this community actively cultivates that practice.\nIn fact, none of the scholars I spoke with consider doing the work of understanding and conceiving a just, effective response to the climate crisis to be a choice. Climate despair is a luxury for those not living through climate disasters or who have the means to survive them. \nAs such there is a collective feeling of responsibility on the part of climate social scientists to work to advance long-term transformations towards sustainability and justice. This struggle is \u201call we are promised,\u201d Kemi Fuentes-George from Middlebury College clarified. And the work is valuable apart from the achievement of the solution to climate change. \nAs Peter Newell from the University of Sussex reminds us:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s empowerment in the process of working on this regardless of the outcome. We don\u2019t know if our efforts are enough, but we know that if we don\u2019t try at all, nothing will change.\u201d\n\nPromoting alternatives\nThe climate social science community starts their teaching and research where the bulk of the \u201cclimate scientists are despairing\u201d type articles end their discussions. By making concrete the vague notion of political will, and striving to specify necessary action in the face of climate crisis, social scientists help to provide key nuance. \nNo one thinks this will be easy. Indeed, as climate governance scholar Aarti Gupta expressed: \n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about what the climate crisis will do to already contested politics in a world with so much injustice and inequality. There is opportunity [if] we are actually all in this together, but the status quo will fight back tooth and nail.\u201d \n\nThose I spoke with are unanimously committed to articulating the possibilities for change in their research and classrooms. Rather than trudging through endless analyses of the failure to act, scholars like Kathryn Harrison at UBC are \u201cteaching the reality of obstacles while teasing out what might be different.\u201d \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How to stay hopeful in a world seemingly beyond saving\n\n\n\n\nEveryone I spoke with is committed to what Chukwumerije Okereke from Bristol University described as reflecting \u201cboth hope and anxiety\u201d in their work. But the key, as Dauvergne suggests, is focusing on \u201cmany future possibilities that could be better.\u201d \nClimate social scientists are explaining the crisis, but also showcasing where there is momentum for an equitable response to climate change and where more effort is needed to, in Indian climate policy expert Navroz Dubash\u2019s words, \u201cbuild the society we want to see.\u201d\nDay to day\nClimate social scientists are people too, living in world dominated by fossil energy. We research ways that might change, but often feel conflicted about personal choices. \n\nThe experts I interviewed think deeply about their personal actions. Importantly, they do so in light of commitments to understand and contribute to structural change, upending the dependence on fossil energy that pervades our societies. \nPersonal action and structural change are linked in their minds. Laura Tozer from the University of Toronto mentioned how important it was for her to \u201cfocus on choices I can make that others can as well. Trying to cut fossil fuels out of one\u2019s life gives great insight into the structural changes that are necessary.\u201d \nFurther, this group reminds us that individual actions are enmeshed in webs of larger networks and forces. In this vein, Brazilian scholar Veronica Goncalves remarked on a frequent refrain \u2014 the importance of collective experience and organizing; empowering communities and people in response to climate change. \nSuch connections need more than fear or despair to thrive. As the University of Toronto\u2019s Kate Neville emphasized:\n\n\u201cSeeking joy, connection and community is a crucial part of collective action \u2013 the climate-stable, ecologically-vibrant future needs to have space to be imagined as a joyful one, not an apocalyptic one, even though we know there is strife and grief and loss and upheaval.\u201d\n\nWhat now?\nWhile the climate scientists are despairing genre of articles is problematic, it captures an important aspect of the reality of the climate crisis. Humanity is moving too slowly. \nNavigating this crisis, however, means not only generating urgency, but also finding outlets for that urgency. It entails understanding and pursuing an equitable low-carbon future. Here is where climate social scientists can help.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Media, Mental health, Journalism, Teaching, Global warming, Social sciences","role":"assistant"}]}

They are responsible for ensuring prescriptions are filled accurately and in a timely fashion, and for providing advice and guidance to their customers about the medicines they dispense.\nBut, once again, this agreement shows the power the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, which represents the owners of community pharmacies, wields in shaping policy and funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s in the agreement?\nThe Community Pharmacy Agreement was started in 1990 and is renegotiated every five years.\nThis eighth agreement delivers A$26.5 billion in funding over five years, a $3 billion boost over the previous agreement. This represents about one-quarter of the total cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).\nOf the $26.5 billion, $22.5 billion is for the cost of dispensing prescriptions. The funding also includes $2.1 billion for a new Additional Community Supply Support Payment to address the pharmacy guild\u2019s concern about the financial impact of 60-day prescribing.\nThere\u2019s $1.2 billion to cover pharmacy services, including continuation and expansion of medication management and medical review programs.\nThis $1.2 billion also includes an increased Regional Pharmacy Maintenance Allowance, which aims to support access to PBS medicines and pharmacy services for people in rural areas. The program provides financial support to eligible pharmacy owners in regional, rural and remote settings. The new agreement increases funding for this allowance by $52 million. Some of the most remote pharmacies may be eligible to receive up to $95,000 per year in support.\n\nFurther, $484.4 million will cover the costs of a one-year freeze on the maximum PBS co-payment for everyone with a Medicare card and up to a five-year freeze for pensioners and other Commonwealth concession cardholders. These changes were announced in the recent federal budget. \nThese changes will require legislation for their enactment. When introduced, the bill should have further details of how this $484.4 million is distributed in costs to government and funding to pharmacies. \nThe power of the pharmacy guild\nThe Pharmacy Guild of Australia is recognised as a powerful lobbying organisation. It\u2019s interesting that pharmacy business owners and not pharmacy professional groups are the key drivers of government policy. Indeed, one analysis has characterised the Community Pharmacy Agreements as industry policy benefiting pharmacy owners rather than health policy. \nThis latest agreement exemplifies the fact that the pharmacy guild usually gets what it wants. Last year the Albanese government announced the 60-day dispensing policy, which doubled the amount of medicine dispensed with some scripts from a 30-day to a 60-day supply. The pharmacy guild launched an emotional attack, claiming huge pharmacy losses would result. \nThe government subsequently offered an early renegotiation of the Community Pharmacy Agreement (not due until 2025). The guild eagerly accepted this offer. \nIn March, Health Minister Mark Butler announced an agreement had been reached between the government and the pharmacy guild. The next Community Pharmacy Agreement would contain an extra $3 billion in pharmacy funding.\nThis extra funding includes the $2.1 billion, via the new Additional Community Supply Support Payment, to offset presumed pharmacy losses. Pharmacists will receive an extra $4.80, on top of the usual $8.37 dispensing fee and a $4.62 handling fee, when they give out a 60-day script. \nPlus there\u2019s the guarantee, in place since 2020, that remuneration per script will increase year on year over the life of the Community Pharmacy Agreement.\n\nAre the agreements effective?\nA number of reports have been critical of the lack of data about the effectiveness of the community pharmacy programs supported by the Community Pharmacy Agreements.\nA post-implementation review of the seventh agreement found that, in common with previous agreements, there was a lack of effective evaluation and assessment mechanisms for programs. The review said the scarcity and quality of available data for robust and meaningful analysis of health outcomes was a continuing concern. \nThe government\u2019s Medical Services Advisory Committee made similar findings about the sixth agreement. \nYet several of these medication management and review programs (for example, Dose Administration Aids, MedsCheck and Diabetes MedsCheck) continue to be funded with a 30% increase in this Community Pharmacy Agreement.\nDiscussion about other programs (for example, Home Medicines Review and Residential Medication Management Review) is continuing as part of the focus on \u201cnew and improved pharmacy programs\u201d, allocated $103.3 million in the agreement. \nThe pharmacy guild says it has secured a 22% increase in funding under this agreement compared to the last one. No other part of the health-care system has seen that level of increase in funding support. \nSuch exceptionalism should demand greater transparency, accountability and scrutiny of the influence of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on government policies.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Health policy, Health, Pharmacy, Pharmacy Guild of Australia, Community Pharmacy Agreement, Health in the news","role":"assistant"}]}

But the process of mining digital currencies such as Bitcoin requires immense computational power \u2013 causing a significant drain on energy resources.\n\u201cMiners\u201d use sophisticated hardware to solve complex mathematical puzzles, securing transactions and minting new coins. But this process, known as \u201cproof of work\u201d (PoW), is energy intensive. \nImagine a giant lock with a million combinations. Miners are all competing to find the right combination to unlock the block (a group of transactions) and earn rewards. The more computing power you have, the faster you can try different combinations. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut this computing power requires a lot of energy, similar to how a powerful car uses more petrol. So, miners are using a massive amount of electricity to run super-powered computers 24\/7. \nIn 2021, police in the United Kingdom raided an industrial unit under suspicion it was housing an indoor marijuana growing operation. They were surprised to discover instead an extensive Bitcoin mining setup which was illegally siphoning electricity from a mains supply.\nIn 2021, Bitcoin mining consumed enough energy to rank 27th among nations, ahead of Pakistan with a population of over 230 million people. Just a year later, Bitcoin\u2019s energy usage surpassed Finland\u2019s national power consumption. \nAlternatives have emerged to address the rampant energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining. But the question is, are these green currencies a viable alternative to the traditional options?\n\nThe emergence of green cryptocurrencies\nGreen cryptocurrencies use a less energy-intensive process known as \u201cproof of stake\u201d (PoS). Instead of needing a powerful computer, miners need to have a certain amount of the relevant cryptocurrency \u2013 kind of like a deposit.\nIf someone tries to cheat or mess with the system, they could lose some of their own cryptocurrency. This \u201cskin in the game\u201d keeps validators \u2013 those validating and verifying transactions \u2013 honest and secure.\nA pivotal moment for those interested in green alternatives was cryptocurrency Ethereum\u2019s migration to PoS in September 2022, through an update dubbed \u201cThe Merge\u201d. \nThis shift led to a 99.9% drop in Ethereum\u2019s energy use. Before the transition, Ethereum\u2019s energy consumption was on par with Switzerland. Post-merge, its power usage was closer to that of a small town. \nChallenges and the road ahead\nIn addition to Ethereum, several other cryptocurrencies are making significant strides in the realm of green finance. Notably, Cardano and Solana are gaining ground in the crypto market. They use significantly less energy, can handle larger numbers of transactions without slowing down, and claim to be secure.\nDespite the benefits, the shift to green cryptocurrencies is fraught with challenges. Some users worry PoS might be less secure than PoW. And those with more coins have a higher chance of validating transactions. This could lead to a situation where a few people control the network. \nMoreover, the initial distribution of coins in cryptocurrencies using PoS can be less democratic, often benefiting early adopters. \nAs a result, early adopters who accumulate a large number of coins can have a disproportionate influence on the network. This can be seen as less democratic because it gives more power to the wealthy, which goes against the decentralised ethos of cryptocurrencies.\nEvolution of green currencies continues\nPoS is not the only change attempting to address cryptocurrencies\u2019 energy consumption. Sharding is another. \nSharding divides the network into smaller sections called \u201cshards\u201d, each handling its own set of transactions. This frees up individual computers on the network (called nodes) from processing everything at once, leading to significantly faster transaction speeds and lower costs.\nThis innovation goes beyond just efficiency. Sharding\u2019s parallel processing approach minimises energy needs, potentially making cryptocurrencies more eco-friendly.\nEthereum\u2019s upcoming upgrade, Ethereum 2.0, incorporates sharding to address the network\u2019s current limitations on speed and transaction fees. By implementing sharding in phases, developers hope to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining the network\u2019s security and decentralisation.\nWhile sharding seems like a game-changer, it\u2019s not without its own hurdles. Implementing it effectively requires careful planning and rigorous testing to safeguard the network\u2019s integrity. \nOverall, sharding offers a glimpse into a future where cryptocurrencies can process transactions faster, become more cost-effective and even reduce their environmental impact. \nGreen cryptocurrencies show how technology and finance can support ecological sustainability, providing a model for others to follow. But there is always a risk. And as they develop, green cryptocurrencies need to address concerns over security, network integrity and accessibility.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Bitcoin, Cryptocurrency, Ethereum, proof of stake, proof of work","role":"assistant"}]}

Since the government could stay in power another six months and have an election in early 2025, why did Sunak opt to go early?\nIt\u2019s unlikely the early call provides some unique opportunity to extend the Conservative Party\u2019s rule yet again. Rather, a big loss is inevitable, and Sunak is perhaps being wise by getting this behind him and avoiding even worse outcomes such as losing the confidence of his party before an election. Avoiding a catastrophe might be the best Sunak can hope for. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Rishi Sunak and Keir Starmer's first election debate: the facts behind the claims\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of a political pendulum suggests that the public\u2019s preferences swing back and forth between major parties in a predicable fashion. One party takes over, consolidates power, likely wins additional elections but inevitably loses favour with voters while the other party rises in the polls and ultimately takes power back. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a pattern seen in many democracies \u2014 after a while, the public is ready for a change. Usually, the timing of the swing is predictable. After 14 years in office, the pendulum is swinging hard away from the Conservative Party.\nAccurately predicting UK elections\nMy American colleague Helmut Norpoth and I developed the PM and the Pendulum model, which has been successfully forecasting British elections since 2005. \nFor the 2005 election, the model forecasted a Labour lead of 132 seats over the Conservatives \u2014 close to the actual 159 Labour seat result. \nFor the 2010 election, the forecast was a hung parliament with the Conservatives ahead 311-265 \u2014 the actual result was 306-258. The model again correctly predicted Conservative wins in 2015, 2017 and 2019.\nThe model relies on two predictors \u2014 the cyclical patterns of previous election results for the major parties, and the level of approval for the prime minister. It\u2019s not dependent on voter intention polls. This has both positive and negative implications. \nOn the negative side, as bad as the prime minister\u2019s current approval rate is \u2014 about 17.5 per cent \u2014 the model is unlikely to predict a devastating Conservative loss. The history of recent British elections provides some boundaries for what the model will forecast since a loss as big as the current polls indicate is far outside the historical patterns.\nOn the positive side, forecasting the Conservatives to do much better than the polls are currently predicting \u2014 and perhaps being wrong by a wide margin \u2014 helps put into historical perspective just how bad the coming election seems likely to be for them. \n\nUltimate decline always on horizon\nThis is part of what election forecasting is about \u2014 not necessarily being prophetic, but estimating what history predicts for the outcome and then making comparisons to what actually happens. \nThe regular swing of the pendulum predicts that after two elections or so, the public begins to turn against the party in power. Being far ahead of the opposition in seats and in popularity can delay the transfer of power back. For example, the Tories under Margaret Thatcher built large enough majorities in 1983 and 1987 to allow them to hang on in a close contest in 1992. \n\nLikewise, big wins for Labour in 1997 and 2001 made a 2005 win possible. Some unpopular opposition leaders helped keep those governments going as well, according to our research. But the inexorable decline of the governing party in terms of government approval, leader approval and voter intentions is always somewhere on the horizon. \nThe 2019 election was an interesting anomaly for British politics in that the Conservatives extended their parliamentary and electoral advantage after smaller wins in 2010, 2015 and 2017. The usual pattern would have seen a swing away from the Conservatives. \nIn fact, the PM and the Pendulum model predicted a 2.4-point Conservative lead and a 311-268 MP lead over Labour. Instead, the electoral effects of Brexit alongside Boris Johnson\u2019s popularity and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity gave the Conservatives a much bigger win: an 11.5 per cent lead over Labour, translating into a 365-203 majority government. \nThe momentum of such a resounding victory typically carries forward into the election that follows. But not this year. \nA Labour landslide?\nAfter 14 years of Conservative rule under five different prime ministers, the July 4 election will likely bring Labour back to power in a victory similar in size to New Labour and Tony Blair\u2019s landslide in 1997. \nThis year\u2019s inputs for the PM and the Pendulum model are the election results from 2019 and 2017, plus the adjusted level of prime ministerial approval. Sunak\u2019s approval rating of 17.5 per cent is a dreadful sign for the Conservatives. Even when 35 per cent of voters say they will vote for parties other than Labour or the Tories, Sunak is nowhere close to pleasing half of the voters who are considering only the two major parties. \nThe model predicts a nine-point Labour lead over the Conservatives \u2014 well below the 22-point Labour lead the polls are currently showing. It is possible the eventual result will be more in line with this forecast than with current polls. \nFor one, the campaign could reignite some partisan identification among Conservative and Scottish Nationalist Party voters that would eat into the Labour lead. Or the polls could be overestimating the eventual support for the newly formed Reform Party, hiding a pocket of voters who will eventually return and vote Conservative.\n\nBut, most likely, Labour is heading to a victory that will be historic in size.\nNext, applying our seats model, a nine-point Labour lead would translate into 381 seats for Labour and 186 for the Conservative Party \u2014 a very comfortable majority government for Labour, but short of the landslide scope suggested by the latest polling figures. \nThe figure below shows the history of forecasts against the actual election results (less the 2024 outcome). The predicted loss of 206 seats since 2019 would be even sharper than their 1997 drubbing (-171 seats from 1992):\n\nAnother way of predicting the election result is to conduct computer simulations that take into account uncertainty about the true value of PM Approval, and the predictive power of past elections:\n\nConservative prospects are dim\nEven in a million simulated elections, the Conservatives don\u2019t eke out any wins, let alone enough for a majority government. \nFourteen years and five prime ministers in, the political pendulum is swinging hard against the Conservatives. If the PM and the Pendulum forecast is close to correct, it will be as good as the outgoing government could hope for. \nAn incoming Labour government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer will have a large majority and a long time until public opinion begins to swing back to the Conservative Party again.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Margaret Thatcher, Polling, British election, Rishi Sunak, British Labour Party, Public opinion polls, 2024 UK election","role":"assistant"}]}

In March, major photo agencies issued a rare \u201ckill notice\u201d on a photo of Catherine, Princess of Wales after evidence emerged that it had been tampered with. In May, Jonathan Yeo\u2019s official portrait of King Charles sparked online discussion with its arresting red background. And now a portrait of Catherine commissioned by Tatler from Zambian-British artist Hannah Uzor is provoking yet more debate with its questionable degree of likeness.\nIn fact, British monarchs have grappled with issues of representation, accuracy and flattery in portraits since the Middle Ages, as the stories of these five monarchs show.\n1. Henry VII (reigned 1485-1509)\n\nFrom the reign of Edward I until 1504, England\u2019s silver currency carried a generic, full-face representation of a nonspecific king. \nThe image was intended to convey universal royal power, rather than individual likeness. Henry VII had a relatively weak claim to the throne when he defeated Richard III in 1485, but he recognised the value of the visual arts in promoting his reign. In 1504, his government ordered a reform of the coinage, issuing silver coins with a new likeness of Henry VII in profile. The coins showed the king with shoulder-length curly hair \u2013 and a rather prominent nose. \n\n\n\n\n\nClearly Henry felt that the older, generic likeness was no longer adequate for the needs of modern monarchy. By tying the currency\u2019s regal authority to his own image, he reinforced his legitimacy, but also looked back to ancient imperial precedents, triggering a new trend for royal portraits that truly resembled their sitters.\n\n2. Mary Queen of Scots (reigned 1542-1567)\nOn February 10 1567, Lord Darnley, husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, died in an explosion in Edinburgh. On subsequent nights, mysterious voices were heard in the streets, accusing Mary\u2019s rumoured paramour, the Earl of Bothwell James Hepburn, of murder. \nPlacards appeared depicting the queen as a bare-breasted mermaid, holding a falconry lure to symbolise her siren-like seduction of Bothwell. As a symbol of prostitution, the mermaid undermined Mary\u2019s virtue, presenting her as a scheming, lustful woman. \n\nA horrified Mary summoned her ministers in an attempt to discover the name of the artist, but a sketch of the placard had already made its way to England, where it survives to this day in the English State Papers.\nAlthough sent with a note condemning the \u201cundutiful\u201d behaviour of Mary\u2019s subjects, it was filed away by Elizabeth I\u2019s chief advisor William Cecil as an example of negative intelligence about Mary, whose execution he later orchestrated.\n3. Elizabeth I (reigned 1558-1603)\nRecognising the damage that bad representations could do to a monarch\u2019s reputation, Elizabeth I\u2019s regime made several attempts to control her image. As early as 1563, a proclamation was drafted prohibiting portraits containing \u201cerrors and deformyties\u201d. This was never enacted, but a similar warrant issued at the end of her reign, in 1596, ordered the destruction of unflattering portraits of the queen.\n\nIn the 1590s, when Elizabeth was in her 50s, artists often employed the \u201cmask of youth\u201d in her portraits: a fictive, never-ageing face pattern, intended to allay fears about Elizabeth\u2019s advancing age and lack of heirs. \nBut one artist who did not follow this trend was Isaac Oliver, whose miniature (created circa 1590) presents an unusually accurate likeness of the ageing queen. The portrait was apparently never finished, and historians have sometimes assumed that Elizabeth rejected it. \nIn fact, the portrait had a successful afterlife, even serving as the face pattern for the Ditchley Portrait (1592), which apparently delighted Elizabeth with its vision of the queen as a quasi-divine giantess. \n4. George III (reigned 1760-1820)\nWhen the French Revolution began in 1789, many in Britain feared the revolutionary spirit would spread. In 1792, the Royal Proclamation Against Seditious Writings and Publications was issued \u2013 primarily as a response to the popularity of Thomas Paine\u2019s book Rights of Man (1791), which argued in favour of popular revolution against despotic monarchs and hereditary aristocracy. \nThe royal proclamation outlawed \u201call such Attempts which aim of the Subversion of all regular Government within this Kingdom\u201d, and looked set to impinge on the rights of caricaturists such as James Gillray, who regularly parodied members of the government and royal family.\n\nGillray\u2019s retort, Vices overlook\u2019d in the New Proclamation (1792), took aim at the king\u2019s hypocrisy, representing George III and Queen Charlotte as \u201cavarice\u201d clutching moneybags, and the Prince of Wales, future George IV, as \u201cdrunkenness\u201d.\nA year later, the French king was beheaded and France declared war on Britain, leading many caricaturists to tone down their representations of the royal family for a time. But fear of sedition remained. \nIn 1795, two acts known collectively as the Gagging Acts made it a treasonable offence to incite people to hatred or contempt of the king or government \u201cby publishing any printing or writing\u201d \u2013 a clause that encompassed caricatures like Gillray\u2019s.\n5. Victoria (reigned 1837-1901)\n\nNot all unpopular royal portraits were suppressed for being offensive \u2013 they could also be deemed too sexy. Queen Victoria commissioned a portrait from the German painter Franz Xaver Winterhalter in 1843, as a surprise gift for her husband Prince Albert\u2019s 24th birthday.\nShe referred to it in her diary as \u201cthe secret picture\u201d. Kept in Albert\u2019s private writing room at Windsor, it depicts Victoria in a low-cut, translucent dress, leaning against a red cushion, her lips slightly parted. \nAfter her death in 1901, the portrait was apparently thought \u201ctoo overtly sexual\u201d to be shown to the public, and was only finally put on display in 1977.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"History, Art, Royal Family, Art history, Portraiture, Royals, Portraits, The royals, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

To calculate someone\u2019s BMI, you divide their weight in kilograms by their height in metres times itself. The resulting number is used to determine a person\u2019s health risk. \nAlthough there are far better ways of getting an accurate measure of a person\u2019s body fat levels \u2013 such as using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (Dexa) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) \u2013 these are very resource-intensive. This may explain why BMI has remained the go-to method for measuring health since it first started being used in the latter part of the 20th century.\nBut many health experts believe BMI has significant limitations, particularly for children and young people (whose body fat levels change as they grow), athletic people (who have high levels of muscle mass) and people from ethnic minority groups (who may develop health problems at lower body fat levels).\nBMI was never created for use in health and was developed using data from European people in the 19th century. Although child and ethnicity\u2010specific adjusted BMI and alternative height and weight ratios have been suggested, none have made sufficient headway to improve BMI\u2019s reputation.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral alternatives to BMI have also been suggested \u2013 such as using waist-to-hip ratio (waist circumference divided by hip circumference) or body volume index (which uses 3D body scanners to estimate total body fat distribution). \nBut a recent study suggests that instead of BMI, we should be using something called body roundness index (BRI) to get a more accurate picture of a person\u2019s body fat levels and predict health risk. \nWhat is body roundness index?\nBRI was developed by US researchers in 2013 in response to criticisms of BMI. Instead of looking at height and weight, BRI mathematically quantifies body fat levels by looking at height and waist circumference instead. This provides a value typically ranging from one to 20. It is the lowest and highest values that suggest the highest health risk.\nNumerous studies have shown that BRI may be better than BMI at predicting the health risks associated with different levels of body fat. This includes predicting risk of weight-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease and cancer, as well as death from any cause.\nThis latest study, which looked at 32,995 US adults between 1999 and 2018, found an association between BRI and death from any cause. Specifically, they also found that people with the lowest and highest BRI scores had the greatest health risks. \nThey also found that BRI was better than BMI at accurately detecting this risk. This is because BRI considers the fat held around the abdomen, which is linked to greater risk of health problems. This is different to BMI, which only considers overall weight. \n\nBRI vs BMI\nGiven BRI only requires a tape measure and a maths equation, this means it\u2019s as easy to use and accessible as BMI. But assuming BRI is manually measured, it remains as subject to human error as BMI. \nOne study even found that eight out of ten trained health professionals demonstrated such high levels of human error when manually measuring the abdomen that they failed to notice an increase of 3cm the second time they took the measurement. This margin of error will probably be even higher in people taking their own measurements at home.\nAs a new metric, BRI also does not yet have the kind of extensive data backing up its use that exists for BMI. This makes it harder to know just how effective and reliable it is compared to these more established methods.\nAnd like BMI, BRI is a composite measure \u2013 meaning it combines multiple highly related measures into a single index. This makes it very hard to unpick the impact that different body fat levels can have on health \u2013 and can lead to misleading interpretations of the results.\nWhile BRI may improve on some of BMI\u2019s shortcomings, it\u2019s not immune to misclassification. For example, people with high muscle mass might still face inaccuracies in their health risk assessments if their body fat distribution does not conform to \u201ctypical\u201d patterns around the abdomen. Research also suggests that BRI\u2019s accuracy at predicting the health risks may vary depending on a person\u2019s ethnicity, age and sex.\nBRI most certainly represents an advancement in the hunt for a more accurate alternative to BMI by focusing more on body shape and fat distribution rather than just body size. But it still has its limitations. Although this latest study gives us more data on BRI\u2019s accuracy, more research is still needed before we can be certain it\u2019s better than BMI and should replace it.\nPerhaps an even better way of getting a picture of a person\u2019s health is to use 3D body surface imaging. This creates a scale digital 3D image of the human body which allows health professionals to explore all potential existing body measures, including both BRI and BMI, as well as allowing us to explore new digital alternatives.\nBut regardless of which body measure you or a doctor may use to asses your health, it\u2019s important to remember that every person is unique, and our bodies do \u2013 and should \u2013 always come in a wide range of shapes and sizes.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Obesity, BMI, Body mass index, Body fat, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nThousands of global health volunteers, most from the United States, travel to Africa every year. These volunteers come from diverse backgrounds and have varying levels of experience. They include surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nurses and medical students. They arrive with the ambition to improve health outcomes in Africa and learn about \u201cglobal health\u201d. \nIn my research I have studied the impact of these volunteers in Zambia. Between 2014 and 2016, I conducted research at a rural hospital where medical volunteers from the US provided various forms of medical care, including eye surgeries, caesarian sections, and treatments for malaria, tuberculosis and HIV. \nIn my latest research paper I examine how the presence of these volunteers affected the lives and relationships of people in Zambia. \nMy key finding is that the presence of medical volunteers caused damage to the relationships between Zambian health professionals and patients. \n\n\n\n\n\nI identify this as a kind of \u201crelational harm\u201d. \nThese findings are important because relationships are central to the delivery of effective healthcare. Clinical care requires material infrastructure: power, water, hospital beds, medical gloves and technical devices. But it also requires strong relationships of cooperation, trust and mutual recognition. \nI conclude from my findings that academics, volunteers, and global health organisations should pay more attention to the \u201crelational harm\u201d that volunteering can cause in under-resourced settings where privileged volunteers work amid extreme inequality. \nThe impact\nDrawing on long-term ethnographic research and interviews with Zambian health workers and patients, I found that local opinions about global health volunteers were divided. \nAt the hospital where I conducted my research, patients were often enthusiastic about their presence while many Zambian health professionals were critical.\nPatients regularly praised volunteers and described positive encounters with them. One Zambian patient described a medical volunteer as having \u201ca heart for patients \u2026 he doesn\u2019t look at who he is dealing with \u2026 he can be there for anyone.\u201d \nTo many patients, it seemed that volunteers often provided a higher quality of care than Zambian staff members. \nBut this was, in part, due to differences in wealth, status and privilege between American volunteers and Zambian health workers. \nWhile American volunteers could focus entirely on their hospital work, Zambian staff members had families to support, social events to attend, and school bills to pay. This meant that they could not spend as much time at the hospital or offer patients gifts, including small payments (known as \u201ctransport money\u201d), that volunteers often offered to patients. \nThis was noted by Zambian health workers, such as Matthew, who told me the following: \n\nMost {patients} will say that {the volunteers} will help with transport money and {the patients} get back home and then they share with their friends that they got transport money. But sometimes this is at the expense of local staff who then get called bad.\n\nIn addition, Zambian health workers felt that their hard work and expertise were being overlooked. As another staff member explained:\n\nThese international {volunteers} \u2026 they really look like they are better and even patients start to see a big gap. But it is not that Zambians are worse.\n\nThis staff member was pointing out that volunteers were often able to provide care that appeared to be \u201cbetter\u201d because they could work for longer hours, offer transport money, or even use newer technologies and medical devices. \nIn this context, staff members felt that they were judged negatively by patients because of the presence of volunteers. \nWhen patients expressed a preference for white volunteers \u2013 particularly those with less expertise \u2013 it often negatively affected Zambian health workers. As an experienced Zambian health professional told me:\n\nWhen somebody comes in and says they want to be treated by a white student, then you feel like a stranger in your own country.\n\nThe presence of volunteers therefore strained the relationships between staff members and patients, creating new forms of anxiety, resentment, and division. \nStaff members and patients were concerned that these tensions would continue to affect their relationships in the future \u2013 even in the absence of volunteers. \nWhat can be done\nThese findings can contribute to growing debates about the benefits and risks of global health volunteering. \nCritics have argued that medical volunteering reinforces inequality and paternalism, as well as causing direct harm through medical negligence. Supporters of medical volunteering argue that these risks can be overcome when medical volunteers are responsible and informed. \nFocusing on the impact of medical volunteering on local relationships offers a new perspective. \nIn the future, global health volunteers and the organisations that promote volunteering should reflect on whether their work is damaging relationships in healthcare settings. In under-resourced contexts, these relationships are often particularly fragile, as researchers working in Sierra Leone in the aftermath of Ebola have shown. \nThose who decide to volunteer should consider whether they are leaving these relationships in a better or a worse condition than they found them. If their aim is to improve health outcomes, they should ask how they might use their resources to strengthen these relationships instead of undermining them.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Relationships, Volunteering, Hospitals, Doctors, Global health, Patients, Nurses, Zambia, health professionals, Clinics","role":"assistant"}]}

They are part of a larger UN-backed \u201csupport\u201d mission tasked with establishing order, pushing back the advances of criminal gangs and allowing the freshly appointed interim government to function effectively.\nIn total, around 2,500 officers are expected to join the mission from a host of nations, including the Bahamas, Jamaica, Guyana, Barbados, Antigua and Barbuda, Bangladesh, Benin and Chad. This multinational police force will do the heavy lifting on the ground. But the bulk of the money to see the mission through will come from the US.\nIt is a noble initiative aimed at rescuing what many regard a failed state. However, there is plenty of scepticism surrounding the efficacy of this mission, not least from many Kenyans and Haitians who are not particularly enthusiastic about it.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How Haiti became a failed state\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExternal intervention has become a recurring event in contemporary international society. It has been undertaken in several contexts under the guise of \u201chumanitarianism\u201d for the purpose of protecting lives, establishing order in a conflict-ridden society and giving a new lease of life to a state that is failing in its primary functions.\nHowever, intervention in another country\u2019s affairs is a double-edged sword. There exists an established body of literature that argues foreign military interventions have not always been helpful or advantageous for the country on whose behalf it is undertaken. In fact, in some situations, it can do more harm than good. \nThere are two reasons for this. First, any form of intervention, military or otherwise, undermines a nation\u2019s sovereignty. And second, if the core objective of the intervention is not fulfilled by the intervener, it may compound the anger of those on whose behalf it was undertaken.\nYet another foreign intervention\nThis Kenyan-led mission will not be the first to intervene in Haiti\u2019s internal affairs. Haitians have experienced two other external military interventions in the last 30 years. But each intervention has done precious little.\nIn 1994, the US sent 20,000 troops to join a UN peacekeeping force in Haiti in an operation to return Haiti\u2019s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to power after a coup. Then, after Aristide was again forced from power in 2004, troops from the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti served in the country until 2017.\nAs part of a nation that was borne out of a slave revolt in 1791, Haitians of all walks of life have always reviled external interventions in their country. However, that sentiment has hardened in recent years following horrifying experiences with external forces trying to be \u201cdo-gooders\u201d.\nIn 2005, Brazilian troops conducted a \u201cpacification\u201d operation in Cit\u00e9 Soleil, the largest slum of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince. The troops in question were responding to reports of a disturbance in the slum when they were confronted by irate residents. \nThey responded with violence. According to witnesses, the troops murdered 63 people and wounded another 30. That grief is still raw in Haitian memory. \nThis grief was compounded in 2010 when a contingent of UN peacekeepers accidentally released contaminated water from their camp into local waterways. A cholera outbreak followed, leading to the deaths of up to 30,000 people.\nDuring that same period, a number of UN blue berets from Brazil and Nepal were found to have raped women and girls, or sexually exploited them in exchange for food or support. \nA report produced by the Associated Press in 2017 revealed that, despite repeated denials by the UN, 114 of its peacekeepers ran a child sex ring in Haiti over a ten-year period and were never punished for their sordid sexual violence.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      'They put a few coins in your hands to drop a baby in you' \u2013 265 stories of Haitian children abandoned by UN fathers\n\n\n\n\nGiven the enormity of these abuses in the hands of those who were meant to keep them from harm\u2019s way, many in the country feel that past external interventions made life worse. Little wonder some in the country consider any talk of outsiders addressing the plight of Haitians as patently hypocritical.\n\nThe reason why many outside of Haiti are hopeful that Kenyan intervention can succeed where others have failed is based on an unspoken racial assumption. Given the scandalous UN peacekeeping operations and tainted military US interventions in the past, it is assumed that the current mission will have a natural legitimacy, be less contentious and enjoy a bigger chance of success, if there is a racial similarity.\nThe racial aspect of \u201chumanitarian intervention\u201d has perhaps been best highlighted by former Kenyan foreign minister, Alfred Mutua. When asked in August 2023 about the reason behind possible Kenyan intervention in Haiti, he said: \u201cKenya stands with persons of African descent across the world.\u201d\nPutting aside the racial dimension, the chances of the latest mission\u2019s success is far from assured. There are currently an estimated 200 gangs operating across Haiti, and membership of gangs runs into the tens of thousands. They have a stranglehold on the country\u2019s infrastructure, and they have driven hundreds of thousands of people from Port-au-Prince. \nHaiti\u2019s armed gangs are the country\u2019s real power brokers, with partners in politics and the private sector. Making them give up their lucrative operations in this broken country by way of a token 2,500 foreign police officers will probably be asking too much.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Caribbean, Military intervention, Haiti, Gang violence, Peacekeeping, UN peacekeeping, Haitian Revolution, French Caribbean, Haitians, Haitian politics, Give me perspective, Haiti gangs, Haiti armed gangs","role":"assistant"}]}

Most recently, Turkish officials have rejected claims by the British Museum that British diplomat Lord Elgin was given permission from Ottoman authorities to remove the marbles from the Acropolis in Athens in the early years of the 19th century.\nThe Parthenon marbles are probably the most renowned example of a country calling for heritage objects to be returned. They are part of a larger move to investigate the colonial contexts through which most western museum collections have been formed. As a result, we are beginning to see greater transparency about acquisition histories. \nThere\u2019s also a new willingness in specific cases to repatriate \u2013 or \u201cbring home\u201d \u2013 contested objects, such as the Benin Bronzes, some of which are in the process of being repatriated to Nigeria. \n\nAll repatriation cases matter greatly to those involved, but that of the Parthenon marbles has become famous far beyond the dispute between the key parties of Greece and the UK. Why, then, do they resonate so deeply? In what ways were they important in classical Greece, and to the modern Greeks now?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Parthenon marbles were removed from the Acropolis in Athens by Lord Elgin between 1801 and 1805. He then shipped them to Britain to join the collections of the British Museum in 1816. \nThe removal happened under Ottoman imperial rule, a mere five years before the creation of the modern Greek state. Today, the British Museum has 17 figures from the pediments (the triangular shape that forms the gable of the temple\u2019s pitched roof), 15 high-relief metopes (the decorated panels placed just above the colonnade), and 75 metres of the low-relief frieze which encircled the Parthenon. These are in addition to materials from other structures on the Acropolis.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The Parthenon marbles: George Osborne wants to return the statues to Athens, but can he? A legal expert explains\n\n\n\n\n\nSince 1983, Greece has formally sought the return of the marbles. Debate has swirled around the legality of ownership, where they are best cared for and displayed, and the idea \u2013 at the forefront of current discussion \u2013 that they belong together as part of a carefully designed building. Since 2009, a purpose-built Acropolis Museum has been ready to display the marbles together, so they can be viewed within sight of the Acropolis.\nThe importance of the marbles\nThe Parthenon is a temple dedicated to Athena, patron goddess of Athens, that sits atop the Acropolis hill. It is regarded today as one of the most important monuments of the ancient world, an artistic and architectural wonder. \nOne measure of its modern importance is that the logo of Unesco \u2013 keepers of the World Heritage List \u2013 refers to the temple. Indeed, the whole Acropolis has been inscribed as a world heritage site since 1987. The sculptures are stunning works of art but beyond that, they embody the identity of classical Athens, its myths of origin and its ideologies. They are a physical manifestation of what it meant to be Athenian during the 5th century BC.\n\nThe Parthenon was a monument of Athenian imperial power, but also a hymn to democracy (if not in the form we recognise today \u2013 this was a society with slavery, after all). \nIt is the marbles\u2019 symbolic message of equality and freedom that resonates so powerfully today, and which gives them both local historical significance and modern global importance. It was because of the legacy of antiquity, the literature, philosophy and arts of Greece, that western Europeans, by the 18th and 19th centuries, viewed Greece as the cradle of western civilisation. \nBritish historian Paul Cartledge, in making the case for their return, has stated that \u201cthe Parthenon sculptures simply mean much, much more to the Greeks than they do to us in Britain\u201d.\nThe reasons for their importance to Greece (far beyond any of the thousands of Greek artefacts in museums across the world) are clear, yet complex. The ancient  past was drawn upon as a unifying symbol of the modern Greek state. \n\nTwo short examples help illustrate the role the Parthenon and its marbles play in the modern Greek imagination. The first is a fractious incident in December 2014, when the British Museum loaned the figure of the reclining Greek river god Ilissos (which was originally part of the Parthenon) to the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, Russia. \nAt the time, the museum\u2019s director, Neil McGregor, suggested it would be the first time that the people of Russia had been able to see this great moment of \u201cEuropean\u201d art and thought.\nThe framing of the sculpture as belonging to Europe is suggestive and links into the global story embedded in the marbles. It also illustrates the soft political power of the world of international museum exchanges. Unsurprisingly, this sparked sharp anger in the Greek press. \nThe second is a much older story. According to 19th-century folklore, when one of the six Caryatids (the female figures that form the architectural support for the temple) was removed from the Erechtheion (a temple on the north side of the Acropolis), locals claimed to have heard the others \u201cwailing in sadness, calling for their sister\u201d.\nThat image \u2013 of Parthenon sculptures as lonely, abducted and imprisoned away from the Athenian sun \u2013 has been used in campaigns for their return, and speaks strongly to the emotive connections with the marbles that Greeks feel today.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Ancient Greece, Heritage, Museums, Elgin Marbles, British Museum, Repatriation, Parthenon, Acropolis, Athens, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

That is, how can governments control the distribution of harmful online material within a country when the internet is global? Do global takedowns unfairly limit free speech? Does \u201cgeo-blocking\u201d strike an acceptable balance between restricting harmful content and free speech?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      eSafety commissioner drops court effort to force Elon Musk to put international ban on stabbing video\n\n\n\n\nWhat was the case about?\nIn April, the eSafety Commissioner issued X with a removal notice instructing it to take \u201call reasonable steps\u201d to take down videos of the stabbings. A central consideration in issuing the notice was that the New South Wales Commissioner of Police had described the stabbing as a terrorist incident. \nX \u201cgeo-blocked\u201d (blocking content depending on location) the video for Australian audiences but refused to impose a wider global ban. The eSafety Commissioner viewed this as a failure to abide by its removal notice, and commenced proceedings in the Federal Court. \n\nA central question in the case was whether the geo-blocking of material to stop Australian users accessing the content constitutes the taking of \u201call reasonable steps\u201d under the legislation when that material is globally available. \nIn a hearing before the Federal Court in May, the barrister for the Commissioner had stated that in order for X to take \u201call reasonable steps\u201d there had to be a global ban. They pointed to the ease of buying a VPN (virtual private network) to avoid the domestic takedown.\nWhy did the eSafety Commissioner drop the case?\nThe eSafety Commissioner cited the prudent use of public funds as one of the reasons for dropping the case, as it also has other litigation in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.\nAlthough this is a legitimate consideration, it was also obvious the argument for a global ban on the material was a difficult one to make given that it would operate outside Australia. \nWhile Musk has been calling this a victory, it is only the case for a global ban that has been dropped. The removal notice stands pending X\u2019s review and it may very well be that the geo-blocking will remain. At least in Australia, posting a video of a stabbing may still be treated as beyond accepted community standards. \n\nWhile the Online Safety Act allows for local authorities to issue an extraterritorial order, whether that extends to issuing a global ban is an open question. Even if a global order can be made under the act, it may not mean much in practice. Countries regulate free speech within their own jurisdictions and take their own position as to what is legitimate free speech and what is harmful content. \nA court in another country may take a dim view of a global order and not enforce it in their jurisdiction. But another country may also decide to ban the content under their own laws.\nWhat happens next?\nEven though the Federal Court case has been discontinued, the regulation of social media in Australia continues to be a central focus of political and legal debate. \nIn addition to the litigation between the commissioner and X in other tribunals, there are two major reviews occurring in the next few months: a review of the Online Safety Act and a Parliamentary Inquiry into Social Media. These will examine some of the legal issues that would have been considered by the Federal Court, such as the regulation of harmful content disseminated over social media. \nHowever, it would have been preferable to have a court ruling on these issues, particularly as there is uncertainty about key parts of the Online Safety Act.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Investigating social media harm is a good idea, but parliament is about to see how complicated it is to fix\n\n\n\n\nInternationally, online safety is also being tested and debated in other countries. For instance, the UK Online Safety Act has been criticised for unduly limiting free speech. These are therefore matters calling for international cooperation.\nLooking ahead, it is becoming increasingly apparent the power of tech companies is affecting the ability of safety regulators to constrain their activities. The Australian eSafety Commissioner described X as \u201cconsistently non-compliant\u201d. \nWhatever view is taken of the arguments made in the Federal Court case, the power wielded by tech companies and their ability to circumvent Australian law should be a central concern of the Australian government going forward.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Terrorism, Federal Court, Freedom of speech, Geoblocking, Society, Internet law, Elon Musk, Tech companies, Internet regulation, Ethics of tech companies, eSafety Commissioner, X (formerly Twitter)","role":"assistant"}]}

But this is a way of asking even more from young people who will have already suffered disruption to their education and social development as a result of the pandemic, some of whom have seen increased family hardship from the cost of living crisis and a lack of support due to widespread cuts in youth services. \nSunak\u2019s plan positions young people as a problem. Requiring them to develop an ethos of service suggests that this is lacking in young people. Sunak has commented that national service will keep young people \u201cout of trouble\u201d.\n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts? Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we\u2019ll fact check the claims being made. Sign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nThis view of youth is far from new. Criminologist Stanley Cohen used the term \u201cmoral panic\u201d to discuss the widespread and overblown alarm over disturbances between mods and rockers in 1964. These commotions occurred within a year of the end of national service. The press bemoaned the end of the scheme at the time and since its end there have been repeated calls for its reintroduction, particularly when the moral panic is concerned with the behaviour of young men.  \nWhether through drugs, anti-social behaviour, knife crime, early pregnancy, sexual identity, exploitation and radicalisation, young people are often labelled as thugs, users or victims. \nCuts to youth provision\nBut today\u2019s teenagers have been let down. In the last 14 years, youth services have been cut massively  by the current Conservative and preceding coalition governments.  Safe places to meet, spend leisure time and have fun, overseen and supported by trained youth workers who are committed to offering them guidance and support, have been targets of austerity and local authority cuts. \nBetween 2010 and 2019, the UK\u2019s youth service budget has been cut by \u00a3400 million. More than 760 centres have closed and 4,500 youth work jobs have been lost. \nGovernment research, published in 2024, has found that if young people were able to attend a youth club they were likely to live healthier lives, less likely to be truant from school and more likely to attend higher education. But many young people are now missing out on the benefits of these services. \nThe impact of these cuts has affected all young people, but it is the most vulnerable who have been hardest hit. Those who live in areas of social and economic deprivation are at much more risk and experience the most entrenched inequality and lack of opportunity. \n\nNational service would have the most striking effect on the most disadvantaged young people \u2013 those who are least likely to be able to give up weekends when they may have jobs or caring responsibilities, or spend a year out of the job market in the military. No solid plan on how mandatory national service would be enforced has been put forward, but if it involved fines, these would most penalise the poorest families. \nA raw deal\nYoung people have been denied access to safe places and the youth workers who might support them. They have been the victims of a global pandemic that has seen them stripped of the usual rites of passage. \nThey face years of living with their parents due to unstable employment, zero-hours contracts, student loans,  high rents and unattainable deposits. \nIn the face of all of this, they are \u2013 not surprisingly \u2013 experiencing unprecedented levels of mental ill-health. In 2023 there were a record number of young people referred to child and adolescent mental health services.  \nWhat young people need is a level of understanding, some sympathy with what they have faced over the last decade and a robust youth service restored \u2013 not to be required to also give up their weekends or spend a year of their lives in the military.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Austerity, Young people, Youth services, National service, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nBack in March 2022, Disney\u2019s then-CEO Bob Chapek said that his company wouldn\u2019t take a public stand on Florida\u2019s so-called \u201cDon\u2019t Say Gay\u201d bill. Four days later, he yielded to rebukes from LGBTQ employees, reversed his decision and criticized the bill publicly. \nIn the ensuing political firestorm, the state of Florida revoked Disney\u2019s 55-year-old favored tax and regulatory status, sparking legal disputes that lasted well into 2024. Chapek, deeply weakened, was fired not long after the controversy broke, in November 2022.\nDisney may be a unique case, but it isn\u2019t alone. Business leaders are increasingly at risk of political sparks igniting into firestorms that can devastate their companies. For example, in 2023, the conservative backlash to a Bud Light promotional campaign involving a transgender influencer led to a 30% drop in sales volume.  \nLeaders at BlackRock, Delta, Coca-Cola, Facebook, Google and Target, among other corporate titans, have recently become embroiled in similar culture-war debates. These sorts of controversies undermine businesses\u2019 strategy and sometimes their performance, often in lasting ways.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did we get here?\nAs longtime business school professors of strategic management, we wanted to understand why so many firestorms are now engulfing business leaders. In our recent research we developed a new theory, rooted in the realities of American politics, that provides a three-part answer. \nAmerican politics are increasingly dysfunctional\nFirst, many Americans think the American dream is out of reach. From middle-aged blue-collar workers to recent college graduates and beyond, people across American society are becoming increasingly disillusioned with the social contract. This has led to despair, jealousy and rising anger on both ends of the political spectrum.\nSecond, American political parties are using voters\u2019 disillusionment and anger to drive fundraising. Each party emphasizes divisive, emotional wedge issues \u2013 such as immigration or welfare spending \u2013 typically related to the social contract. For candidates, adhering to the party platform and demonizing the other party can pay off, at least in the short term.\nThis leads to what scholars call \u201caffective polarization,\u201d which spawns animosity toward those with opposing views and expands the distance between opposing policy positions.\nThis animosity makes democratic government less effective, particularly at a time when the two major parties are near parity in terms of power, resources and electoral outcomes. Congress frequently faces political gridlock, forcing Republican and Democratic presidents alike to rely on executive orders and federal agencies to get work done. When control of the presidency shifts to the other party, executive-branch policies swing one from extreme to another, too.\nWe believe that ineffective government and policy uncertainty have undermined the American dream. As a result, disillusioned people are increasingly turning for help to the only other institution with enough resources to tackle these challenges: business.\nThat\u2019s why companies have become the new nexus of political conflict and are facing pressure to take action on social justice, climate change and other issues that the government hasn\u2019t effectively addressed. Corporate actions that touch these issues frequently place firms in between two deeply divided groups with opposing agendas \u2013 potentially sparking big controversies.\nBusiness leadership is becoming more difficult\nThese issues are making executive positions far more challenging than they were just a decade ago. Culture-war firestorms can quickly overwhelm the conventional demands of setting and implementing business strategy. Executives must now spend substantial amounts of time, money and attention dealing with controversies.\nThis requires making new trade-offs. For example, research suggests that business investments that also benefit local stakeholders, such as communities and employees, get larger returns over the long term. But these investments are risky, because they lose value if the stakeholders refuse to cooperate later.\nFor example, Disney\u2019s theme parks and hotels in Florida are difficult to relocate, despite adverse shifts in state government policy. Similarly, Chick-fil-A\u2019s efforts to expand outside the American South were affected by opposition from politicians, as well as prospective employees and customers, over the founding family\u2019s religious views and public comments about the definition of marriage.\nIf the polarization limits firm growth, investment returns and job creation, it would naturally shrink economic opportunities for shareholders and employees, possibly undermining confidence in the American dream even more. At the same time, firms face growing demands to spend on social responsibility. In an era of ubiquitous social media, failing to address stakeholder concerns can produce negative publicity, boycotts and other forms of backlash that can erupt into firestorms that hurt financial performance. \nWhat\u2019s more, despite growing pressures for corporate social responsibility, it\u2019s not always profitable or even good for society. Because managers\u2019 attention is finite, responding to these demands distracts them from investments with more promising financial returns.\nManaging trade-offs in this combustible environment requires knowledge and skills that most executives don\u2019t yet have.\nWhat should business schools do?\nBusiness schools have been slow to prepare future executives for this new environment. Although business students usually learn about social responsibility, they generally don\u2019t learn about the causes of government gridlock and political polarization, or how to deal with divisive social issues.\nWhat\u2019s more, while some people criticize business schools for not teaching enough about emerging social issues that affect business, others assail universities for emphasizing these issues too much.\nFor now, business schools generally don\u2019t prioritize teaching about social contracts. Perhaps more importantly, they rarely explain how firms can strengthen democracy and effective government. \nWithout business schools seeking to understand and address these issues and providing new training, we believe that future executives may not understand the opportunities they have to arrest the downward spiral.\nUltimately, it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s interest to expand business school curricula to include the dynamics of social contract formation, the process of affective polarization, the causes of government ineffectiveness and the reasons why business has become a nexus of sociopolitical conflict.\nThe failure to understand and address these issues can undermine the innovation and wealth that democracy and capitalism together have wrought. With proper knowledge and training, however, we believe that executives will be better prepared to help restore the social contract and confidence in the American dream \u2013 or perhaps to help to create a new one.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Politics, Education, Economics, US politics, Risk, Business schools, Business school curriculum, MBA, American Dream, Social contract, Polarization, Business","role":"assistant"}]}

Good \u2014 but simply not good enough \u2014 coach Sheldon Keefe was first to go.\nReportedly, one or more of the Maple Leafs\u2019 Core Four \u2014 Captain John Tavares, Mitch Marner, Auston Matthews and William Nylander (plus Morgan Rielly) \u2014 may be next to go. However, there are issues \u2014 some practical and some philosophical \u2014 with that. \nEach of the Core Four have previously negotiated no-movement clauses. So, unless Tavares or Marner choose to waive (or are coerced to waive) their no-trade agreements, there\u2019s no trade.\nAs a result, pundits have suggested the Maple Leafs could (and perhaps even should) \u201cmake life rather miserable for him [Mitch Marner] in his last season in Toronto\u201d to nudge one or more of the Core Four to consider waiving their no-movement clauses. However, such hardball negotiation tactics are inadvisable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D negotiation\nHardball, or hard bargaining, tactics are inadvisable for several reasons. First, according to Harvard professors David Lax and James Sebenius, such coercive strategies and tactics are doomed to fail because they are (at best) short-term, short-sighted and fail to account for the interests and potential value that can only be created by looking beyond the immediate deal or issue.\nAccording to Lax and Sebenius, more effective three dimensional negotiators scan the environment \u201cin order to construct the most promising sequence of deals that lead to a self-sustaining company.\u201d 3D negotiators consider the impacts from their actions and how parties beyond the immediate issue can influence the deal and future deals as well.\nWhen it comes to the Core Four, the notion that the Maple Leafs should use coercive hardball tactics to nudge Tavares or Marner to waive their no-movement clauses fails to meet Lax and Sebenius\u2019 3D standard. It does not consider, for instance, how such tactics might influence future high-profile free agents\u2019 decisions to choose to join or stay with the Maple Leafs. \nAn Infinite Game\nAt Brock University\u2019s Department of Sport Management, perhaps the most important lesson learned through our negotiation workshops concerns the Infinite Game concept. In short, infinite games are continuous (life, business, relationships, etc.) and as such, should be played with an elevated ethical code.\nWhereas in finite games, you might consider lying or cheating if doing so increases your odds of winning, an infinite game demands more \u2014 because to stay in the game you have to consider how decisions will effect your reputation and whether people trust you. \n\nYet, negotiations (even negotiation simulations) provide a platform, or moments, that can test students\u2019 willingness to trade short-term gains for long-term trust. For example, student-negotiators can be tempted to suggest their best alternative to a proposed deal (whatever that deal happens to be) is better than it is.\nSo as not to make these same mistakes in your next salary negotiation (e.g., by suggesting to your boss that you have several offers from competing companies when you don\u2019t), do the necessary work to actually obtain your best alternatives. \nThe lesson \u2014 that negotiation in the sport management arena is an infinite game \u2014 can be reinforced by conducting multiple simulations in which negotiating partners alternate roles with each side having an obvious advantage over the other. \nIn those situations, advantaged student-negotiators who (wrongly) assumed they were playing a finite game in the first simulation are often surprised to learn how taking advantage of their partner comes back to haunt them in the second round.\nThe Core Four conundrum\nMaple Leafs leadership has important decisions to make. First, is whether to adopt 3D negotiation principles, including seeing beyond the current negotiation table to ensure decisions made now don\u2019t negatively impact future deals. \nSecond, is whether to treat the Core Four conundrum as a finite or an infinite game. Hardball tactics that make life miserable for the Core Four may be deemed an acceptable (though unethical) part of the game.\nHowever, viewed as an infinite game, the situation demands the Maple Leafs leadership team live up to their word (and the word of previous leaders) on negotiated agreements with no-movement clauses. Anything less is simply not good enough.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Sport, Sports, Hockey, Athletes, National Hockey League (NHL), ice hockey, Hockey in Canada, toronto maple leafs, Negotiation tactics","role":"assistant"}]}

In 1968, IBM \u2013 a company that now covers its logo in a rainbow flag each June for Pride Month \u2013 fired Conway when she expressed her intention to transition. She died on June 9, 2024 at age 86. IBM eventually apologized to the now-famous computing expert, but only 52 years later, when Conway was 82 years old.\nAlthough Conway\u2019s start as a trans woman while at IBM was inauspicious, she quickly found a new job under her post-transition name and identity at the prestigious Xerox PARC and for many years kept the fact that she was trans from her employers to avoid being unfairly dismissed again. In so doing, Conway escaped becoming a target of the sensationalistic and harmful news coverage about trans people that dominated mainstream media in the 20th century. At the same time, however, this meant she was also not able to fully tell her story.\nEven today, mainstream media coverage of trans people often positions them as unfortunate victims or questions trans people\u2019s right to exist at all.\nThrough her groundbreaking work on chip design, Conway joined a long line of illustrious women in computing in the 20th century who made computers into the powerful and flexible tools that they are today. Conway\u2019s co-invention of very large-scale integration, or VLSI, rocketed chip design into the future. VLSI allowed etching circuits on a computer chip\u2019s surface to be as space efficient as possible, ensuring the maximum number of transistors on a chip.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaximizing the number of transistors on a chip meant that the resulting computer using that chip could be as fast and powerful as possible. For this innovation, Conway received industry and academic recognition. However, that recognition was long delayed.\nThe \u2018Conway Effect\u2019\nLike many other women in computing, however, Conway felt that she had been denied her due credit because of the way that her male co-inventor of VLSI, Carver Mead, was repeatedly given more credit and incorrectly perceived as the lead on the project that led to this important innovation. Although Mead did not necessarily seek to unfairly take credit for himself, what Conway dubbed the Conway Effect led to him getting more, or sometimes all, of the credit. \nThe Conway Effect is a slightly modified version of what is known as the Mathilda Effect: Women\u2019s scientific contributions are often attributed to the nearest man working on the same topic. The Conway Effect states that people who are \u201cothered\u201d in computing, including women and people of color of all genders, form a group that society does not expect to make great advances, and so they are not given full credit when they do because they are literally overlooked.\nConway pointed out that, after some initial recognition together, Mead was given sole awards for their joint work, as well as being celebrated along with other men at the Computer History Museum in Silicon Valley. She and other women who had done the same work, even when they were in leadership positions, were not invited or similarly recognized. \nConway wrote about her experience in the essay where she introduced the \u201cConway Effect.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, my disappearance was complete after the Computer History Museum\u2019s gala celebration of the 50th anniversary of the integrated circuit. Sixteen men were described by the media as \u201cthe Valley\u2019s founding fathers.\u201d They were inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame for their contributions to microelectronics. Top billing went to Gordon Moore and Carver Mead. I was not invited to the event, and didn\u2019t even know it was happening.\n\nConway was added to the Computer History Museum in 2014, 12 years after Mead. Even how the computing field refers to their innovation as the \u201cMead-Conway method,\u201d with Mead\u2019s name first despite not being first alphabetically, shows this unfortunate effect.\n\nOut and into a new role\nConway worked and lived quietly for much of her career, making important strides that reshaped the field of computing while trying not to out herself as a trans woman working in a conservative industry. Later in her life, she realized that the low profile she had sought to keep would be untenable if her career were to make it into the history books, which it eventually did. She also wanted to take credit for her earlier, pre-transition innovations. \nAs a result, in 1999 she came out publicly as trans and became a vocal supporter of trans rights and of other trans people in high tech. She kept a detailed website that talked about her trans experience in order to try to help other trans people, especially trans women on the verge of coming out, feel less alone. She even participated in a version of \u201cThe Vagina Monologues\u201d in 2004 that starred trans women. \nDespite Conway\u2019s earliest career setback, which nearly cost her both her livelihood and her family, she went on to have an illustrious career in computing. Her assessment of both her place and the place of other women in the field continues to teach us an important lesson about gender and computing \u2013 just as the chip architecture that she co-designed continues to shape what is possible for people to do with the computers that shape our work and personal lives.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Discrimination, Transgender, Technology, Gender bias, Computing, Women in STEM, LGBTQI+, History of computing, Computer chips","role":"assistant"}]}

But, in reality, specialists have a good grasp of what most historical objects were created for. But there are a few  exceptions to this rule. \nThe following list is a selection of intriguing mystery objects. They\u2019re a great example of why digging up the past continues to hold great fascination for professionals and public alike.\n1. Neolithic stone balls\nThe elaborately carved stone balls found predominantly in Scotland and dating from the later Neolithic period (circa BC3200-2500) are one such mystery.\nOver 425 balls have been found. They are generally the size of a cricket ball and made from a wide variety of stones. Their surfaces are sculpted, sometimes into raised circular discs and sometimes with deep incisions defining knobs and lobes in high relief. Decoration takes the form of spirals or concentric shapes, echoing those found on pottery and monumental stones of the era. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome have been found in burials, others in settlements. They are rarely, if ever, identical and most are found alone, so don\u2019t seem to have been part of a set. Some appear to have been heavily handled during their lifetime.\nThe original use of these stone balls has been a source of much debate, right back to their earliest discovery in the 19th century. Many were chance finds or circulated with little provenance in art collections, and have rarely been found in an archaeological context. \nWere they missiles for deterring predators and pests? Weapons of war? Toys? Or perhaps measuring weights, household ornaments, mnemonic devices, ball bearings to move megaliths or holders for yarn? The answer still escapes us.\n\n2. Roman dodecahedra\nThese intriguing objects have recently made headlines, with a new find from Norton Disney in Lincolnshire prompting much discussion as to their function. \n\nDodecahedra date from the Roman period in Britain (43-410AD). About 130 have been found across the north-west provinces of the former Roman empire, each finely crafted from copper alloy. \nNo representations of these objects are known in ancient art or literature. They do not conform to a standard size and rarely show use-wear which could hint at their purpose. Although armchair experts will tell you their granny used one to knit gloves, archaeologists are undecided on their intended use.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Beautifully crafted Roman dodecahedron discovered in Lincoln \u2013 but what were they for?\n\n\n\n\n3. Neolithic chalk drums\nIn 1889, three carved cylinders of chalk were discovered in a child\u2019s grave in Folkton, north Yorkshire. The Folkton Chalk Drums have geometric decoration and what appear to be eyes, noses and eyebrows. A fourth, undecorated drum was found at Lavant in west Sussex in 1993. Another, highly ornate, example was excavated at Burton Agnes in east Yorkshire in 2015. \nThe Burton Agnes drum was buried with a chalk ball, a bone pin and the remains of three children \u2013 one of whom was dated to BC3005-2890.\n\nThe motifs on the drums are part of an aesthetic tradition also found on the Neolithic stone balls. Despite their name, chalk drums are unlikely to have been played as musical instruments and do not show wear associated with percussive use. \nSome researchers have connected their circumferences with a standardised measure of length known as the \u201clong foot\u201d. Some think they were references in stone to perishable containers such as lidded wooden jars or baskets. Others have tried to link the geometric markings to astronomical observations. But their presence in the graves of carefully buried children seems to suggest a more sensitive explanation.\n4. Bronze age \u201clock-rings\u201d\nThe bronze age was a time of exceptional gold-working. Highly decorative personal ornaments were crafted from gold sheet and wire. These small penannular (open) rings date from the late bronze age (circa BC1000-800) and are found in Ireland, Britain and parts of France. \nFrequently unearthed in matching pairs, they can be plain or have delicate, geometric engravings.\n\nRecent interpretations have suggested they could have been nose rings, earrings or hair ornaments. None of these explanations is terribly satisfactory, as various elements of their design would make the rings difficult or uncomfortable to wear. \nWhat we need is context \u2013 like the recent discoveries at Boncuklu Tarla, in Turkey, of burials with facial jewellery found close to skulls.\n5. Romano-British cosmetic grinders\nCosmetic grinders are small copper alloy kits made in two parts. One half is the \u201cmortar\u201d (a long and curving grooved receptacle) and the other is the \u201cpestle\u201d (either rod-like and pointed, or arched into a \u201crocker\u201d shape). They often have loops for suspension and human or animal-shaped terminals. \nWaterbirds and bovids are common decorative motifs which also feature on other Romano-British containers such as cups and buckets. Phallic symbolism on some sets has prompted an association with fertility.\nCosmetic sets are typically British, and rarely found on mainland Europe.

It enables people to become parents to a child who is given a second chance at being part of a loving family. And a birth mother is relieved of a burden she was either unprepared for, or unable to carry. \nMother and child are later reunited, and joy ensues, happy endings all round. A nice story, right? Yes it is, and one can see why telecommunications giant One NZ chose to capitalise on the redemptive power of these adoption tropes with its \u201cLet\u2019s Get Connected\u201d advertising campaign. \nAfter all, closed adoption represents the epitome of disconnection for adopted people and their birth families. Under the current law, birth identity and relationships are legally erased while new adoptive identities and relationships are created. \nSo far, we have only seen one \u201cepisode\u201d in what is clearly an ongoing story in the campaign. But for a number of us who have experienced adoption directly, this first episode all too easily glosses over the pain and loss at the heart of adoption. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFantasy and reality\nUntil the Adult Adoption Information Act was passed in 1985, many adopted people in Aotearoa New Zealand were raised with little or no information regarding their birth origins. They had to wait until age 20 to access their original birth certificate. \nSo, for adopted people, the promise of connection is particularly poignant \u2013 as the advertisement depicts.\nThe \u201cplot\u201d of the One NZ campaign is unusual, however, in that it centres on a transracial adoptive family who have apparently not disclosed or discussed adoption. This is despite it being plainly apparent from the physical differences between the M\u0101ori son and his very P\u0101keh\u0101 adoptive parents. \nIn real life, such late or non-disclosure of adoption and whakapapa would be unethical and out of step with current adoption realities or good practice. The fact this and other aspects of the adoptive experience are depicted for comic effect is deeply insensitive to those directly affected. \nThe adoptive parents in this scenario assure their son that biology makes no difference \u2013 except it does. For many adopted people, even if we are loved and cared for by the parents who adopted us, such assertions don\u2019t negate our interest and investment in knowing our biological origins. \nIt is also our right, and something we should be free to decide the significance of, irrespective of the feelings or perspectives of others. Research shows that when adoptive parents deny the importance of biology, and the differences adoption can make, this can result in negative outcomes for adopted people. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      'Nobody's child' \u2013 despite a compelling case for reform, NZ's adoption laws remain stuck in the past\n\n\n\n\nChanging the adoption narrative\nThe son at the centre of the One NZ campaign clearly does feel this tug. His quest for origins drives the narrative forward. \nThe vital clue to his parentage lies in a stone given to him by his unknown mother. He carries it around the world, asking random strangers if they know its provenance. The implication being, find the source of the stone, find my mother. \nIt is an advertisement, of course, and not an objective depiction of reality. But this portrayal also belies the angst and anguish that can often accompany an adoptee\u2019s decision to search \u2013 let alone the vulnerability of approaching potential family members. The fear of rejection looms large for many adopted people.\nA particularly jarring aspect of the advertisement is the birth mother\u2019s recollection of the moment of her son\u2019s conception: a fast-cut sequence of abandon and surprise, played for laughs.\nIn fact, our birth mothers carried us for nine months, and were then faced with the difficulty \u2013 often under pressure or coercion, and in a hostile and judgemental environment \u2013 of having to give us up to strangers. The pain of this is long-lasting, for mothers and adopted children.\nFor the many of us who are adopted, the commodification of these experiences to sell products and services will hit differently. \nIt may be that the campaign moves on to reflect some of those harder and more complex realities, which persist despite attempts to challenge and change that narrative. We will wait and see.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Advertising, Adoption, Adoption laws","role":"assistant"}]}

The plan is to knock down and rebuild 44 large public housing towers in Melbourne. The government says these towers, built in the 1960s and \u201970s, are no longer fit for purpose and will cost more to maintain and upgrade than to replace. \nRebuilding will allow 20,000 more people to live on these sites. However, most of the extra housing will be for private renters or owners. It will not add much more public or affordable housing. \nRebuilding involves breaking up public housing communities. Many tenants have already been forcibly displaced. Removing stock from the system to make way for future housing reduces the capacity to house people in need amid a housing crisis.\nTearing down so much concrete and other materials and rebuilding in a carbon-constrained world also raises concerns about the public value for money and the loss of embodied carbon in these old buildings. The materials and energy needed to erect a new building create a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. Construction produces almost a fifth of Australia\u2019s emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome industry experts say the housing towers are structurally sound. They and other sustainability researchers argue that retrofits can bring the buildings up to modern standards.  \nThis approach would improve thermal comfort, cut energy bills and produce fewer emissions. Some retrofitted buildings could have half the embodied energy of newly built ones. And communities could largely remain in place while the work is done. \nPublic housing complexes across Australia face similar renewal proposals. In each case, there are valid questions about the balance of public and private benefit. \nSo, how should decisions on public housing account for environmental, social and economic costs and benefits for all the people and interests involved? We draw on our recent research on life-cycle impacts and public housing tenant relocations to answer this question. Our research shows decisions on each tower that are underpinned by a proper process \u2013 one that considers all the evidence \u2013 could go either way: demolish and rebuild, or retrofit. \n\nWhat are the options for ageing buildings?\nBroadly, there are three options for older high-rise housing:\n\nmaintain\nretrofit\nknock down and rebuild.\n\nThe first option is increasingly unviable. This is because of the urgent need to decarbonise our building stock and the impacts of decades of under-maintenance on such buildings. \nIn 2017, the Auditor-General\u2019s Office found  the Victorian government lacked the capacity to \u201creliably assess the condition of its stock, and consequently whether it is deteriorating at a rate faster than it is ageing\u201d. Maintaining the current stock, while not knowing its condition, would require a massive policy shift and repair effort. \nThat leaves us with retrofits or demolition and rebuilding. The government has chosen the third option for all 44 towers.  \nThe table below sums up the broader costs and benefits of demolition and rebuilding. \n\nThere has been pushback against the impacts on housing tower communities since the  plans were announced last September. Two towers are already empty. Other tenants will be relocated in the coming year.\nTenants claim their human rights were not considered and launched a class action in the Victorian Supreme Court. The action was recently dismissed, but the judge allowed for a revised argument to be put forward in the future. \nThe table below shows the costs and benefits of retrofitting. Clearly, for each project, there\u2019s a lot to consider in deciding on the best option. \n\nCurrent decision-making is skewed\nProposals for public high-rise buildings often focus on direct, short-term economic costs and benefits. Typically, the equation centres on the costs of retaining buildings versus the windfalls from redevelopment, such as unlocking the latent value of land. \nProposed changes to the site, such as providing more dwellings and shifting management of public housing to non-government landlords, often alter this equation. Amid a housing crisis, housing supply is understandably high on the policy agenda. Decision-makers often neglect the environmental and social impacts. \nResearch has found retrofitting reduces embodied carbon, waste and other environmental impacts by up to 50% compared to rebuilding. \nOn top of this are the social impacts of redevelopment that demolishes people\u2019s homes and breaks up communities. This leads to poorer health, economic and social outcomes for public housing tenants. \nIn considering all these impacts, the lack of publicly available information on the government\u2019s decision-making is a glaring problem. This comes back to process. \nIn particular, there\u2019s a need for transparency about the metrics and evidence used to make decisions, and for accountability for those decisions. At a minimum, independently verified studies of the environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits over the buildings\u2019 life cycle should be made public before decisions are made. \n\nRetrofitting is a viable option\nThere are a number of examples where older high-rise housing has been retained and improved. \nFor example, in the Cit\u00e9 du Grand Parc in France, 530 apartments in three blocks needed renovation once demolition was ruled out. In this case, sustainability considerations held sway. \nAs well as improving the interior, winter gardens and balconies were added. This work extended living spaces and provided more natural light. \nThe award-winning project was planned so residents didn\u2019t have to move out. Each flat was completed in around 12 to 16 days.\nCloser to home, not-for-profit design agency OFFICE found the Victorian government could save more than A$88 million by refurbishing and including infill development rather than rebuilding the Barak Beacon public housing estate in Port Melbourne. Some 238 social housing dwellings could be added around the existing buildings.\nThe OFFICE report estimated not having to relocate the community would save $16 million. This approach could also reduce embodied energy by 54% and impacts of land use to produce building materials by 273%.\nThe Victorian government\u2019s plans intensify the twin challenges of overcoming housing shortages and decarbonising buildings. As Australia\u2019s high-rise housing stock ages, we need a co-ordinated, accountable and fair process for deciding the future of these buildings. This means balancing environmental, social, health and economic costs and benefits across all affected people and interests, based on the best information available.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Affordable housing, Public housing, Housing policy, Urban renewal, embodied carbon, High-rise apartments, urban redevelopment, construction costs, Building emissions, Better Cities, Construction waste","role":"assistant"}]}

The 1964 musical gives audiences a window into Yiddish-speaking, rural Jewish life in 19th-century Europe.\nFor many people, this image represents Jewish history as a whole. When most Americans think of Jews, they think of Ashkenazi Jews: a term that refers to people of eastern and northern European Jewish culture. In American culture, Ashkenazi Jews are represented by cultural icons ranging from Tevye the dairyman and Yente the matchmaker in \u201cFiddler\u201d to comedians Woody Allen and Sarah Silverman and author Philip Roth.\nWhile Ashkenazi Jews do make up the majority of American Jews, the Jewish world is much more diverse that this picture suggests \u2013 including in the United States. The diversity of American Jews is a major focus of my own research: both through my current project, Jews of Color: Histories and Futures, and in my book about interfaith families, \u201cBeyond Chrismukkah.\u201d\n\nFrom Iberia to the world\nDescriptions of Jewish life often divide communities up into three main groups: Ashkenazi, Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpain and Portugal expelled Jewish inhabitants in the late 1400s, sending refugees fleeing around the Mediterranean and further north in Europe. Called Sephardi or Sephardic Jews, these people settled in North Africa, the Ottoman Empire, France, Italy and the Balkans, as well as Britain and the Netherlands.\nAt times, the term \u201cSephardi\u201d is used to describe any number of other communities who are not Ashkenazi, even if they have no connection to the Iberian Peninsula: from Persian Jews and Kurdish Jews to Bukharan Jews of Central Asia, Beta Israel Jews in Ethiopia, and Cochin Jews in India.\nSephardic Jews often have different customs than Ashkenazi Jews, including melodies for prayers, foods and forms of observance. For instance, all Jews avoid \u201cchametz\u201d during the holiday of Passover: leavened food made with wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. Sephardic tradition, however, permits another category of food, \u201ckitnyot\u201d \u2013 rice, legumes and corn \u2013 which is traditionally forbidden to Ashkenazi Jews.\nNew word, old communities\nThe third category, Mizrahi, means \u201ceastern\u201d in Hebrew. It is a relatively new term, but describes communities with centuries of history. Hundreds of thousands of Jews from places other than Europe moved to Israel during the state\u2019s early years in the mid-20th century. These groups \u2013 from Moroccan, Iraqi, Egyptian, Syrian and \u201cYemenite\u201d communities, among others \u2013 came to be referred to as Mizrahi.\n\nSome people in the U.S. identify as Mizrahi Jews, and there have been Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews in the U.S. since the Colonial period.\nAshkenazi Jews make up the majority of American Jews today. Sephardic Jews were the most influential Jewish group during the Colonial period, however. Most of the oldest synagogues in the U.S. were built according to Sephardic customs.\nJews of color\nIn addition to these broader categories, 5% to 15% of American Jews identify as Jews of color. Surveys of the Jewish community have been notoriously bad at asking questions about race, so it is hard to pinpoint the exact the racial makeup. But researchers know that more and more Jews identify as Jews of color.\nJews of color are stunningly diverse. Some are descendants of communities that have always been Jewish and have never been considered \u201cwhite\u201d in America \u2013 like the painter Siona Benjamin, a member of India\u2019s Bene Israel Jewish community who now lives in the U.S.\n\nOther Jews of color are children of interfaith marriage. A number of celebrities fit this description, including actor Daveed Diggs, actress Rashida Jones, rapper Drake and feminist writer Rebecca Walker. Similarly, Angela Buchdahl, the first Asian American to be ordained as a rabbi, is the child of an Ashkenazi Jewish father and a Korean Buddhist mother. \nStill other Jews of color were adopted into Jewish families. Children with non-Jewish birth parents are usually formally converted to Judaism, often at the time of adoption. As Ashkenazi Jews make up the majority of American Jews, these children are usually adopted into homes that reflect Ashkenazi approaches to Jewish life.\nAs is true of all adoptions, families make a range of choices about whether to include their children\u2019s birth culture in their upbringing, and how. Families are often more comfortable infusing elements of Buddhism into their Jewish homes, for example, than including aspects of Christian or Muslim cultures.\nChoosing Judaism\nMultiracial and adopted Jewish children\u2019s experiences vary, of course, but they often encounter challenges as they grow up and move away from their familiar childhood synagogues and Jewish groups. As adults in new Jewish communities, some of them find their Jewish identity is more frequently questioned than in spaces where everyone knew them and their families. \nMany Jews of color report that people often assume that they converted to Judaism as adults. Certainly, some Jews of color have \u2013 perhaps most famously, the musician Sammy Davis, Jr. A more contemporary high-profile example is Michael Twitty, an African American Jewish food historian and cookbook author. \n\nConverts often feel expected to explain themselves and their motivations, though Jewish law forbids calling attention to someone\u2019s conversion. In addition, the reality remains that the majority of Jews of color are not converts to Judaism.\n\u2018What brings you here?\u2019\nAs much Jewish diversity as there is, much of it is invisible to the wider world, even the wider Jewish world.\nMany people assume that \u201cthe\u201d Jewish experience is the Ashkenazi experience. Therefore, they also assume that Jews are white. There have been times in American history when white Americans have considered Jews as racial outsiders. However, most race-based laws in the U.S. have treated Jews of European heritage as white, which has given them legal protections and economic advantages not available to other American minority groups. \nThis assumption that the real Jewish experience is Ashkenazi is called \u201cAshkenormativity.\u201d Like any culture, Ashkenazi culture has many wonderful things: Bagels! Matzo ball soup! Yiddish theater! Klezmer music! Really beautiful prayer melodies and really acerbic humor! Yet Ashkenormativity can be a problem.\nFirst of all, the rich traditions of those other Jewish cultures can be marginalized \u2013 or exoticized, if they are included at all. More importantly, the assumption that Jews are Ashkenazi and white can make Jews of color feel unwelcome or unsafe. \nI was recently at a synagogue dinner with three other visitors. I am Indian American, and the others were white. Total strangers asked about my heritage, and when I revealed that I am not from an Indian Jewish community, they asked if I was, in fact, Jewish.\nMeanwhile, the hosts simply assumed the other guests were Jewish, and tried to recruit them to join the synagogue. This happened despite the fact that the people at our table had already heard me say the blessings over the wine and bread, in Hebrew, without looking at the printed prayers. \nMy story is annoying, but other people, particularly Black Jews, have stories of being followed around in synagogues because people assumed they did not belong. In a world of rising antisemitism, synagogues are increasing security \u2013 but sometimes without thinking about how that affects the safety and comfort of their members of color.\nThere is a huge diversity of viewpoints and experiences among white Jews. Jews of color bring additional perspectives on everything from racial justice issues to the current war in the Middle East. Remembering that full diversity can help us remember to see American Jews not as a narrow demographic, but as a kaleidoscope.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Spain, India, Portugal, Judaism, Diversity, American Jews, Jewish culture, Religion and society, Sephardic Jews, Ashkenazi Jews, Mizrahim","role":"assistant"}]}

In addition to photo ops at theme parks and falling into lakes, Davey has put out a more serious party election broadcast featuring his personal story of caring for his teenage son John, who is disabled. \nCarers hold communities and families together at great personal, emotional and financial cost, yet their contributions are often invisible to, and unrecognised by, others. In addition to making carers more visible by highlighting his story, Davey has pledged that the Lib Dems would address the unmet financial and support needs of the country\u2019s millions of unpaid carers. \nThis authentic and celebratory image of male caregiving is, sadly, unusual in politics. It sets Davey apart from the other main party leaders in this campaign, and is a refreshing change to politicians posing in highly masculinised images \u2013 such as wearing hard hats and hi-vis jackets on construction sites. \nShowing and celebrating that men care \u2013 and presenting positive public images of what men do for family \u2013 is vital to wider societal wellbeing and health. My research shows that when men can invest more time and energy in family life, this has benefits for them, for mothers and for children. \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lib Dems have pledged to be the \u201cvoice of carers\u201d, and are acknowledging that male care should be part of this conversation. The social care system in the UK is collapsing and becoming more expensive, leaving millions unable to access the care they need. This means that many more people have taken on unpaid caring responsibilities without adequate support.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why the UK really does need a clear plan to fix adult social care\n\n\n\n\nSupport for male caregiving is also important for equality between genders and generations. There have been positive shifts over time in gendered attitudes around the roles and responsibilities of men and women. But much of the western world still associates unpaid care labour with women and employment with men. \nThese more traditional, historically persistent associations risk spilling into problematic assumptions that men don\u2019t take on caring responsibilities, or even that they are uniformly uncaring as a group.\nThis rather unhelpful view does two things. First, it obscures the diverse ways that many men engage in caregiving in their day-to-day lives. And second, it contributes to stubborn work-care inequalities between men and women. Women are still more likely to carry the triple burden of domestic work, care work and paid employment.\n\nPolicy promises for carers\nDebates about the imbalance between work and care for women and men often emphasise the barriers (and potential solutions) to women\u2019s participation in the labour market. Women want more flexible work policies \u2013 and available, accessible and affordable childcare to be able to work, as well as parent. Men and boys would benefit from these changes too, particularly for men pursuing a better work-life balance.\nMen want more time with family and to be more involved in their children\u2019s lives. But this is often restricted by the shadow of outdated cultural views about gender roles, the fatherhood penalty in workplaces (the bias men experience in seeking part-time or flexible roles), and ungenerous parental leave for male carers. \nThere is evidence that father-focused policies such as extended paternity leave could sway voters. Yet these remain largely ignored by the main political parties. \nThe Lib Dems have pledged to immediately increase the Carer\u2019s Allowance from \u00a381.90 to \u00a3101.90 per week. This, Davey, said, would boost the incomes of family carers by \u00a31,040 a year. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Lib Dem proposals take social care reform seriously \u2013 but doubts remain over how they'd pay for it\n\n\n\n\nThis is partly a response to the overpayment scandal. Thousands of carers have been inadvertently overpaid their carers allowance, and the government is now requiring them to pay this back, pushing many into debt.\n\nFor low-income families and those caring for family members with disabilities, there are also welcome pledges in the Lib Dem manifesto to address mental health and special educational needs and disabilities support, and provisions to scrap the two-child benefit limit and bedroom tax \u2013 both of which reduce financial support to carers. \nIn highlighting the experiences and needs of family carers, the Lib Dems are distinctively acknowledging that being able to care, supported by an effective infrastructure and welfare system, is sorely needed to fix the current care crisis. \nSo far, the two main parties have continued to express caution in their election campaigns over benefits changes for families, and there has been limited attention to the costs of social care.\nSo, as someone who researches fatherhood, it is refreshing to see a public celebration of male caregiving by a political figure, matched with policy intentions. Caring is a core function of human life and experience, not to mention the economy. Questions about who cares, how we care, and how care is funded are crucial for any new government to answer.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Unpaid care, Liberal Democrats, Carers, Ed Davey, Caregiving, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

Diagnostic tests, therapies and treatments all go through lengthy, expensive trials to make sure they\u2019re safe and effective before being approved for public use. The gold standard for clinical trials \u2014 randomized controlled studies \u2014 often require thousands of research subjects.\nSociety generally agrees such effort is necessary. Our medical system is built on evidence and trust, and reliable research is essential to both.\nAs a professor of medicine and a researcher with an interest in ethnic variation and health, I have reflected on who is included and who is left out of clinical trials. Unfortunately, clinical trials all too often fail to reflect the communities that stand to be most affected by the outcomes of that research.\nUnder-representation in clinical trials\nThe underrepresented of racialized, or non-white, people in clinical trials is a serious and largely unrecognized problem that needs more scrutiny as part of the growing movement to foster health equity.\n\n\n\n\n\nLike other broad efforts to build a fairer, more inclusive society, there is an ongoing movement toward health equity \u2014 the effort to assure every person in society has equal access to health care.\nThere are multiple reports that show the majority of studies of genetic variants linked to Type 2 diabetes focused on higher-income white people of European background, whereas diabetes is more frequent in non-white ethnic groups. That led my colleagues and me to wonder if the same might be true of clinical trials for Type 2 diabetes treatments.\n\nIt turns out it was. That\u2019s a significant concern, given that about 422 million people worldwide \u2014 roughly one in 20 \u2014 have diabetes, which disproportionately affects non-white ethnic populations such as South Asian, East Asian, Indigenous and Black people. The number of cases and the prevalence of diabetes have been steadily increasing for decades. \nMy research colleagues and I looked at 20 years\u2019 worth of data for our January paper in the journal Diabetologia, and found that in diabetes-related clinical trials, there is a clear difference between the pool of research subjects and the populations statistically more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.\nWhile racialized, or non-white, populations carry a heavier burden of diabetes, the body of research subjects enrolled in Type 2 diabetes trials is disproportionately white. \nWe analyzed 83 studies that took place between 2000 and 2020, involving 283,000 research subjects. We found racialized people were somewhat under-represented in government-funded research and significantly under-represented in industry-funded research relative to the distribution of diabetes by ethnicity or race in the regions being studied.\nThe differences between government- and industry-funded study subjects may be attributable to government guidelines that call for proportional representation by gender, ethnicity and racial groups. In industry-funded research, there\u2019s not much regulation at all in terms of ethnic diversity.\nIt isn\u2019t necessarily racism \u2014 at least not direct, overt racism \u2014 that drives this dynamic. The answer is likely more banal: habit and convenience. Physicians who recruit research subjects for studies, as they often do, are likely to lean on the same patients they\u2019ve recruited before, and their research co-ordinators are more likely to seek patients in local hospitals and clinics. \nMy study discusses how this reliance on traditional recruitment tools, such as posters in English in hospitals and clinics inviting people to volunteer, without considering the distribution of the disease of interest by ethnicity, leads to over-represention of white European participants, as there is no specific plan to engage high-risk communities. \nBeing motivated to collect data as quickly and efficiently as possible, pharmaceutical companies also usually go to clinical or academic research organizations they\u2019ve worked with before. They generally recruit in ways they\u2019ve used previously, which typically nets them higher-income, white European subjects.\nResearchers may also avoid traditionally underrepresented groups, believing they don\u2019t want to participate in research, when research in North America and England shows people from such groups would like to participate in research but are rarely asked. \nDoes underrepresentation affect results?\n\nOne may wonder whether the failure to balance the pool of diabetes research participants twists the results. The short answer is that in general, it likely does not.\nWhile there is a genetic component to diabetes, we know from other research that physiologically speaking, people are more often similar in terms of responding to disease and to treatments, so the drugs we prescribe are legitimately effective.\nHowever, detecting ethnic differences in serious adverse reactions to experimental drugs is more difficult because they are less frequent. Some may occur more frequently in ethnically diverse groups due to differences in the frequency of genetic variants or physiologic responses, leaving some vulnerable to hidden problems that a more diversified clinical trial participant pool could have exposed.\nA broader problem is trust. We know racialized people are less likely to trust the medical system, all too often with good reason. Participating in trials would allow racialized people to develop a greater sense of inclusion and control \u2014 and feel they are players in the medical system, not outsiders to structures that have historically excluded or even abused them. Improving trust encourages more people to seek medical help when they need it. \nThe person who hesitates to seek care because of mistrust is more likely to develop more severe symptoms. A cancer discovered sooner rather than later is typically easier to treat. A diabetic who receives care earlier is far less likely to need a toe or limb amputation later. \nEven a small improvement in the percentage of racialized people who seek care and receive effective therapies can make a significant difference in the overall health of the population and the total cost of health care. The Institute of Medicine in the United States found that closing the health equity gap by just one per cent would reduce health-care costs by billions of dollars. \nRecruiting representative study participants\nThe way to fix this problem is to require and fund researchers to recruit ethnically diverse participants that more closely resemble the demographic makeup of Canada, or distribution of disease by ethnic group. Government-funded research grants can be tagged to requirements for disease proportional recruitment, and corporate-funded research should be required by government regulators to show evidence of the same.\nSpecifically targeting underrepresented populations to build an appropriately representative pool of participants takes more effort, time and money, so it rarely happens, especially when funding is already tight.\nWithout a better understanding of the consequences of unbalanced recruiting, and stricter regulations to enforce it, many sponsors and researchers will continue take the path of least resistance to get their study numbers.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Diabetes, Type 2 diabetes, Equity, Clinical trials, Diversity, Health equity, Representation, Drug testing, Drug approval, race and health","role":"assistant"}]}

Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we\u2019ll fact check the claims being made. \nSign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nLabour has stated it will tackle these retention issues by reviewing the structure of retention payments. This is consistent with Rishi Sunak\u2019s tax-free bonus of up to \u00a330,000 over the first five years of teachers\u2019 careers in subjects with a particular shortage \u2013 something the Conservatives have also pledged to extend in their manifesto.\nBut these policies fail to address the underlying truth \u2013 that teaching has become a less attractive profession due to declining pay and a more challenging job. \nThe Department for Education has persistently failed to recruit and retain the teachers needed to ensure that schools are appropriately staffed \u2013 and the issues are only getting worse. This year, only half of initial teacher training targets for England were met for secondary schools. New data from a National Foundation For Educational Research survey shows the number of teachers in England who are considering leaving increased by 44% on the previous year.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why UK government policies have failed to recruit enough teachers for years\n\n\n\n\nSince 2010, experienced teachers in England have experienced a real-terms reduction in salaries of up to 13%. During the same period, average earnings across all sectors in Britain have increased by 2.5% in real terms. To put this into perspective, my research estimates that one in three teachers would be financially better off in another profession.\nWhile the financial returns have declined, the job has gotten more challenging. Since the pandemic, teachers\u2019 workloads and job quality have worsened compared with other professions. This decline in the relative attractiveness of teaching has serious implications for the quality, quantity and diversity of the profession. \n\nMaking teaching pay\nLabour claims it will raise  \u00a31.5 billion by applying VAT and business rates to private schools. Assuming this figure is accurate, it could be used to give teachers in England a 10% pay rise (approximately \u00a31.4 billion). Not only would this go a long way to reversing their real-terms reduction in salaries since 2010 (13%), it would also be a great statement of change. \nAnother plausible option could be a performance-based reduction in tuition fees for university-led teacher training programmes, a policy which has found success internationally. In the UK, this would be both less expensive than an equivalent bursary scheme, and more effective.\nThe failure to make teaching more attractive could have serious implications. Education plays a crucial role in economic prosperity. As teachers are the biggest school-level determinant in educational outcomes, the persistent decline in the relative attractiveness of the profession endangers the prosperity of future generations \u2013 with widespread consequences for unemployment, poverty, social exclusion and the financial sustainability of social security systems. \nAs things stand, Labour\u2019s approach to the recruitment and retention crisis is consistent with the Conservative approach: trying to fill a leaky bucket with a tablespoon, and not good enough.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Teachers, Labour manifesto, UK Schools, teacher recruitment, Keir Starmer, Educate me, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

According to a quick count by the country\u2019s electoral commission, Mexican voters have just elected their first female president. In a society that has long treated its women unfavourably, it is a seismic shift.\nHowever, the country\u2019s president-elect, Claudia Sheinbaum, inherits a very challenging responsibility. The second-best performing economy in Latin America risks being overwhelmed by cartel criminality, the growing threat of narco-politics, and surging violence against women.\nTo give a flavour of the scale of violence in the country, Mexico has seen more than 30,000 murders per year for five years straight. And the total number of people that have gone missing in Mexico since records began in 1962 now exceeds 100,000 \u2013 though, in reality, this figure may be far higher. \nMany have argued that the spiralling violence has much to do with outgoing president Andr\u00e9s Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s hands-off security policy. His reconciliatory message that he would support an agreement with some of the nation\u2019s most powerful and violent cartels in order to stop the bloodshed has produced no credible outcome. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, it is a stance that has let the country\u2019s cartels and criminal groups strengthen their grip on every aspect of society. The cartels played a more prominent role in Sunday\u2019s elections than ever before, assassinating several dozen candidates in the run up to the election, as well as killing politicians\u2019 family members and campaign teams. Two people were even killed at polling stations as the voting got underway.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Mexico's criminal gangs stir up political violence ahead of election season\n\n\n\n\nAll Mexicans have been exposed to higher levels of criminality and violence over recent years. But the country\u2019s women have been disproportionately affected. They have suffered from what is often termed toxic masculinity and the nation\u2019s dominant male chauvinist ideology. \nThis is an ideology that, according to some, has been legitimised and exacerbated by the L\u00f3pez Obrador administration\u2019s lack of interest in, and limited resources for, addressing gender-based violence. \nDuring his term, L\u00f3pez Obrador has made a long line of sexist comments that have angered feminist groups. In 2020, he even accused a nationwide women\u2019s movement set up to draw attention to gender-based violence as being a front established by his \u201cconservative\u201d opponents for nefarious reasons.\nEvery year, more than 3,000 women in Mexico are murdered. And around a quarter of these murders are counted as femicide, where women are murdered simply because they are women. Girls and women also form the bulk of kidnapping, disappearances and human trafficking in the country. \nThe number of women undergoing these forms of violence in Mexico is likely to be much higher due to the substantial number of unreported and uninvestigated instances.\n\nThe killing of women in Mexico persists because of impunity. Men who commit femicide know that there is very little chance of facing justice. In 2018, for example, 93% of crimes in the country were either not reported or not investigated. Institutional apathy, weak legal protections and inadequate funding has placed women and girls in Mexico at greater risk of violence.\nThere is an urgency to address this issue. The election of Sheinbaum to the top political post puts a spotlight on the state of women in the country. \nOn the campaign trail, Sheinbaum repeatedly said: \u201cI see myself as a feminist.\u201d And she has reiterated that: \u201cWhat I don\u2019t agree with is violence. We [as a nation] cannot accept violence of any kind.\u201d\nAs a woman, a self-declared feminist, and a committed technocrat keen to improve the condition of women in society, Sheinbaum has the role cut out for her on matters of gender justice in the country.\nThe elephant in the room\nAccording to her critics, Sheinbaum is a continuity candidate walking in L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s shadow, who still enjoys one of the highest approval ratings in Latin America. Her critics have pointed out that she kept vague her security policies and proposals throughout the election campaign. \nHowever, while she may not have confronted the issue head on, it would be unfair to suggest she has not thought the issue through. Her past record on confronting security challenges presents a different picture.\nMexico City\u2019s homicide rate fell 50% between December 2018, when Sheinbaum was inaugurated as mayor, and June 2023, when she stepped aside to begin her presidential campaign. She attributes this drop in violence to effective security policies that improved police work and coordination with prosecutors.\nMexicans have voted Sheinbaum in not because she is a woman, but with the hope that she can turn things around. Despite assuring voters of \u201cmore of the same\u201d throughout her campaign, Sheinbaum has vowed to reduce the murder rate from 23.3 homicides for every 100,000 residents to about 19.4 per 100,000 by 2027. \nSheinbaum has a very steep uphill climb. But she must succeed where her predecessor failed.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Violence, Mexico, War on Drugs, Criminality, Gender-based violence, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Disappearance, Mexican cartels, Give me perspective, Mexico election 2024, Claudia Sheinbaum","role":"assistant"}]}

That marks a 13% rise from the 222,018 migrants arrested by the Border Patrol along the U.S.-Mexico border in December 2022. \nJean Lantz Reisz, an immigration law scholar at the University of Southern California, explains four key things to know about how this executive order will take effect and influence immigration trends.\n\n1. The executive order is basically an asylum ban\nBiden announced his executive order on June 4, 2024. It prevents everyone who crosses the U.S.-Mexico border without a visa, and not passing through an official port of entry, from seeking asylum. It goes into effect when the number of people crossing the U.S.-Mexico border each day exceeds an average of 2,500.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere have generally been more than 2,500 people without visas crossing the U.S.-Mexico border for each day of Biden\u2019s entire presidency. \nEffectively, this is a ban on asylum, meaning the legal right for undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. because of the harm they face in their home countries. \nUnder Biden\u2019s order, some undocumented migrants who express a fear of returning to their home countries may be eligible for other kinds of legal protections \u2013 for example, legal protections intended for torture survivors.\nIn order to get this special legal protection, migrants would have to show U.S. border and immigration officials a lot of evidence outlining the danger they would face in their home countries. They would need to show more evidence than is required for asylum-seekers. Migrants will generally not have this evidence on hand and, as a result, will not receive any kind of legal protection or chance to stay in the U.S.  \nOver the past decade, including during Biden\u2019s presidency, approximately two-thirds of people who applied for asylum while they were in deportation proceedings were granted asylum or another kind of legal protection that allowed them to stay in the U.S., according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data organization at Syracuse University.\nBiden\u2019s order means that many individuals who previously would have been entitled to asylum, per U.S. law, will now be expelled to Mexico or their home countries without the opportunity to apply for asylum. \n2. This could lead to a rise in undocumented minors crossing the border solo\nMany individuals who reach the U.S.-Mexico border and cross into the U.S. without a visa or an online appointment to meet with U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be quickly turned back and deported to Mexico or returned to their home countries. The U.S. will need cooperation from Mexico to be able to turn back non-Mexican citizens to Mexico. Mexico currently accepts Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan and Venezuelan citizens deported from the U.S.\nIn December 2023, about one-fourth of the migrants apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border were from Mexico, while another one-fourth were from El Salvador, Guatemala or Honduras. The largest group of apprehended migrants were from other countries, including Venezuela and China.\nBiden\u2019s order will not apply to people who are under 18 and cross the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian. These children will be detained and placed in deportation proceedings where they can seek asylum or other immigration protections.  \nThis creates the risk that desperate parents will send their children alone across the border. This happened from March 2020 through May 2023, when COVID-19-related border restrictions, called Title 42, similarly banned undocumented immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border from seeking asylum. This restriction did not apply to unaccompanied minors. It resulted in a sharp spike in undocumented minors crossing the U.S. southern border from 2020 through 2023. \n3. Biden is taking a page out of Donald Trump\u2019s book\nBiden is basing this executive order, in part, on an immigration statute called 212(f), which gives the president very broad authority to suspend the entry of certain noncitizens because it would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to U.S. interests. \nFormer President Donald Trump cited this law when he implemented a travel ban that temporarily suspended the entry of noncitizens from seven countries, including five Muslim-majority countries, in 2017. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the third version of this ban as being lawful in 2018. Biden reversed the ban in 2021. \n\n4. The executive order won\u2019t be so easy to implement\nBiden\u2019s ability to actually reduce the number of migrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border without a visa or any other kind of authorization will depend on several factors. \nThe president will need Mexico to accept more deported citizens of different countries in order for the U.S. to swiftly turn away migrants. U.S. Border Patrol and immigration agencies have also been overwhelmed by the large influx of undocumented migrants crossing the border. They cannot easily apprehend and screen all migrants or quickly respond to migrants\u2019 applications to stay in the U.S. in immigration courts, which have a historic and massive backlog.\nQuickly processing and deporting migrants back to their home countries will also be an obstacle that could limit the order\u2019s effectiveness. U.S. immigration officials will first need to determine whether someone who states a fear of returning to their country qualifies for other kinds of legal protection that are not asylum.\nDeporting a Mexican citizen or a Cuban, Venezuelan, Nicaraguan or Haitian citizen can be done quickly and easily, since Mexico will accept them. Deporting migrants from other countries would require their governments to help them get the necessary travel documents and, in most cases, arrange airplane flights. \nStill, Biden\u2019s order may deter many migrants who plan to cross the border in the hopes of being allowed to remain in the U.S. and seek asylum.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Immigration, Asylum, Asylum seekers, Joe Biden, Immigration policy, Border control, Deportation, Undocumented migrants, US-Mexico border, US-Mexico border wall, Immigration reform, Border wall, Undocumented immigrants, Biden administration, Asylum Law","role":"assistant"}]}

In the interests of equality, native title holders\u2019 rights should receive the same protection as those of freehold land owners. Although native title determinations tend to make the news, the Native Title Act also regulates third party activity on native title land. Any future activities that would affect native title are referred to as \u201cfuture acts\u201d. Future acts may include, for example, grants of land, mining, agriculture, construction, and so on. \nThe inquiry will focus on the future acts provisions, and Australia\u2019s obligations under the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). \nSo why is it needed?\n\n\n\n\n\nFuture acts on native title land\nFuture act processes happen routinely. They are a part of doing business in areas subject to native title or a native title determination. The Native Title Act gives procedural rights to traditional owners depending on the type of activity proposed and the extent of native title rights affected. \nProcedural rights include: being informed of a future act, the right to be consulted and to comment on the proposal, and in some cases, a right to negotiate with the third parties involved. \nThe process establishes the terms on which the (future) act might be carried out. This may include, for example, requirements to obtain cultural heritage advice, or compensation paid to the traditional owner group. The act also allows for objections by any member of the native title group.\nIf an entity wishes to validly carry out activities that affect native title, they must enter into an indigenous land use agreement (ILUA) with the traditional owner group concerned, and register the agreement.\nAlthough the future acts regime provides a structured interface between native title holders and other intending land users, there are some well-recognised problems with the system.\n\nLimits of the future acts regime\nThe future acts regime does at least inform native title holders when their land rights are going to be interfered with (by a future act). It can also give native title holders an opportunity to negotiate the terms of use of native title land. \nHowever, native title law generally prioritises other rights. Consequently, in practice, power remains largely with non-Indigenous parties at the expense of traditional owners. \nFor example, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people do not have the right to refuse other activities on their land \u2013 even when they hold exclusive use rights. They often feel pressured to consent to future acts because if they do not, the other party will seek an arbitrated outcome that generally favours that party. In other words, the system works against traditional owners freely giving their consent.\nIn practice, ILUAs are confidential and often subject to non-disclosure provisions. These provisions prevent traditional owners from commenting publicly on matters affecting their land. The case study of Juukan Gorge illustrates the potential for disastrous outcomes where people are not able to speak up about activities on their land.\n\nFurther, over the years, commentators have observed that the courts have interpreted the future acts provisions to the detriment of traditional owners. The protection provided by the provisions has therefore been diminished, and a review is warranted.\nHuman rights considerations\nThe inquiry\u2019s terms of reference require the ALRC to take account of the 2021 report by the former Joint Standing Committee on Northern Australia, \u201cA Way Forward\u201d. The report recommends review of the Native Title Act, including the future acts regime, protection of the right to free prior and informed consent, and prohibition of non-disclosure clauses in ILUAs. These recommendations have apparently informed the framing of the current ALRC review although its scope is broader than that of the report.\nThe failure of the 2023 Voice referendum leaves Australia without an entrenched mechanism for expression of First Peoples\u2019 determination of their own affairs. However, we do have an existing native title framework and the future acts regime potentially provides First Peoples in Australia with one of the few opportunities for self-determination recognised by Australian law. This new review provides the chance to update the future acts framework to give expression to Australia\u2019s obligations under UNDRIP by including a right to self determination and the associated right to free prior and informed consent on matters affecting land. \nA commitment to the opportunity for traditional owners to engage fully in decisions affecting their land and to benefit fully from their land, would see a substantive overhaul of the existing legislation. The well-understood UNDRIP principles are a helpful place to start in re-balancing the dynamic of land negotiations.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Native title, Australia, Mark Dreyfus, Traditional owners, UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Juukan Gorge","role":"assistant"}]}

But we\u2019re also living through a mass extinction event. Never before in human history have there been such high such rates of species loss and ecosystem collapse. \nThe biodiversity crisis is not just distressing, it\u2019s a major threat to the global economy. More than half of global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) directly depends on nature. The World Economic Forum rates biodiversity loss in the top risks to the global economy over the next decade, after climate change and natural disasters.\n\nHuman-driven climate change damages nature \u2013 and loss of nature exacerbates climate change. So if humanity\u2019s efforts to mitigate climate change end up damaging nature, we shoot ourselves in the foot. \nAustralia, however, must face up to an uncomfortable truth: we are putting renewable energy projects in places that damage the species and ecosystems on which we depend.\n\nRenewables on the run\nRenewable energy projects are being developed that damage nature and culturally significant sites. Others are resented by communities, or fail at regulatory hurdles.\nEnvironmentally damaging projects put another nail in the coffin of species and ecosystems already under immense pressure. Even those that affect a relatively small area contribute to nature\u2019s \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d. \nTake, for example, the proposed Euston wind farm in southwest New South Wales. It would entail 96 turbines built near the Willandra Lakes World Heritage area, potentially affecting threatened birds.\nAnd in North Queensland, the Upper Burdekin wind farm proposal will remove 769 hectares of endangered species habitat relied on by Sharman\u2019s wallabies, koalas and northern greater gliders. The cleared area would be almost 200 times bigger than the Melbourne Cricket Ground. \nThe simple overlay below, which we prepared, illustrates the problem in Queensland. The analysis, part of a research project funded by Boundless Earth, shows in stark detail the crossover between energy projects, transmission lines and nationally listed threatened species habitats and ecosystems. \n\nThe \u2018fast-track\u2019 can also be the good track\nIn their understandable haste to get more clean energy projects built, state and federal governments are promising to \u201cstreamline\u201d approvals processes. Fast-tracked approvals will only provide net social benefit if they are based on good data, sound analysis and genuine community engagement.\nTwo successive reviews of our national environmental laws, most recently by Graeme Samuel, identified what\u2019s needed to improve the efficiency of development approvals and get better outcomes for nature. The answer? Good planning at the regional scale, underpinned by good data.\nAt a minimum, we need to know the locations of threatened or culturally significant species and places, high-value agriculture and valuable natural areas. A proposed new federal body, Environmental Information Australia, would seek to centralise existing biodiversity data. But significantly more data are required to fill important knowledge gaps.\nGood planning can create shared purpose and bring positive environmental and social outcomes, including certainty to developers and conservationists. In Queensland, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has enjoyed strong planning support based on good data and high community participation for more than 30 years, with some conservation success.\nIn contrast, poor planning polarises stakeholders and communities. It erodes trust between stakeholders, developers and government by reducing the integrity and quality of planning decisions. This leads to ongoing conflict over land use, as has been observed in Queensland.\nA proposal to build a renewable energy microgrid in Queensland\u2019s Daintree rainforest is a case in point. It is causing pain for local communities, pitting renewable energy advocates against conservation organisations.\nWhen projects fail to gain community support and necessary approvals, the proponent\u2019s money is wasted, and we lose precious time in the urgent transition to renewables.\nRenewables projects should enhance nature\nIt\u2019s surprising and disappointing how few proponents of Australian renewables projects actively seek to enhance the habitat values of the land their projects occupy. \nIn part, this is because planning regulations are still firmly focused on avoiding impacts to nature, and offsetting damage when it occurs.\nInstead, we need policies and laws that compel nature-positive approaches that regenerate biodiversity. \nIn California, for example, a test project to grow native plants under solar panels is restoring prairie land and pollinator habitat at the site of a decommissioned nuclear power station. In Australia, there are occasional signs we may move in a similar direction.\nIt\u2019s not hard to envisage a renewables rollout that prioritises projects on degraded, ex-agricultural land, avoiding damage to critical habitats and benefiting nature. Wind turbines should be built away from natural vegetation and migratory routes for birds and bats. \nOur mapping for potential wind and solar projects in southern Queensland shows strong potential west of the Great Dividing Range for energy generation without the same level of land-use conflict with natural values and productive agriculture.\n\nA major challenge to energy project development in Queensland, as in some other parts of Australia, is a lack of transmission infrastructure, or \u201cpoles and wires\u201d, in the places where renewable energy and nature could most happily coexist. This infrastructure should urgently be developed in a way that does not impact natural vegetation and species habitats.\nRapidly reaching net zero is not negotiable to avoiding the worst ravages of climate change. But doing so in a way that damages nature is self-defeating. We have the planning tools and data needed to create a nature-positive climate transition. Now we need adequate state and Commonwealth government investment, leadership and political will.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Renewable energy, Biodiversity, Solar, Endangered species, Wind energy, Getting to Zero","role":"assistant"}]}

Sectors such as cement, steel and chemical manufacturing produce significant carbon dioxide emissions difficult to eliminate through renewable energy alone. \nThis is why carbon capture, utilisation and storage has a place. This technology \u2013\u00a0invented by the oil and gas industry \u2013\u00a0is the best solution we have at present to capture these emissions at their source, before they can escape to the atmosphere. \nEnvironmentalists have long been sceptical of carbon capture, warning it could be used to prolong fossil fuel dependence. That\u2019s a matter for policy \u2013\u00a0the science is clear. We will need to capture carbon for the time being.  \nWhile essential, the roll out of carbon capture is sluggish. As a new report shows today, we\u2019re removing just two billion tonnes of CO\u2082 from the atmosphere each year \u2013\u00a0and almost all of that is by planting trees. Carbon capture accounts for less than 0.1% so far. \nHow does carbon capture and storage work?\nThe technology was first used in the 1920s to separate carbon dioxide out from methane in fossil gas deposits. \nBy the 1970s, it had found use in boosting oil recovery \u2013\u00a0if you separate out the CO\u2082, you can pump it back down into the oil field and get more out. To date, the world\u2019s largest carbon capture operation is in Western Australia, where Chevron is pumping carbon dioxide filtered from natural gas back underground%20facility%20on%20Barrow%20Island.). This history is why there\u2019s been so much scepticism about the technology.\nThis is not entirely fair. The technology itself is neutral. If we detach it from its history, we can better assess its worth. \nWhat carbon capture and storage offers is the ability to capture carbon dioxide emitted by the manufacture of cement and iron\/steel. Together these account for about 15% of the world\u2019s emissions total (8% and 7.2% respectively). \n\nOnce we capture carbon dioxide, we can use it in industrial processes such as chemical synthesis and food preservation. This approach can cut emissions while adding value, if waste CO\u2082 can be used for valuable products. \nAlternatively, it can be stored in deep underground in stable geological formations such as porous sandstone capped with impermeable rock, or salt caverns, either natural or human-made. Here, it should stay for hundreds of years as gas. In some locations, carbon dioxide can react with minerals to form stable carbonates, effectively turning CO\u2082 into rock. \nCarbon capture and storage can be added reasonably easily to existing infrastructure such as fossil fuel power plants, oil and gas fields and gas compression stations, offering a transitional pathway towards clean energy. \nRetrofitting existing plants with capture and storage technology can significantly reduce emissions without the need to immediately decommission still-functional power plants.\nWhat if carbon capture is a fig leaf?\nCritics of carbon capture argue the technology will likely be used to prolong the use of fossil fuels rather than phase them out as quickly as possible. In this view, carbon capture would be used by fossil fuel plant operators and companies as a way to make coal or gas \u201cgreen\u201d, and delay the full transition. \nThis concern is valid. There is a risk leaders in fossil-fuel intensive industries might see capture and storage as a way to continue their operations with less pressure to innovate or reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, just as some have embraced carbon offsets to avoid fundamental change.\nBut again, this doesn\u2019t mean we should discard the technology. While we now have good options for making electricity without emissions, we don\u2019t yet have many options in tackling industrial emissions. While methods of making steel and cement without fossil fuels are emerging, change is slow and the problem of climate change is urgent.   \nAuthorities from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to the International Energy Agency see an unavoidable role for carbon capture and storage. \nThe European Union\u2019s Green Deal emphasises the role of carbon capture in cutting industrial emissions, while the United States has introduced tax credits and funding to accelerate its adoption.\nAustralia\u2019s government last year invited companies to explore ten offshore sedimentary basins for possible carbon storage. But not everywhere is suitable \u2013\u00a0Queensland\u2019s government recently banned the technology anywhere inside the Great Artesian Basin, due to concerns over the impact of the gas on groundwater. \nHow can we make best use of the technology?\nFor carbon capture and storage to grow to the size we need, it will need effective policy support such as tax credits, subsidies, and funding for research and development to drive innovation and cut costs. \nIn my research, I have worked with industry partners to find ways of making carbon capture useful. If a waste product has value, there\u2019s an immediate incentive to capture it. For instance, I\u2019ve worked on converting carbon dioxide into \u201csolar fuels\u201d such as green methane and methanol. \n\nWe might think the future of energy will be solar, wind and storage. But it\u2019s not going to be that simple. Fossil fuels will be harder to wean ourselves off than we realise. We\u2019ll need green hydrogen for industrial uses and to make ammonia for green fertilisers. And we\u2019ll have to ramp up carbon capture and storage for industrial emissions. \nWe might not like the idea of carbon capture and storage, but we will need it if we are going to get serious about net zero. At present, there\u2019s nothing else like it for hard-to-abate sectors. What we must avoid is using it to prop up fossil fuels.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Fossil fuels, Climate change, Renewable energy, Energy, Carbon capture and storage, Environment, Oil and gas, CCUS, green transition, Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), Carbon removal","role":"assistant"}]}

The groundwater salinity seemed to be specifically related to the location of these heuweltjies. We used radiocarbon dating; dating the mounds, we reasoned, would allow us to see when minerals that were stored in the mounds were flushed to the groundwater.\nThe tests revealed far more than we expected: Namaqualand\u2019s heuweltjies, it turns out, are the world\u2019s oldest inhabited termite mounds. Some date as far back as between 34,000 and 13,000 years. The oldest previously known inhabited mounds were 4,000 years old (from a different termite species from Brazil) and 2,300 years old (from central Congo).\nThis is more than just an interesting scientific find or historical curiosity. It offers a window into what our planet looked like tens of thousands of years ago, providing a living archive of environmental conditions that shaped our world. \n\n\n\n\n\nIt is also hugely important today: there is growing evidence that termites have a substantial, but still poorly understood, role in the carbon cycle. By studying these and other termite mounds, scientists can gain a better understanding of how to sequester (store) carbon. This process removes CO\u2082 from the atmosphere and is vital for mitigating climate change.\nCarbon storage\nNamaqualand is a global biodiversity hotspot renowned for its spring flowers, but it is a dry area. Surface water is in short supply and the groundwater is saline. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Southern Africa's Namaqualand daisies are flowering earlier: why it's a red flag\n\n\n\n\nAlthough most of Namaqualand receives very little rainfall, there are rare, high intensity rainfall events. When these do occur, the termite burrows on the mound surfaces serve as  water flow paths that can harvest rain and channel water into the mound. This causes the salts that built up in the mounds over thousands of years to be flushed into the groundwater system via flow paths created by the tunnelling action of the termites, pushing the dissolved minerals ever deeper. This process also pushes down the carbon that slowly built up in the centre of the mounds when termites collected plant material and brought it into the mound over millennia.\n\nThe ability of these mounds to sequester carbon is linked to the termites\u2019 unique behaviour. The insects transport organic material \u2013 such as small sticks about 2cm long and a few millimetres wide from small woody plants \u2013 deep into the soil. This way, fresh stores of carbon are continuously added at depths greater than one metre. Deep storage reduces the likelihood of organic carbon being released back into the atmosphere. So the mound acts as a long-term carbon sink.\nNot only do the termites take the organic carbon material deep underground into their nests, but their tunnels also allow dissolved inorganic carbon (known as soil calcite or calcium carbonate) in the mound soil to move into the groundwater along with other soluble minerals. So the termite mounds also offer a mechanism to sequester carbon dioxide through dissolution and leaching of soil carbonate-bicarbonate to groundwater. This is a long term carbon storage method that carbon storage companies are trying to replicate to reduce atmospheric carbon.\nThe results of our radiocarbon dating of both the organic and inorganic carbon in this soil show that the mounds have been accumulating organic matter and nutrients, including carbon, for tens of thousands of years. This enrichment is one of the reasons that Namaqualand\u2019s famous wildflowers are so prominent on the mounds in spring. \nDuring the mounds\u2019 formation, the region experienced more rainfall than it does today. Studying the layers of the mounds and looking at the carbon, sulphur, and oxygen isotopes preserved in the mounds and in the groundwater showed that periods of higher rainfall in the region were associated with global climate cooling. These cooler and wetter periods were associated with the leaching of accumulated carbon and other minerals to the groundwater. \nTiny engineers\nThese findings are further evidence that termites fully deserve their reputation as ecosystem engineers. They modify their soil surroundings to maintain ideal humidity and temperature conditions, and their foraging paths extend many tens of metres.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Africa now emits as much carbon as it stores: landmark new study\n\n\n\n\nWe argue that, given what we\u2019ve uncovered in Namaqualand, termite activity should be incorporated into carbon models. These primarily focus on forests and oceans; including termite mounds can help provide a more comprehensive understanding of global carbon dynamics. In Namaqualand, mounds occupy 27% of the total area but contribute 44 % of the total soil organic carbon stock. This highlights the disproportionate contribution termite mounds make to carbon stocks in these semi-arid environments.\nPublic awareness and policy integration are key, too. Termite mounds are often cleared for agriculture or termites are considered pests. Raising awareness about the ecological importance of termite mounds and integrating these findings into environmental policies can help promote practices that support natural carbon sinks. \nThis research was conducted by a dedicated team from Stellenbosch University in South Africa (Department of Soil Science and Department of Earth Sciences), in collaboration with experts from the Institute for Nuclear Research in Hungary.\nC.E.

People use unique names to address each other, but we\u2019re one of only a handful of animal species known to do that, including bottlenose dolphins. Finding more animals with names and investigating how they use them can improve scientists\u2019 understanding of both other animals and ourselves.\nAs elephant researchers who have observed free-ranging elephants for years, my colleagues and I get to know wild elephants as individuals, and we make up names for them that help us remember who is who. The elephants in question live fully in the wild and are, of course, unaware of the epithets we apply to them.\nBut in a new study published in Nature Ecology and Evolution, we found evidence that elephants have their own names that they use to address each other. This research places elephants among the very small number of species known to address one another in this way, and it has implications for scientists\u2019 understanding of animal intelligence and the evolutionary origins of language.\nFinding evidence for name-like calls\nMy colleagues and I had long suspected that elephants might be able to address one another with name-like calls, but no researchers had tested that idea. To explore this question, we followed elephants across the Kenyan savanna, recording their vocalizations and noting, whenever possible, who made each call and whom the call was addressed to.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen most people think of elephant calls, they imagine loud trumpets. But really, most elephant calls are deep, thrumming sounds known as rumbles that are partially below the range of human hearing. We thought that if elephants have names, they most likely say them in rumbles, so we focused on these calls in our analysis.\n\n\n\n\n        Elephant rumbles have a deep, sonorous sound.\n        Michael Pardo236 KB (download)\n\nWe reasoned that if rumbles contain something like a name, then we should be able to identify whom a call is intended for based purely on the call\u2019s properties. To determine whether this was the case, we trained a machine learning model to identify the recipient of each call. \nWe fed the model a series of numbers describing the sound properties of each call and told it which elephant each call was addressed to. Based on this information, the model tried to learn patterns in the calls associated with the identity of the recipient. Then, we asked the model to predict the recipient for a separate sample of calls. We used a total of 437 calls from 99 individual callers to train the model.\nPart of the reason we needed to use machine learning for this analysis is because rumbles convey multiple messages at once, including the identity, age and sex of the caller, emotional state and behavioral context. Names are likely only one small component within these calls. A computer algorithm is often better than the human ear at detecting such complex and subtle patterns.\nWe didn\u2019t expect elephants to use names in every call, but we had no way of knowing ahead of time which calls might contain a name. So, we included all the rumbles where we thought they might use names at least some of the time in this analysis. \nThe model successfully identified the recipient for 27.5% of these calls \u2013 significantly better than what it would have achieved by randomly guessing. This result indicated that some rumbles contained information that allowed the model to identify the intended recipient of the call.\nBut this result alone wasn\u2019t enough evidence to conclude that the rumbles contained names. For example, the model might have picked up on the unique voice patterns of the caller and guessed who the recipient was based on whom the caller tended to address the most. \nIn our next analysis, we found that calls from the same caller to the same recipient were significantly more similar, on average, than calls from the same caller to different recipients. This meant that the calls really were specific to individual recipients, like a name.\nNext, we wanted to determine whether elephants could perceive and respond to their names. To figure that out, we played 17 elephants a recording of a call that was originally addressed to them that we assumed contained their name. Then, on a separate day, we played them a recording of the same caller addressing someone else. \n\nThe elephants vocalized and approached the source of the sound more readily when the call was one originally addressed to them. On average, they approached the speaker 128 seconds sooner, vocalized 87 seconds sooner and produced 2.3 times more vocalizations in response to a call that was intended for them. That result told us that elephants can determine whether a call was meant for them just by hearing the call out of context.\nNames without imitation\nElephants are not the only animals with name-like calls. Bottlenose dolphins and some parrots address other individuals by imitating the signature call of the addressee, which is a unique \u201ccall sign\u201d that dolphins and parrots usually use to announce their own identity.\nThis system of naming via imitation is a little different from the way names and other words typically work in human language. While we do occasionally name things by imitating the sounds that they make, such as \u201ccuckoo\u201d and \u201czipper,\u201d most of our words are arbitrary. They have no inherent acoustic connection to the thing they refer to. \nArbitrary words are part of what allows us to talk about such a wide range of topics, including objects and ideas that don\u2019t make any sound.\nIntriguingly, we found that elephant calls addressed to a particular recipient were no more similar to the recipient\u2019s calls than to the calls of other individuals. This finding suggested that like humans, but unlike other animals, elephants may address one another without just imitating the addressee\u2019s calls. \n\nWhat\u2019s next\nWe\u2019re still not sure exactly where the elephant names are located within a call or how to tease them apart from all of the other information conveyed in a rumble. \nNext, we want to figure out how to isolate the names for specific individuals. Achieving that will allow us to address a range of other questions, such as whether different callers use the same name to address the same recipient, how elephants acquire their names, and even whether they ever talk about others in their absence. \nName-like calls in elephants could potentially tell researchers something about how human language evolved. \nMost mammals, including our closest primate relatives, produce only a fixed set of vocalizations that are essentially preprogrammed into their brain at birth. But language depends on being able to learn new words. \nSo, before our ancestors could develop a full-fledged language, they needed to evolve the ability to learn new vocalizations. Dolphins, parrots and elephants have all independently evolved this capacity, and they all use it to address one another by name. \nMaybe our ancestors originally evolved the ability to learn new vocalizations in order to learn names for each other, and then later co-opted this ability to learn a wider range of words.\nOur findings also underscore how incredibly complex elephants are. Using arbitrary sounds to name other individuals implies a capacity for abstract thought, as it involves using sound as a symbol to represent another elephant. \nThe fact that elephants need to name each other in the first place highlights the importance of their many, distinct social bonds.\nLearning about the elephant mind and its similarities to ours may also increase humans\u2019 appreciation for elephants at a time when conflict with humans is one of the biggest threats to wild elephant survival.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Evolution, Language, Wildlife, Ecology, Africa, Linguistics, Elephant, Elephants, Animals, Animal intelligence, Names, Animal behavior, New research, Animal language, STEEHM new research","role":"assistant"}]}

In 2023, it joined almost 20 states that require or allow officials in public schools to post the national motto, \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d\nNow, the Bayou State has become the first in the nation to require the posting of the Ten Commandments in classrooms in public schools, colleges and universities.\nGov. Jeff Landry signed House Bill 71 into law on June 19, 2024, requiring officials in public schools, including colleges and universities, to post a specific version of the Ten Commandments. The text is similar to the King James translation of the Bible used in many Protestant churches.\nOfficials must post a context statement highlighting the role of the Ten Commandments in American history and may also display the Pilgrims\u2019 Mayflower Compact, the Declaration of Independence and the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, a federal enactment to settle the frontier \u2013 and the earliest congressional document encouraging the creation of schools.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the bill\u2019s supporters, state Sen. J. Adam Bass, defended it on the grounds that its \u201cpurpose is not solely religious.\u201d He told fellow lawmakers that the Ten Commandments are important because of their \u201chistorical significance, which is simply one of many documents that display the history of our country and foundation of our legal system.\u201d\nAs someone who teaches and researches law around religion and education, I believe the law is problematic. It is likely to invite litigation at a time when the Supreme Court\u2019s thinking on religion and state is shifting.\nHow SCOTUS has ruled before\nLitigation over the Ten Commandments is not new. More than 40 years ago, in Stone v. Graham, the Supreme Court rejected a Kentucky statute that mandated displays of the Ten Commandments in classrooms.\nThe court reasoned that the underlying law violated the First Amendment\u2019s establishment clause \u2013 \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\u201d \u2013 because the mandate lacked a secular purpose.\nThe justices were not persuaded by a small notation on posters that described the Ten Commandments as the \u201cfundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\u201d\nTwenty-five years later, the Supreme Court again took up cases challenging public displays of the Ten Commandments, although not in schools. This time, the justices reached mixed results.\nThe first arose in Kentucky, where officials had erected a county courthouse display about texts including the Ten Commandments, the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence and a biblical citation. In a 2005 ruling in McCreary County, Kentucky v. American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky, the five-person majority agreed that display of the Ten Commandments violated the establishment clause, largely because it lacked a secular legislative purpose.\nOn the same day, however, the Supreme Court reached the opposite result in Van Orden v. Perry, a case from Texas. The court upheld the constitutionality of a display of the Ten Commandments on the grounds of the state capitol as one of 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating Texas\u2019 history.\nUnlike the fairly new display in Kentucky, the one in Texas, which had existed since the early 1960s, was erected using private funds. The court permitted the Ten Commandments to remain because, despite their religious significance, the monument was a more passive display than in Stone: spread out across 22 acres, rather than posted on the courthouse door.\n\nLouisiana\u2019s law\nLouisiana\u2019s law requires public school officials to display framed copies of the Ten Commandments in all public school classrooms. Posters must be at least 11-by-14 inches and be printed with a large, easily readable font. The legislation allows, but does not require, officials to use state funds to purchase these posters. Displays can also be received as donations or purchased with gifted funds. \nThe bill\u2019s author, state Rep. Dodie Horton, previously sponsored Louisiana\u2019s law mandating that \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d be posted in public school classrooms.\nIn defending the Ten Commandments proposal, she said it honors the country\u2019s religious origins.\n\u201cThe Ten Commandments are the basis of all laws in Louisiana,\u201d she told fellow lawmakers, \u201cand given all the junk our children are exposed to in classrooms today, it\u2019s imperative that we put the Ten Commandments back in a prominent position.\u201d\nJustifying the bill, Horton pointed to Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, a 2022 Supreme Court decision. Here, the justices held that educational officials could not prevent a football coach from praying on the field at the end of games, because he engaged in personal religious observance protected by the First Amendment.\n\u201cThe landscape has changed,\u201d she said.\nNew frontier\nIndeed it has. \nFor decades, the Supreme Court used a set of criteria often called the Lemon v. Kurtzman test to assess whether a government action violated the establishment clause. Under this test, when a government action or policy intersects with religion, it had to meet three criteria. A policy had to have a secular legislative purpose; its principal or primary effect could not advance religion; and it could not result in excessive entanglement between state and religious officials.\nAnother test the Supreme Court sometimes applied, stemming from Lynch v. Donnelly in 1984, invalidated governmental actions appearing to endorse religion.\nThe majority of the current court, though, abandoned both the Lemon and endorsement tests. In the majority opinion in Kennedy v. Bremerton, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote that \u201cthe Establishment Clause must be interpreted by \u2018reference to historical practices and understandings.\u2019\u201d He added that the court \u201clong ago abandoned Lemon and its endorsement test offshoot.\u201d\nWhat that new standard means remains to be seen. \nIn my view, the Louisiana law\u2019s supporters\u2019 reliance on Kennedy is mistaken. That decision upheld voluntary, private prayer, not mandated postings of religious statements, overlooking many students\u2019 beliefs.\nMore than 80 years ago, in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette the Supreme Court decided in a 6-3 opinion that students cannot be compelled to participate in saluting the American flag, including the words \u201cunder God\u201d in the Pledge of Allegiance, if doing so goes against their religious beliefs.\nUnder Louisiana\u2019s new law, students need not recite the Ten Commandments. Yet, given their distinctly religious message, I believe House Bill 71 faces a dubious future.\nThis article was updated on June 19, 2024 after Louisiana\u2019s governor signed House Bill 71 into law.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Higher education, Public education, US Supreme Court, First Amendment, US Constitution, Louisiana, Separation of church and state, Ten Commandments, Religion and society, Religion and education","role":"assistant"}]}

And can these differences create social barriers? Social scientists are struggling with these questions because the mental processes underlying social interactions are not well understood.\nOne recent concept that has become increasingly popular is the \u201cdouble-empathy problem\u201d. This draws on research looking at people who are known to experience social difficulties, such as autistic people. \nThe theory proposes that people who have very different identities and communication styles from each other \u2013 which is often the case for autistic and non-autistic people \u2013 can find it harder to empathise with one another. This two-way difficulty is what they mean by the double-empathy problem.\nThis idea is getting a lot of attention. Research on the double-empathy problem has rapidly grown over the past decade. This is because it has the potential to explain why different people in society might struggle to empathise with one another, potentially leading to personal and societal problems; from poor mental health to inter-group tensions and systemic racism. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut is this idea accurate? Our recent paper suggests that things might be much more complicated than that.\n\nOur analysis suggests that the double-empathy theory has many shortcomings. It highlights that there is widespread confusion surrounding the very fuzzy concept of double empathy. The research has also narrowly focused on social difficulties in autism without considering other social identity factors that affect empathy between different groups, such as gender.\nThe theory also fails to incorporate the psychological neuroscience of empathy. Instead, it confuses the concept of empathy \u2013 that is, psychologically feeling the emotions that other people are feeling \u2013 with similar but different phenomena, such as \u201cmentalising\u201d (understanding what people are thinking from a different perspective).\n\nBecause the double-empathy theory is not well developed, most experiments testing it are muddled. Many researchers claim to be studying double empathy when they do not measure empathy. Meanwhile, other studies are being used as evidence of double empathy despite never having set out to test this theory.\nDouble-empathy research has also heavily relied on subjective reports of people\u2019s experiences (rather than evaluation by experts), which may not tell the whole story.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The science of 'mind-reading': our new test reveals how well we understand others\n\n\n\n\nAltogether, the analysis of existing research indicates that the central claim of the double-empathy theory is not well supported. That is, being similar in identity to other people does not necessarily mean that you have more empathy for them.\nThis is an important issue that needs urgent attention. There are already signs that the double-empathy theory is being put into practice, despite lacking evidence. Certain researchers and doctors have started claiming that, because there is a double-empathy problem, healthcare professionals are generally unable to understand their patients with social difficulties. But there is no reliable evidence for this.\nLooking ahead, there is a need for more neuroscientific research on social interaction. We expect that brain imaging technologies, such as \u201chyperscanning\u201d \u2013 scanning multiple human brains at the same time \u2013 will help shed light on how different people\u2019s brains interact with each other. For example, this technique can be used to test how similarity between people who interact may influence their brain activity.\nTo make breakthroughs in this area, this technique could be used alongside artificial intelligence. Exploring whether machines can truly empathise with humans by seeing if they accurately interpret our brain waves will be of great interest.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Increasingly sophisticated AI systems can perform empathy, but their use in mental health care raises ethical questions\n\n\n\n\nThe benefits of diversity\nIt is thought that people living in more socially diverse places, such as large cities, tend to be more tolerant of those who are different from them than people who live in socially homogeneous places. They ultimately perceive themselves and others as belonging to the same local community despite ethnic and cultural differences and appear to be better at considering the perspective of others. \nThis suggests that spending time with people who are different to us can perhaps boost our empathy \u2013 something that the double-empathy theory does not predict. Ultimately, empathy is not just down to our ability to understand someone through their similarity.  Spending time with those from other social and cultural backgrounds may make us place less emphasis on differences \u2013 and discover common ground in other areas.\nHuman experience is vast and complex. Just because two people come from different cultures or have different communication styles does not mean they cannot be very similar in other ways. Perhaps their values align or they have similar interests. This insight could have the potential to remove some barriers that may otherwise make it difficult to understand and empathise with others. \nAnd, sometimes, people from similar backgrounds struggle to understand each other, yet can have great empathy for people who are completely different from them (for example, refugees fleeing war-torn countries). Why? The double-empathy theory may not be the best way to make progress, but it might serve as a springboard for future research to answer this and other questions. \nWe could really harness the social science of empathy to understand these incredibly complex social issues. This might ultimately reduce societal conflict and improve social cohesion \u2013 but we must get research on the right track to achieve this potential.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Autism, Diversity, Empathy, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Why are nipples considered an erogenous zone? Why, other than a seven-figure salary, did George Clooney agree to wear a Batsuit with nipples for the 1997 film Batman and Robin? All pressing issues, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll agree. \n\nUnlike those adorning Clooney\u2019s Batsuit, nipples have important functions for breastfeeding mothers. They contain multiple nerve endings that are sensitive to the stimulation of a suckling baby, which generates the release of the hormone oxytocin, prompting \u201clet-down\u201d of milk from the breast tissue. The nipple contains ducts through which milk is then released for feeding. \nThe coloured area around the nipple \u2013 the areola \u2013 serves a purpose too. It contains multiple glands which secrete protective substances onto the skin, most likely to protect the area from damage and chafing during breastfeeding. \n\n\n\n\n\nSuckling might not be the sole underlying trigger for milk release, however. Sometimes, even the sound of a baby crying stimulates the pituitary gland to release oxytocin in anticipation of a need to feed.\nThe pituitary also plays an important role in the growth of breast tissue during pregnancy and production of milk, which is controlled by the hormone prolactin. \nBut you can have too much prolactin. Milky discharge from the nipple in non-breastfeeding patients could be caused by a prolactinoma \u2013 a benign tumour of the pituitary gland \u2013 which can lead to increased, abnormal prolactin secretion. \nProlactinoma can affect all genders, and can generate other unusual symptoms. Because the pituitary gland is located near the crossing point of the optic nerves, a tumour could compress them as it grows and cause loss of vision. \nBreast diseases\nDisorders of the breast may present as changes in the nipple. The skin may become itchy, scaled or red \u2013 similar in appearance to eczema. The structure of the nipple may also change, becoming inverted or turned inwards, and the skin puckered or dimpled. There may also be a new discharge from the nipple, either clear, or discoloured yellow, green or red by infection, or blood. \n\nAny of these findings, and other significant symptoms like breast lumps, bumps or irregularities, should always be reported to a doctor as soon as they\u2019re noticed. Spotting these changes requires vigilance. Regular examination of the breast tissue is essential and make sure you always attend mammogram screenings too.\nAlthough men are often neglected in discussions around breast health, it is crucial for everyone to be aware of any changes in the breast region, regardless of sex. Men also possess breast tissue, albeit in smaller amounts, and can develop gynaecomastia \u2013 sometimes referred to informally as \u201cman-boobs\u201d. So, while female patients account for 99% of cases of diagnosed breast cancers, men shouldn\u2019t consider themselves exempt. \nBreast cancer isn\u2019t the only cause of nipple discharge, however - discharge can occur during pregnancy and when taking the oral contraceptive pill. Mastitis \u2013 infection of the breast tissue \u2013 can also cause discharge. Mastitis usually affects nursing mothers but can also develop in non-breastfeeding mothers and, again, in men. \nExtra nipples\nMany television shows, including The Simpsons and Friends, feature characters with third nipples. An extra nipple isn\u2019t just stuff of comedy shows, though \u2013 some celebrities including Mark Wahlberg and Lily Allen are reported to have a third nipple. Apparently, Harry Styles has four.\n\nThese celebs are part of the estimated 1-6% of the population with an extra nipple, and this is variable across the globe - up to 6% in the USA, but just 0.22% in Hungary. In some cases, it may appear as a pigmented skin spot, very much like a mole, and may go unnoticed and undiagnosed for years. The extra nipple can have breast tissue attached to it, and may respond to circulating hormones to become sore, sensitive or enlarged. \nWhy do some people have an extra nipple? It could be an echo of the \u201cmilk lines\u201d some mammals develop to feed several offspring at the same time. Dogs, cats and pigs for instance, have two parallel lines of multiple teats running from armpit to groin in order to feed large litters. However, in humans, all but two of these nipples usually regress during development of the embryo, though some can remain, leaving an extra nipple. While most occur on these milk lines, some may develop outside of them \u2013 on the face, foot or even the genitals.\nPlacement is important, though. A displaced nipple on the chest, for example, could suggest a different, rare, condition: Poland syndrome. \n\nPoland syndrome is characterised by missing or developed chest muscles, usually the pectoralis major (or pec) on one side of the body. The arms and hands can also be affected. \nAbnormalities of the nipple, then, can indicate potentially serious conditions of the breast. But they can also signal neurological and developmental disorders too. It\u2019s important therefore to pay close attention to any nipple or breast changes, and consult a doctor as soon as possible.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Pregnancy, Breastfeeding, Breast cancer, Health, Breast milk, George Clooney, male breast cancer, pituitary gland","role":"assistant"}]}

You\u2019re not the only one\n\n\nInvesting 101\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of investment apps like Robinhood or Wealthsimple, or ones like Coinbase that allow you to invest in crypto currencies.\nInvesting is pretty much what you make of it. It can be like Minecraft, slowly placing blocks to develop a long-term diversified set of assets through investment funds, like exchange traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. \nMost investment funds hold portfolios of stocks, bonds and other investments. ETFs trade on exchanges just like stocks, and most passively track an index, with little or no active management by fund managers. Mutual funds are more actively managed and they generally have higher fees than ETFs. \nIf you\u2019re more of a risk-taker, investing can also be fast-paced like COD: shooting with options, penny stocks, crypto and other speculative tools. \nSimilar to gaming, you are only one participant in a much bigger world. There are days when you will lose and days when you win. Strategies that work in some situations but not in other situations. Expert players and novices.\nIf you\u2019re completely new to things, try out an investing simulation. Some trading platforms allow you to use a version of their app or website where you can make simulated investments. Some of them are free or cost around $10-$15, like TradingView and eToro. MarketWatch even lets you create an investing game that you can invite your friends to participate in. \nNext, you\u2019ll need an investment account. Most big banks offer self-managed investment accounts. If you want to save a bit, check out discount brokers that charge lower or no commission (but read the fine print and know what other fees they might charge you).\nBe sure to check out any tax-free investing accounts available in your country, like the TFSA in Canada or Roth IRA in the United States. These are a valuable way to grow your net worth without paying additional tax.\nWhat kind of investing should I get into?\nTake a lesson from Bob, the world\u2019s worst market timer. He starts investing at 22, and every time he does, the market crashes. You\u2019d guess he loses all his money, right? Not really, over his working life Bob invests $184,000, but ends up with a total of $1.1 million at retirement. \nHow? Bob put his money into an S&P 500 index fund and kept it to retirement, through good or bad. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      What\u2019s an index fund?\n\n\n\n\nThe moral of the story is that you don\u2019t have to be lucky or very savvy. Most important is to have a diverse portfolio and stay in the market. Don\u2019t sell or buy in a panic, keep contributing. Buy diversified funds, rather than individual stocks, at least in the beginning. Then, as you learn, you can pick stocks and even invest part of your portfolio in riskier assets.\nYou still have decades to slowly get your millions. \n\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      What do I need to know before investing in ETFs and what are the risks?\n\n\n\n\nSome strategies that have proven their worth\nThe value investing strategy, made famous by financial analyst Benjamin Graham and championed by the likes of American investor Warren Buffett, is summarized by with the motto: \u201cThis too will pass.\u201d \nBasically, pick a good company, in a moment when it\u2019s undervalued for some reason: bad news, lost contract, temporary mismanagement etc. Buffett has likened good companies to castles with a deep moat around them \u2013 that is they have a competitive edge durable in time, an unique product, customer loyalty or pricing power. Think Apple, American Express or Coca Cola. \nThe growth investing strategy, championed by fund manager Cathie Wood, tries to identify companies whose earnings will grow very fast (but could crash equally fast). Companies like Tesla, Coinbase, UiPath, Roku etc. AI has given a huge boost to this strategy recently, but in long term, it\u2019s hard to tell if it\u2019s better than the value strategy.\nA different approach, favoured by investors that prefer a more stable stream of income, is the dividend strategy. Dividends are the money distributed to shareholders from company\u2019s profits. \nHistorically, dividend stocks have outperformed the S&P 500, and with less volatility. Think about it: you get a return on investment from stock price growth as well as dividends that you can reinvest.\nIn sum, pick a strategy that fits you and get to work. You can pick stocks, or you can pick diversified funds. As investor Peter Lynch insisted, \u201cknow what you own, and know why you own it.\u201d Invest in stocks or funds whose business model you understand. Love cars? Study different manufacturers, see what different companies are working on, what customers like this year, and figure out who\u2019s making money before quarterly statements are pointing out the winners and losers.\nWhat should I be careful about?\nMany new investors buy on the hype. Imagine there\u2019s some good news coming up about Tesla. You wake up, and while having your coffee, you see the news and buy the stock. \nBut think. Investors following TSLA already know what the article is about. By the time you\u2019ve read the news, people with deep pockets on Wall Street are already placing their bets. By the time you buy the stock, the market will have already integrated that news and now the price will probably go down. \nSame with the long-term hype: when your cab driver is giving stock or crypto advice it\u2019s time to get out of the market.\n\nAnother pitfall is the quick money, speculation, dopamine addiction. Subreddits like r\/wallstreetbets provide many great examples of this. If you turn your life into a casino, you will win some times, but in the end the house always wins. A bet here and there can be fun though.\nAs a young person, you have an advantage: time. As you get older you will understand the long-term trends and market drivers \u2014 economy, geo-politics, innovation and so forth. As you progress in your career, you will understand more about your industry and this too may turn into profits. Over the years, eight per cent per year, with compounding, goes very far.\nFinally, as ethical people, we need to walk the talk. We can\u2019t pretend to want to save the Earth if our money is going to heavy polluters. Beware of pretenders \u2014 many are just deceptively mimicking behaviours to get high environmental, social and governance scores.\nResearch well your investment and its entire supply chain. Think about what goes into making the product, the people behind it and what impact it has on our world. Are you morally comfortable giving your money to certain companies?\nPut in the time and don\u2019t rush in, some investments are for life.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Money, Shares, Investing, Stocks, mutual funds, S&P 500, TFSAs, responsible investing, ETF, Return on investment, Quarter Life","role":"assistant"}]}

By definition, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) are people diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15 and 39. In Canada, there are more cancer diagnoses in this age group than ever before: nearly 8,300 diagnoses each year, or one AYA diagnosed every 65 minutes. \nHowever, there is limited understanding and support for the distinct medical and psychosocial complexities adolescents and young adults face, and cancer care systems rarely support the unique needs of patients in these age groups. \nWhat is known is that cancer is different for adolescents and young adults than it is for children or older adults. However, only 0.4 per cent of all cancer research funding focuses on young adult cancer. Cancer diagnoses in young people often occur at a later stage with poorer outcomes and lower survival rates compared to older age groups Further, a recent report in the journal of Nature questions if early onset cancer is a global epidemic.\nDistinct challenges for younger patients\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a strange experience facing mortality at an age where the world assumes we\u2019re vivacious. Having cancer as a young person changes you in profound ways.\u201d ~young adult navigating cancer\n\nNot only are patients in this age group navigating the challenges of facing a life-altering cancer diagnosis, they are also often navigating other challenges distinct to their life stage. They may be mid-way through post-secondary education, building a career, establishing a relationship and\/or a family, and becoming independent \u2014 all of which can be impacted significantly by cancer. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdolescents and young adults struggle with distinct fears, too, ranging from early death, to infertility, to financial instability and cancer recurrence \u2014 each of which must be managed for however long life continues. For AYAs with diverse intersectionalities (for example, race, gender, sex, class, age, disability, geography, health status), the challenges are further amplified and there is limited focus on understanding their distinct needs. There is an urgent need for AYA-specific care and support.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I was just so floored that I had this sickness and that I had to stop nursing school. I had to stop everything that I had planned for myself.\u201d ~young adult navigating cancer\n\nThe provision of AYA-specific care is standard in the United Kingdom and Australia, and the United States\u2019 National Cancer Institute and the American Society of Clinical Oncology Care recommend specialized training and oncologic and supportive care programs focused on adolescents and young adults. \nIn Canada, although young people represent four per cent of patients diagnosed each year, there are few oncologic and supportive programs specific to this age group. Princess Margaret Cancer Centre has a dedicated AYA Oncology Program; CancerCare Manitoba has an AYA support program as part of its patient and family support services; and Alberta Health Services provides AYA navigators as part of its development of an AYA support program. In British Columbia, despite a concentrated, representative effort from 2016-18, there is currently no provincial AYA-specific program.\nInspiring change in B.C.\nYet, momentum and partnerships are growing to reshape young adult cancer care in B.C. The Anew Research Collaborative, based at Royal Roads University in Victoria, is led by Cheryl Heykoop, Michael Smith Health Research B.C. Scholar and one of the authors of this story, who herself experienced cancer as an AYA. Anew is working with adolescents and young adults, BC Cancer, BC Children\u2019s Hospital, related care providers and partners to create change for AYAs.\nAnew works with young people navigating cancer, those who offer treatment and support, and those who make health system decisions to co-generate knowledge, relationships and strategies to improve cancer care for young adults, with a specific emphasis on those with diverse intersectionalities. \nOur approach draws on the principles of participatory action research, patient-oriented research and creative action research using a range of creative methods to support engagement, build capacity, share knowledge and facilitate tangible improvements in young adult cancer care. This approach acknowledges that adolescents and young adults are experts of their own cancer experiences who, in engaging creatively with cancer care providers, inspire meaningful change.\nThe impact of such collaboration was evidenced at the BC Cancer Summit (BC Cancer\u2019s annual conference) in both 2022 and 2023. Anew co-facilitated sessions with BC Cancer both years, bringing adolescents and young adults together with cancer care professionals to begin improving care. The first year focused on identifying and prioritizing the key issues to address \u2014 a road map to guide efforts going forward, and the second year saw patients in this age group and care providers collaborate to explore the top three issues in depth:\n\ntimely access to fertility services and effective information;\nprovision of counselling services customized to meet the needs of adolescent and young adults experiencing cancer; and\ndevelopment of resources and supports to continue with life thereafter.\n\nParticipants also co-designed tangible solutions to address each of these key issues. \nDedicated care for young patients\n\nSince then, there\u2019s been a flurry of initiatives based on these priorities, including AYAs working together with Anew and care providers to establish:\n\na dedicated section of the BC Cancer website providing links to AYA resources both within BC Cancer and externally;\na pilot counselling program for AYAs newly diagnosed with breast cancer;\nimproved fertility care for AYAs, including co-design of effective resources to enable timely decision-making, enhancement of BC Cancer\u2019s pregnancy policy to include fertility care; and educational opportunities for clinicians and care providers to increase understanding of fertility preservation and the barriers to be addressed.\n\nThis collaborative effort to streamline fertility care is impressive with BC Cancer, BC Children\u2019s Hospital, Vancouver General Hospital and Yukon hospitals working together with B.C.\/Yukon AYAs, Anew and related care providers.\nFurther, Anew and BC Cancer will partner again at this year\u2019s Summit (Nov. 21-23) co-facilitating a session on improving fertility care for young adults and debuting an AYA Immersive Experience, designed by AYAs to provide a multi-sensory, living library-like perspective of what it\u2019s like to navigate cancer as an AYA and explore opportunities to improve cancer care and support. Together, we continue to take steps forward and create change. Amidst the devastating realities of being diagnosed with cancer as an adolescent or young adult in B.C., there are promising times ahead.\nPatients, families, health-care providers and researchers can learn more and register for updates at Anew\u2019s website.\nThis story was co-authored by Jennifer Wolfe, Research Program Co-ordinator, Anew Research Collaborative\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Cancer, Youth, Adolescents, Cancer care, Health-care system, Young adult, access to care","role":"assistant"}]}

The plan, announced ahead of the 2024 budget, includes funding 1,200 places for aspiring teachers to be trained in the classroom, rather than in universities as they currently are.\nWhile there will still be funding for university places, the policy appears to prioritise school-based training. Trainee teachers will be based primarily in schools, with coursework on top of their daily teaching responsibilities. \nIt is a significant shift away from the dominant training model whereby student teachers undertake tertiary level courses alongside periods of teaching experience in schools. \nBy training teachers on site, the government hopes to improve classroom preparedness. It follows similar moves in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd to be fair, while a lot of the policy detail is unknown, additional funding of teacher education will almost certainly increase the number of places where prospective teachers can train. \nHowever, moving away from university-based teacher education has the potential to undermine the profession by disconnecting teachers from education research. \n\nA profession, not a trade\nNew Zealand\u2019s standalone education colleges merged with universities during the 1990s and early 2000s. In part, the change sought to strengthen teachers\u2019 capacity to critically engage with complex teaching practices and evolving education research. \nLike medicine, law, engineering and architecture, teaching is now considered a profession. This means it has its own distinct body of knowledge, a code of ethics, and an independent governing and registering body.  \nBecoming a member of any profession involves a breadth and complexity of professional learning typically housed within a university. Teachers must learn to engage with research, develop critical thinking, and recognise how their actions \u2013 and the actions of others \u2013 affect learning. \nIndeed, the legally required core characteristics of universities in New Zealand include research, teaching, and their role as \u201ccritic and conscience of society\u201d. These characteristics mean universities can provide an ideal setting for the kind of professional training teachers need. \nUniversity-based teacher education still involves a substantial amount of time on school-based placements. This is where student teachers develop practical skills to complement their wider understanding of education, research and professional knowledge.\nResearch has also found time away from the classroom allows student teachers the space to engage in more abstract levels of critical thinking and personal development. \n\nDevaluing university-based teacher education\nShifting towards school-based training models signals a belief that the knowledge that matters for teacher education is to be found largely or exclusively within schools themselves. \nThis apprenticeship approach requires student teachers to sit \u201cat the side of the master\u201d \u2013 learning primarily by observation and copying what they see. \nApprenticeship learning is an excellent way to approach adult education in many skills and trades. However, in a profession such as teaching it falls short. It adopts a \u201cwhat works\u201d approach without stopping to interrogate who it\u2019s working for and why. \nAn apprenticeship model can also only ever replicate current practice. Given the concern over educational outcomes in New Zealand, there needs to be real change \u2013 not more of the same. \nApprenticeship models typically focus on strategies, curriculum delivery and managing student behaviour. Education research will become less accessible to those in the teaching profession, making it harder to implement any significant change.\nFurthermore, apprenticeship models risk narrowing the teacher education curriculum by focusing on current practices and trends. Rather than being adopted outright, new teaching practices and trends need to be critiqued and examined within their historical, social, cultural and research contexts. \nThe challenge ahead\nProfessionals recognise knowledge will continue to move over time. The best thing we can do is equip new teachers with adaptive expertise \u2014 the ability to think flexibly, to adapt to varied contexts, and to gain new understanding. \nUniversities must have a central place in New Zealand\u2019s teacher education if the profession is to be as strong as is needed.\nThe country needs teacher training to cultivate a worldview comfortable with complexity and with asking questions, seeking feedback, and gaining new understanding on unfamiliar topics. \nThe government needs to support the continual improvement of teacher training in all its forms, including within universities. The education of future generations depends on it.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Universities, Education, Teacher education, Teacher training, Classroom, Apprenticeship, NZ Budget 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

The guideline process was paused in the fall, with experts demanding that only evidence from after 2000 be considered. However, this advice was ignored, and the Task Force continued to disproportionately prioritize aged RCTs and undervalue recent observational trials, which better align with present screening and treatment norms. \nThis diminishes the perceived benefit of screening, as the mortality benefit of screening in RCTs is 15 per cent, compared to 53 per cent in observational trials. The Task Force also tells only part of the story of the benefits of screening by framing its advantages within a limited time span (10 years from entry into screening), and not manifesting the accrued benefits over an individual\u2019s entire lifetime.\nMoreover, the Task Force\u2019s approach to risk assessment is alarmingly simplistic, disregarding individual factors, such as race and ethnicity, breast density and family history. These significantly influence breast cancer risk. \nBut by applying a one-size-fits-all model, they risk misinforming women about their individual risk and denying them access to potentially life-saving screenings, especially racialized women who are significantly more likely to be diagnosed in their 40s.\nPerhaps most concerning is the Task Force\u2019s contention that many cancers identified through screening would not progress or would regress naturally, leading to unnecessary treatments or \u201cover-diagnosis.\u201d This flawed reasoning ignores the reality of untreated cancers that most certainly progress, and disregards medical innovations such as genomic recurrence risk profiling that allow for tailored de-escalation of treatment, minimizing over-treatment. \nWithholding screening based on an unproven theory that a cancer may never cause a problem, when screening provides a clear mortality benefit, is unjustifiable.\nAccess to care\n\nThe Task Force couches all of its recommendations in \u201cshared decision-making,\u201d urging patients and primary-care providers to collaborate to establish what is right for each individual patient. \nIn theory this concept is admirable. However, family physicians look to the Task Force for guidance on how to counsel their patients, and when they receive inaccurate information about the harms and benefits of screening, the power imbalance between provider and patients undermines the informed and shared nature of decision-making. Consequently, women\u2019s access to vital health-care options are limited, perpetuating disparities in breast cancer outcomes.\nIf the harms from treatments faced by individuals are not compelling enough, there is also a financial cost to delaying a breast cancer diagnosis. Work done by researchers in Ottawa showed that the costs of breast cancer management in Ontario vary significantly by stage at diagnosis. From $14,505 for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, a very early stage of breast cancer), to median $39,263, $76,446, $97,668 and $370,398 for Stage I, II, III and IV respectively. In a single-payer public health-care system, these costs significantly outweigh the cost of screening mammography.\nThe updated Task Force guidelines have cast the available science to minimize the benefits of screening and amplify the harms, ultimately denying women access to screening. We believe the consequences of these new guidelines could be dire, with many young women paying with their lives. \nThe majority of provinces and territories have acknowledged these shortcomings, ignoring the existing guidelines, and allowing self-referral for screening for women 40-49, understanding that \u201cshared decision-making\u201d creates barriers for women to access screening, especially in this era of uneven access to primary care. \nHow can it be that the Canadian Cancer Society, the United States and nine provinces in Canada support screening in women 40-49, but our national guidelines do not? Clearly these other bodies have found the data compelling enough to offer screening, so how is it that the Task Force can be the lone voice finding that the harms outweigh the benefits?\nWe believe the new breast cancer recommendations are misguided, and should be viewed as a cautionary tale for all Canadian preventive health. If we do not pivot to heed the call of reason and begin to use only the latest evidence reflecting the advances in treatment and diagnostics used every day in our clinics, we risk lagging behind other countries and witnessing a decline in our cancer outcomes. \nAs cancer clinicians and researchers, none of us would want to be a 40-year-old woman in Canada with these guidelines, given the late-stage incurable breast cancers we see on the oncology wards that could have potentially been prevented by screening.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Breast cancer, Mammography, Breast cancer screening, Women's health, Cancer prevention, Preventive care, Mammogram","role":"assistant"}]}

The most notable of these is the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, which is widely regarded as the most successful environmental agreement ever devised.\nRatified by every UN member state and first adopted in 1987, the Montreal protocol aimed to reduce the release of ozone-depleting substances into the atmosphere. The most well known of these are chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). \nStarting in 1989, the protocol phased out the global production of CFCs by 2010 and prohibited their use in equipment like refrigerators, air-conditioners and insulating foam. This gradual phase-out allowed countries with less established economies time to transition to alternatives and provided funding to help them comply with the protocol\u2019s regulations.\nToday, refrigerators and aerosol cans contain gases like propane which, although flammable, does not deplete ozone in Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere when released. However, ozone-friendly alternatives to CFCs in some products, such as certain foams used to insulate fridges, buildings and air-conditioning units, took longer to find. Another set of gases, hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), was used as a temporary replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, HCFCs still destroy ozone. The good news is that levels of HCFCs in the atmosphere are now falling and indeed have been since 2021 according to research I led with colleagues. This marks a major milestone in the recovery of Earth\u2019s ozone layer \u2013 and offers a rare success story in humanity\u2019s efforts to tackle climate-warming gases too.  \nHCFCs v CFCs\nHCFCs and CFCs have much in common. These similarities are what made the former suitable alternatives. \nHCFCs contain chlorine, the chemical element in CFCs that causes these compounds to destroy the ozone layer. HCFCs deplete ozone to a much smaller extent than the CFCs they have replaced \u2013 you would have to release around ten times as much HCFC to have a comparable impact on the ozone layer. \nBut both CFCs and HCFCs are potent greenhouse gases. The most commonly used HCFC, HCFC-22, has a global warming potential of 1,910 times that of carbon dioxide, but only lasts for around 12 years in the atmosphere compared with several centuries for CO\u2082.\nAs non-ozone depleting alternatives to HCFCs became available it was decided that amendments to the Montreal protocol were needed to phase HCFCs out. These were agreed in Copenhagen and Beijing in 1992 and 1999 respectively.\nThis phase-out is still underway. A global target to end most production of HCFCs is set for 2030, with only very minor amounts allowed until 2040.\nTurning the corner on a bumpy road\nOur findings show that levels of HCFCs in the atmosphere have been falling since 2021 \u2013 the first decline since scientists started taking measurements in the late 1970s. This milestone shows the enormous success of the Montreal protocol in not only tackling the original problem of CFCs but also its lesser known and less destructive successor. \n\nThis is very good news for the ozone layer\u2019s continuing recovery. The most recent scientific prediction, made in 2022, anticipated that HCFC levels would not start falling until 2026.\nDespite HCFC levels in the atmosphere going in the right direction, not everything has been smooth sailing in the phase-out of ozone-depleting substances. In 2019 a team of scientists, including myself, provided evidence that CFC-11, a common constituent of foam insulation, was still being used in parts of China despite the global ban on production. \nThe United Nations Environment Programme also reported that HCFCs were illegally produced in 2020 contrary to the phase-down schedule. \nIn 2023, I and others showed that levels of five more CFCs were increasing in the atmosphere. Rather than illegal production, this increase was more likely the result of a different process: a loophole in the Montreal protocol which allowed CFCs to be produced if they are used to make other substances, such as plastics or non-ozone depleting alternatives to CFCs and HCFCs. \nSome HCFCs at very low levels in the atmosphere have also been shown to be increasing or not falling fast enough, despite few or no known uses. \nMost of the CFCs and HCFCs still increasing in the atmosphere are released in the production of fluoropolymers \u2013 perhaps best known for their application in non-stick frying pans \u2013 or hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). \nHFCs are the ozone-friendly alternative that was developed and commercialised in the early 1990s to replace HCFCs, but their role as a potent greenhouse gas means that they are subject to international climate emission reduction treaties such as the Paris agreement and the Kigali amendment to the Montreal protocol.\nThe next best alternative to climate-warming HFCs is a matter of ongoing discussion. In many applications, it was thought that HFCs would be replaced by hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs), but these have created their own environmental problems in the formation of trifluoroacetic acid which does not break down in the environment and, like other poly- and per-fluorinated substances (PFAS), may pose a risk to human health. \n\nHFOs are at least more energy-efficient refrigerants than older alternatives like propane, however.\nHope for the future\nIn discovering this fall in atmospheric levels of HCFCs, I feel like we may be turning the final corner in the global effort to repair the ozone layer. There is still a long way to go before it is back to its original state, but there are now good reasons to be optimistic.\nClimate and optimism are two words rarely seen together. But we now know that a small group of potent greenhouse gases called HCFCs have been contributing less and less to climate change since 2021 \u2013 and look to set to continue this trend for the foreseeable future. \nWith policies already in place to phase down HFCs, there is hope that environmental agreements and international cooperation can work in combating climate change.\n\n\nDon\u2019t have time to read about climate change as much as you\u2019d like?\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

The last 14 years of Conservative policy have introduced restrictive policies on both legal and irregular migration. And yet, net migration stands at 685,000, a near historic high.\nSince the Conservatives entered office in 2010 and introduced a pledge to reduce net migration, these targets have been part of the political conversation. The general election campaign so far suggests not much has changed. \n2010-2015: Net migration and the hostile environment\nThe 2010 general election put immigration front and centre of the political landscape for the next 14 years. \nNew Labour had previously pursued a managed migration system, which combined strict asylum policies with a more liberal approach to economic immigration. This included allowing citizens of the newly joined EU member states unfettered access to the UK labour market. This, along with a points-based system, had added 2.5 million foreign born workers to the UK population since 1997, transforming the country.\n\n\n\n\n\nBy 2010, the Conservative party had decided to place immigration at the centre of their campaign, with a simple pledge: reduce net migration (the number of people coming to the UK to live, minus the number leaving to move elsewhere) from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands. \nAs the next 14 years showed, this was a gamble that never paid off. Net migration targets have never been reached but the pledge was too politically risky to abandon.\n\n\nWant more election coverage from The Conversation\u2019s academic experts? Over the coming weeks, we\u2019ll bring you informed analysis of developments in the campaign and we\u2019ll fact check the claims being made. \nSign up for our new, weekly election newsletter, delivered every Friday throughout the campaign and beyond.\n\nWhen the 2010 election delivered a Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition, the new government set out to achieve this target through restrictive policies across all streams of immigration.\nLabour\u2019s points-based system technically remained in place, but was curtailed with strict eligibility requirements. The coalition government restricted international student visas by limiting freedom to work during and after studies, restricting family dependants to only postgraduate students and making it harder to switch to work visas. \nThey also introduced more stringent English language requirements and got tough on alleged misuse of the student system (with suggestions of people entering Britain to work on a study visa), as well as family reunification, by cracking down on sham marriages. \nBut these reforms paled in significance compared to the efforts to reduce labour immigration. The government closed the tier 1 visa that allowed highly skilled migrants to seek work in the UK without a job offer. They made the main work visa for sponsored graduate employment only, increasing salary requirements and making permanent settlement much harder. The pinnacle of the reforms was introducing, for the first time in UK history, a limit on the number of work visas that could be issued (20,700 a year).\nThe defining immigration policy approach of this era was the hostile environment. Established by Theresa May in 2012 when she was home secretary, this approach was intended to make life \u201cas difficult as possible\u201d for irregular migrants (people coming to the UK without documentation or authorisation). But its policies have affected all non-citizens, and some citizens to this day. \nCrystallised in two laws \u2013 the 2014 Immigration Act and 2016 Immigration Act \u2013 this set of policies added elements of immigration control to existing systems. For example, the right-to-rent scheme required landlords to check immigration status and prohibited irregular migrants from renting. They were also barred from obtaining driving licenses and opening bank accounts. \nThese policies had no effect on migration levels. They have, however, led to a spike in racial discrimination and, ultimately, the Windrush scandal which wrongly targeted British residents caught out by new documentation rules.\n2015: Brexit and beyond\nDespite this raft of restrictive policies, the Conservatives headed into the 2015 general election with net migration 75,000 higher than they inherited.\nWith limited government control over EU mobility and the electoral threat of anti-migrant, Eurosceptic Ukip on the rise, David Cameron pledged a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU. Concerns over immigration were a key, but not the only factor in the result. \nOnce the UK voted to leave the EU, May (now prime minister) set about negotiating the terms of the deal. Early on in the process, she tied herself to ending free movement. This had an immediate impact on the labour market, which had long relied on EU citizens filling shortages in sectors like social care, hospitality, retail, agriculture and manufacturing. But EU citizens leaving the UK were quickly replaced by a rise in immigration from non-EU countries. \n\n2019: the Johnson years to today\nThe newly elected Boris Johnson set out the government\u2019s post-Brexit immigration policy, a vision of \u201cglobal Britain\u201d. This took the form of an \u201cAustralian-style points-based system\u201d. The new system made no distinction between EU and non-EU citizens, but it was broadly the same as the one it replaced, with a new skilled worker visa. (Labour\u2019s points-based system was never officially terminated, by this point it had become a points-based system in name only). \nJohnson kept the goal of reducing net migration, but dropped a specific target number. And, recognising the labour shortages left by ending free movement, his government liberalised some aspects of economic immigration policy.\nThis involved reducing salary and skills thresholds, introducing new visas in public services and for startups, and bringing back post-study work visas and seasonal worker visas. But labour shortages continued, and the government backtracked on a number of policies \u2013 including a U-turn in 2021 to expand seasonal visas to poultry workers and HGV drivers to \u201csave Christmas\u201d. \n\nPartly as a result of the increase in study and work visas, net migration reached its highest-ever level in 2022, and remained high in 2023. This was primarily due to increases in skilled workers in health and social care, international students (possibly due to opening the post-study work visa) and humanitarian visas introduced for people from Hong Kong and Ukraine.\nWith conflict in the Conservative party intensifying over immigration, the government brought in more dramatic restrictions in 2024. This included barring care workers and postgraduate international students from being able to bring their dependants, and increasing the salary threshold for skilled workers and family visas.   \nThe immigration system as it has evolved over the last 14 years has been ad hoc, piecemeal and reactive to populist politics. It has been largely cut off from other policies affecting the labour market (especially in the NHS and social care), as well as the education and training of UK workers. An alarming consequence of this has been the levels of migrant worker exploitation in these sectors.\nAt the same time, the rhetoric on migration has become more polarising and toxic, and the goal of reducing net migration has persisted.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Migration, UK politics, Net migration, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

As a result, about 3 in 4 expecting mothers follow their doctor\u2019s advice. \nBut even though they\u2019re crucial for the health of mother and baby alike, prenatal supplements are not evaluated for safety and efficacy in the same way that foods and drug products are. There are no rules that require these supplements to contain any nutrients at all, let alone the appropriate doses.\nNot surprisingly, research shows that none of the most widely available over-the-counter prenatal supplements \u2013 whether they are tablets, capsules, soft gels or gummies \u2013 provide adequate levels of five key nutrients: folic acid, iron, vitamin D, calcium and docosahexaenoic acid, a member of the family of omega-3 fatty acids. \nAll of these nutrients are recommended by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists, and getting enough of them is associated with improved health outcomes for both pregnant patients and their babies.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a family medicine resident with a Ph.D. in nutrition, I began investigating these products after my patients started asking questions about them. I discovered that many of the critical nutrients required during pregnancy were missing from these products. Meanwhile, other supplements had insufficient or excessive amounts.\n\nFolate\nFolate, which lowers the rate of birth defects by 50%, is the central reason why prenatal supplements were developed.\nBut folate only prevents birth defects when it\u2019s taken prior to the 28th day of pregnancy. In other words, certain birth defects are prevented only when a woman is taking a prenatal supplement before she knows she\u2019s pregnant.\nFor this reason, the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that women start taking prenatal supplements at least three months prior to pregnancy. \nHowever, only about one-third of women do \u2013 and just 10% of African American women. For them, the folate intended to prevent birth defects arrives too late.\nEven women who do take supplements early in pregnancy might not get the nutrients they need. That includes 400 micrograms of folic acid \u2013 a synthetic version of folate \u2013 from their daily prenatal supplement. As many as 27% of prenatal supplements contain less than that amount.\nOn the other hand, while rare, it\u2019s not impossible to find products that contain more than 1 milligram of folic acid \u2013 a potentially dangerous amount associated with impaired cognitive development, most notably decreased verbal skills.\nOmega-3 fatty acids\nAfter their introduction in the 1980s as a simple multivitamin with a little extra folic acid, prenatal supplements have evolved to deliver an additional nutritional punch. One of those additions, omega-3 fatty acids, serve as building blocks for the construction of the fetal brain. Indeed, 40% of the human brain is comprised of omega-3s.\nOne study of rats showed that insufficient intakes of omega-3s during pregnancy resulted in a significant decrease in omega-3 levels in the mother\u2019s brain. While such a study could never be conducted in humans, this suggests mothers may sacrifice omega-3s from their own brain to support their baby\u2019s brain development.\nBut other studies connecting low levels of omega-3s to postpartum depression, a child\u2019s intellect or other significant outcomes have yielded mixed results. \nHowever, there does appear to be a link between omega-3s and preterm birth, with increased intakes leading to a decreased risk. Preterm birth \u2013 delivery at less than 37 weeks gestation \u2013 is on the rise in the U.S. and worldwide, with more than 1 in 10 babies born too early. \nNew guidelines recommend that pregnant women who don\u2019t routinely eat enough omega-3 fatty acids should get 600-1,000 milligrams of omega-3s daily. Studies have shown  that this is nearly impossible to find in a prenatal supplement.\nHowever, patients who eat fatty fish twice weekly \u2013 this can be salmon, mackerel, herring, sardines or anchovies \u2013 may only need an additional 100-200 milligrams daily of omega-3s during pregnancy. And about 40% of commercial prenatal supplements provide this amount. \nBut most Americans don\u2019t eat two servings of fatty fish weekly. So 95% of pregnant and lactating women in the U.S. aren\u2019t getting enough omega-3s. While many women avoid fish in pregnancy due to concerns around mercury, fatty fish that contain omega-3s are low in mercury and are not among the varieties of fish that should be avoided in pregnancy.\n\nCholine\nCholine is also critical for fetal brain development. Its requirement increases during pregnancy to 450 milligrams per day, and even more so during lactation \u2013 550 milligrams per day. \nWith the exception of organ meats, like beef liver, few foods have enough choline to meet that requirement. An egg contains about 150 milligrams of choline, a 3-ounce steak has 117, and a half cup of soybeans has 107. Salmon, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, green peas and kidney beans also have some choline. \nBecause these are not large amounts, pregnant women need to eat several choline-rich foods daily, and probably need a supplement to meet the recommended amount.  \nBut apparently, almost none do: 95% of pregnant women consume inadequate amounts of choline, and more than half of prenatal supplements have no choline. Those that do typically provide far too little of it \u2013 less than 100 milligrams. \nWhat\u2019s more, some research suggests that consuming even more choline than guidelines recommend could offer additional benefits.\nOne study showed that doubling the recommended level in the third trimester of pregnancy may improve a child\u2019s attention span. Another found that some of the effects of fetal alcohol syndrome may be mitigated with quadruple the recommended level of choline. \nSolutions\nThese three examples clearly demonstrate that taking prenatal supplements doesn\u2019t guarantee a nutritionally adequate pregnancy.\nPart of the problem is a lack of education: Doctors are taught very little in medical school about nutrition, and I\u2019ve observed that most patients just assume they\u2019re getting what they need from their prenatal supplements.\nBecause there are no regulatory standards for these products, there\u2019s no incentive to improve them. No one is mandating that these companies change their formulation, so it\u2019s not a priority for them.\nMy intention here is not to discredit these products, but rather to show that they alone are not enough.\nFinding the best supplement with just the right amount of each nutrient \u2013 not too much and not too little \u2013 is difficult, if not impossible. Even price is not an indicator of quality. \nTo make sure they are getting enough of these nutrients, anyone who is pregnant, or planning to become pregnant, should do these three things: \n1) Choose a prenatal supplement with no more and no less than the recommended 400 micrograms of folic acid daily, and take it for three months prior to conception. \n2) Eat two weekly servings of fatty fish and consider taking a daily omega-3 fatty acid supplement of 100-200 milligrams. Or if you don\u2019t routinely eat fatty fish, take a supplement containing 600-1,000 milligrams. \n3) Gauge their current intake of choline-rich foods, and if they fall short, consider taking a choline supplement.\nGetting adequate nutrition during your pregnancy takes a tremendous amount of effort, and it may seem like you\u2019re on your own.\nI give my patients a guide to help them navigate their nutritional needs during pregnancy. This can help provide the information needed to overcome the inadequacies of prenatal supplements.\nThis article was updated on June 4, 2024, to clarify the U.S. government\u2019s minimal role in the oversight of prenatal supplements.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Pregnancy, Nutrition, multivitamins, Folate, Preterm birth, Lactation, Pregnancy nutrition, Pregnant women, Omega-3","role":"assistant"}]}

Mifepristone has long been used safely and effectively in medication abortions around the world.\nShortly after the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned 50 years of abortion rights, anti-abortion groups and doctors challenged the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s 2000 approval of mifepristone and its loosened regulations on how mifepristone is prescribed, arguing that it could not be used safely.\nThe Conversation asked professors of law Naomi Cahn and Sonia Suter to explain how the Supreme Court case came about and what the ruling means for access to abortion pills and abortion more generally. \nHow did this case get to the court?\nIn Food and Drug Administration v. Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, the plaintiffs argued that the FDA had not adequately tested mifepristone for safety. They also claimed that the FDA\u2019s subsequent changes, which made the drug even more widely available, were also flawed. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2016, the FDA expanded the time frame for prescription of mifepristone from seven weeks to 10 weeks gestation and allowed nonphysician health care providers, like nurse practitioners, to prescribe the pill. Then, in 2021, the FDA removed the in-person dispensing requirement and allowed certified pharmacies to distribute it.\n\nWhat does the decision mean?\nAs a result of the opinion, the use of mifepristone remains legal in the states that have not banned abortion. \nAs of June 2024, medication abortion accounts for more than 60% of abortions in the U.S.\nIn its ruling, the court decided that the plaintiffs did not have standing. Standing is the legal doctrine that limits the type of cases that courts can hear to ones where there are clear and concrete harms to the parties involved. \nThe court explained the requirement of standing by quoting the late Justice Antonin Scalia, who stated that plaintiffs need to answer \u201ca basic question: \u2018What\u2019s it to you?\u2019\u201d \nJustice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s opinion for the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 standing for several reasons. First, it noted that the plaintiffs \u201cdo not prescribe or use mifepristone\u201d and that the \u201cFDA has not required the plaintiffs to do anything or to refrain from doing anything.\u201d Thus, they are \u201cunregulated parties who seek to challenge FDA\u2019s regulation of others.\u201d \nThe court ended by noting that even if no one has standing in this particular  case, the issue may \u201cbe left to the political or democratic processes\u201d through which opponents can voice their \u201cconcerns and objections.\u201d  \nJustice Clarence Thomas concurred, agreeing with the rest of the court while also writing separately to point out that the doctors did not have standing here, just as he believes \u201cabortionists lack standing to assert the rights of their clients.\u201d\n\nWhy is this opinion significant?\nThis case is important because it is the first full Supreme Court opinion since the court\u2019s 2022 opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and found no federal right to an abortion.\nIn holding that the plaintiffs lacked standing, the court did not address the merits of the claim. This means that the decision maintains the status quo in terms of FDA regulation of abortion pills. \nBut it is important to emphasize that the opinion did not take on legal questions concerning the validity of the FDA regulations or any other question concerning the FDA\u2019s authority, which means many questions remain unanswered. For example, it is not fully clear to what extent the FDA regulations take precedence over state regulations regarding the prescription of mifepristone, which is at the heart of some of the lower court cases.\nNevertheless, for the moment, the FDA allows mifepristone to be mailed via certified pharmacies and to be prescribed without in-person visits; up to 10 weeks gestation; and by nonphysician health care providers, like nurse practitioners.\nMight there be other cases involving abortion pills?\nOther cases involving abortion pills are already in lower courts.\nFirst, three states \u2013 Idaho, Kansas and Missouri \u2013 have indicated that they are ready to challenge the FDA\u2019s decision-making on mifepristone, so the issues in this case might be back at the Supreme Court.\nSecond, states are already restricting access to the abortion pills. In May 2024, Louisiana made the decision to treat both mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled substances, meaning that the legislature concluded \u2013 albeit without scientific evidence \u2013 that there are dependence and abuse risks involved in taking the medication. Both pills are used for purposes other than medication abortion.\nThird, a federal court judge in North Carolina recently upheld some of the state\u2019s restrictions on medication abortion. This includes a requirement for an in-person consultation 72 hours in advance of the prescription, as well as an in-person examination and ultrasound before prescription. The judge\u2019s reasoning was that  these requirements seemingly concerned issues \u201cbeyond regulating the safe use of mifepristone,\u201d such as regulating the medical profession.\nOn the other hand, she struck down the parts of the North Carolina law that prevented patients from receiving the pills through pharmacies and taking them at home. She also blocked the requirement of an in-person follow-up appointment. In her view, these conflicted with the FDA decision to remove those requirements.\nFourth, under a Trump administration, the FDA could decide to revert to the old requirements for prescribing mifepristone. That would be a \u201chighly unusual\u201d approach, but nothing bars that possibility. Moreover, it is a strategy explicitly recommended by anti-abortion activists. \nFinally, there is the issue of the meaning and application of an 1873 Victorian statute, the Comstock Act, which criminalizes the mailing or shipping of any \u201clewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile article\u201d and anything that \u201cis advertised or described in a manner \u2026 for producing abortion.\u201d Anti-abortion groups believe this applies to mifepristone. \nThe Department of Justice, under the Biden administration, has interpreted the statute as only applying if the sender knows the recipient plans to use the pills \u201cillegally\u201d for abortion. However, under another administration, the DOJ might view the reach of the Comstock Act more broadly.. \nAs we have noted before, a broad reading of the act could go beyond a prohibition on mailing the pills, even where abortion is legal; it might also apply to the distribution of any drug or medical tool \u2013 beyond just mifepristone \u2013 used to perform an abortion. These same tools are also used for other types of obstetrics and gynecology care. This could have the effect of banning abortion across the country, even where states allow abortions..\nWhile the short-term consequences of the ruling leave mifepristone available where it is legal, this is not the last word on access to medication abortion.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Abortion, US Supreme Court, Abortion rights, SCOTUS, Abortion pills, Mifepristone, Anti-abortion, Dobbs v.

Shields became dangerously low on sodium while preparing for her show by drinking loads of water. \u201cI flooded my system and I drowned myself,\u201d she would later explain. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t have enough sodium in your blood or urine or your body, you can have a seizure.\u201d \nShields said she found herself walking around outside for \u201cno reason at all\u201d, wondering: \u201cWhy am I out here?\u201d\n\nThen I walk into the restaurant and go to the sommelier who had just taken an hour to watch my run through.

Then my hands drop to my side and I go headfirst into the wall.\n\nShields added that she was \u201cfrothing at the mouth, totally blue, trying to swallow my tongue\u201d.\n\nLike Shields, many people may be unaware of the dangers of drinking excessive amounts of water \u2013 especially because hydration is so often associated with health benefits. Models and celebrities often advocate drinking lots of water to help maintain clear, smooth skin. Some social media influencers have promoted drinking a gallon of water daily for weight loss. \n\n\n\n\n\nBut excessive water consumption can cause hyponatraemia  \u2013 a potentially fatal condition of low sodium in the blood.\nWorried about hydration levels? Check your urine\nThe body strictly regulates its water content to maintain the optimum level of total body water and \u201cosmolality\u201d \u2013 the concentration of dissolved particles in your blood. Osmolality increases when you are dehydrated and decreases when you have too much fluid in your blood. \nOsmolality is monitored by osmoreceptors that regulate sodium and water balance in the hypothalamus \u2013 the part of the brain that controls numerous hormones. These osmoreceptors signal the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), which acts on blood vessels and the kidneys to control the amount of water and salt in the body. \n\nIn healthy people, the body releases ADH when osmolality becomes high. ADH tells the kidneys to reabsorb water, which makes urine more concentrated. The reabsorbed water dilutes the blood, bringing osmolality back to normal levels. \nLow blood osmolality suppresses the release of ADH, reducing how much water the kidneys reabsorb. This dilutes your urine, which the body then passes to rid itself of the excess water.\nHealthy urine should be clear and odourless. Darker, yellower urine with a noticeable odour can indicate dehydration \u2013 although medications and certain foods, including asparagus, can affect urine colour and odour, too.\nHow much is too much?\nAdults should consume two-to-three litres per day, of which around 20% comes from food. However, we can lose up to ten litres of water through perspiration \u2013 so sweating during exercise or in hot weather increases the amount of water we need to replace through drinking. \nSome medical conditions can cause overhydration. Approximately one in five schizophrenia patients drink water compulsively, a dangerous condition known as psychogenic polydipsia. One long-term study found that patients with psychogenic polydipsia have a \u201c74% greater chance of dying before a non-polydipsic patient\u201d.\nIn some cases, people with anorexia nervosa can also suffer from compulsive water drinking.\n\nFor those suffering from polydipsia, treatment is focused on medication to reduce the urge to drink, as well as increasing sodium levels. This should be done gradually to avoid causing myelinolysis \u2013 neurological damage caused by rapid changes in sodium levels in nerve cells.\nIn rare but often highly publicised cases such as that of Leah Betts in 1995, some users of the illegal drug MDMA (also known as ecstasy) have died after drinking copious amounts of water to rehydrate after dancing and sweating. \nThe drug increases body temperature, so users drink water to avoid overheating. Unfortunately, MDMA also triggers the unnecessary release of ADH, causing water retention. The body becomes unable to rid itself of excess water, which affects its electrolyte levels \u2013 causing cells to swell with water.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      How does MDMA kill?\n\n\n\n\nSymptoms of water intoxication start with nausea, vomiting, blurred vision and dizziness. As the condition progresses, sufferers can often display symptoms of psychosis, such as inappropriate behaviour, confusion, delusions, disorientation and hallucinations. \nThese symptoms are caused by hyponatraemia, where sodium levels are diluted or depleted in blood and the subsequent imbalance of electrolytes affects the nervous system. Water begins to move into the brain causing a cerebral oedema \u2013 brain swelling because of excessive fluid buildup, which is usually fatal if not treated.\nA healthy body will tell you when it needs water. If you\u2019re thirsty and your urine is dark with a noticeable odour, then you need to drink more. If you aren\u2019t thirsty and your urine is clear or the colour of light straw, then you\u2019re already doing a good job of hydrating yourself.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Water, Health, Drinking water, Hydration, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

If they are deemed to pose a significant threat to the community, a package is prepared and shared with the police, who are notified about the release. \nPolice may then apply to the courts for a judicial order and the individual is told they must enter an agreement to be supervised. These orders might include conditions that forbid drinking or staying out past a curfew, for example. Courts can also require community notifications. \nThese notifications are meant to let the public know that an individual is being released in their community. People convicted of crimes are released from prison every day, either after completing their full sentence or while being supervised under parole. \nMembers of the public might often react negatively to community notifications about people released from prison, especially if the individual has a violent past. Research has shown that the public is most outraged and misperceive risk for reoffending when the individual committed a violent or sexual crime, and it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s a sexual crime against children.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunity notifications\nCommunity notifications are intended to be helpful by informing the public. However, they can also make reintegrating back into the community challenging for released individuals.\nNotifications to the public are seen as the \u201cleast draconian\u201d option by some when it comes to dealing with repeat offenders compared to a lifetime or lengthy period of supervision, such as being designated a dangerous or long-term offender.\nHowever, you can only imagine what an incarcerated individual might think when they are told: \u201cYou\u2019ve done your time and you will be released, but now we\u2019re going to supervise you for another year or two, and this time it will be under the watchful eye of a police officer \u2014 and everyone in the community will know your name, your face and what you did. Good luck with keeping your nose clean and avoiding another arrest.\u201d\nPeople who have completed their prison sentences and are released are no longer in the provincial or federal correctional system, and bodies like the National Parole Board have no jurisdiction over them. So police are then expected to manage any public safety risk that released individuals may pose.\nYet, police are primarily trained on enforcing the law, investigating criminal activity and addressing emergency situations as they arise. There is little training on managing offenders and engaging in rehabilitation to lower their risk to themselves or others. \n\nHelping offenders reintegrate\nIf police integrate certain principles in their practices, they can effectively address and reduce risk for harm. These evidence-based principles, which are called risk, need and responsivity principles, tell us is that police should direct more attention to higher risk individuals, spend more time targeting risk factors that cause criminal behaviour and learn to build better relationships and rapport with offenders. This would be further effective using a multi-agency approach to help offenders reintegrate into society.\nResearch has shown that police do quite well when they use risk assessments. When they focus their attention on risk factors like substance abuse, marital conflicts and monitoring criminal associations, and when they are compassionate and use trauma-informed approaches, risk for violent and sexual offending is more likely reduced. \nOf course, risk management and reintegration pose many challenges. Police have to help stabilize people\u2019s lives by effectively helping them find sustainable work and positive activities.\nPeople with convictions may face difficulty finding suitable housing or getting into treatment programs that help with substance abuse and mental health. The pressure to ensure stability is most critical within the first few months after release.\nSupervising and supporting violent offenders is not an easy task or an easy sell to the public. Our research has shown that it doesn\u2019t matter how we present information, the public is less inclined to see any merit in reintegration or rehabilitation. \nHowever, with specialized training, police can be instrumental in reducing risk. And with the support of the community, released offenders are more likely to gain stability and live a productive crime-free life. These are goals that we all share as members of our community.\nGregory Kitura, a sergeant with the Edmonton Police Service, co-authored this article.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Policing, Prison, Rehabilitation, offenders, Prisoners, Reintegration, Notifications","role":"assistant"}]}

There is the civilian cost of the current military incursion into Rafah. There is the unthinkable humanitarian cost if famine or disease becomes worse. And there is the massive damage to Gaza itself as a place that can sustain a human population after the war is over.\nLastly, multicultural and immigrant nations, like the US, Australia and others, have many people with personal ties to one side or the other. People who see the conflict through very different lenses might live, work and play alongside each other in our communities. This makes conflicts even more likely.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      What is it about Gaza? Wars are raging around the world, so why are young people so passionate about this one?\n\n\n\n\nOur current moment\nBut must all this add up to charges of intimidation, provocation and racism? Three features of our current cultural moment are likely causing these disagreements to become even more vitriolic:\n\nWe are all politically active, and publicly so. Ordinary people and organisations routinely take public moral stands on charged issues. Even the absence of a public statement can be notable.\nThere is a pronounced social concern for vulnerable groups and their safety, especially when minorities face identity-based discrimination and oppressive speech.   \nThere is an increased willingness, super-charged through social media, to use \u201csocial punishment\u201d against opposing views. This can include efforts at cancelling, disrupting, shouting down, blackballing, doxing, lawfare, public shaming through vitriolic abuse and other efforts to inflict harms on perceived wrongdoers. Some partisans even feel justified in threatening violence.\n\nThese three features have become interconnected in our current climate. Seeing society as an us-and-them struggle between good and evil can drive people to take public stances, and to socially punish the perceived oppressors.\nThese features were apparent in movements against systemic racism (such as the Black Lives Matter protests in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody) and sexism (the #Metoo movement). And we are seeing it now with the Gaza war, as well.\n\nWhat\u2019s different this time?\nA crucially different feature of the current controversy is that both sides can and do freely employ these features against each other. \nThis is a change. Previously, the main opposition to the above three cultural features came from centre-left critics who largely agreed with the goals of progressive movements, but disagreed with their methods. \nFor example, Yasha Mounk, author of The Identity Trap, acknowledged the need for a reckoning on racial justice, but criticised the use of public shaming and cancel culture. As he himself observed, this ambivalence about the ends and means of progressive movements often prevented critics like him from mounting assertive, full-frontal attacks on their opponents.\nIn contrast, the Israel-Gaza conflict sees both sides wielding uncompromising language, concepts and methods against each other. Both Jews and Palestinians have faced undeniable bigotries (antisemitism, Islamophobia), and have responded by publicly calling out this racism.\nA social system in which people take such public moral stances, target identity-based oppression and employ social punishment against perceived wrongdoers can be relatively stable, provided there is widespread agreement about who counts as oppressors and the oppressed. \nBut in the current controversy, both sides can plausibly claim they are the persecuted minority. After all, the Jewish people had a long history of persecution even before the horrors of the Holocaust, and Israel has been surrounded by countries violently opposed to its existence since its inception. \nAnd compared to Israel\u2019s military might, the Palestinians plainly suffer from systemic oppression and deadly violence. This will seem especially true to those who see Israel as an oppressive \u201csettler colony\u201d \u2013 invaders aiming to permanently replace the existing locals.\nOnce there is direct disagreement about which party counts as the oppressed group, conflicts can quickly escalate. \nEach side is righteously sensitive to any perceived hate speech from the other, but unwilling to limit their own punitive strategies or inflammatory language. After all, why should the victims have to curb their language and methods to suit the oppressors? \n\nTit-for-tat escalations\nUsing social punishment to achieve policy goals can also sometimes shade into coercive force. \nAt low levels, disruptive and rule-breaking protests can help publicise a political message and communicate its importance. But the more disruptive a protest becomes, it takes on the unvarnished threat of a protection racketeer: we will make running your operations impossible unless you submit to our demands.\nWorse still, once one side steps outside the bounds of normal rules and expectations \u2014 such as through disruptive or intimidating protests or attempts to get others fired \u2014the other side righteously retaliates, trading accusations of racism and bigotry. \nThere is no longer just a conflict, but a conflict about the conflict.\nLanguage, power, humanity\nAnd this perhaps leaves us with the final ethical concern. Even if it is right, sometimes, to judge people based on their group membership, and to be sensitive to the role of systemic power, people are individuals, too. It still matters how each individual is treated, not as a place-holder for a group, and not as responsible for the group\u2019s sins.\nJust because a person might be in the right politically doesn\u2019t mean that what they are doing for their cause is permissible morally. \nThere are no easy answers here. In a multicultural and pluralistic country, we can\u2019t prevent others having different views, and we can\u2019t shy away from the sharp disagreements those differences will create. \nBut we can at least remember we are all human, and put limits on intimidating, haranguing, ostracising and threatening others, even as we tolerate their rights to protest and criticise the things we hold most sacred.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Gaza, Antisemitism, Islamophobia, Student protests, Doxing, Cancel culture, Israeli-Palestine Conflict, Gaza war","role":"assistant"}]}

In service of this mission, the order fused two defining institutions of the early Middle Ages: the mounted knight and the pious monk. \nAt the time, this made the Templars something of a puzzle. How could someone be both a pious monk and a ferocious warrior? The Templars themselves tried to address this question in their symbology, which proved as puzzling as the order itself. \n\nOne of the Templars\u2019 more enigmatic symbols was their wax seal \u2013 two knights riding a single horse. In the Middle Ages, people used seals to protect important communications from forgery, acting like a signature. Everyone from individuals to organizations had their own unique seal. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhile the images on seals could be relatively simple and straightforward, they sometimes conveyed more subtle messages. The message of the Templars\u2019 seal has always been open to interpretation.\nInterpreting the Templar seal\nWhile researching medieval geopolitics and the Third Crusade, I came across several interpretations of the Templar seal. \nThe most popular ties the shared steed to the Templars\u2019 vow of poverty. While the Order was not literally financially constrained, the symbol likely was meant to demonstrate that the Templars took the vow seriously.\nAnother draws a connection to the Gospel of Matthew, where one figure represents a knight and the other Jesus Christ. This interpretation stems from a Bible passage where Christ says, \u201cFor where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I with them.\u201d The idea is that the two knights on a single horse embody the ever-present companionship of Christ with the Templars who had gathered in his name.\nAs part of a campaign to discredit the Templars, some suggested the two knights symbolized the homosexuality said to be rampant within the order.\nSome propose that the two knights represent a duality within the order itself. The single horse could signify the unification of their seemingly contrasting roles as warrior-monk.\nThe seal\u2019s inscription adds another layer of intrigue. Originally, the inscription read \u201cSigillum Militum Christi\u201d \u2013 Latin for \u201cSeal of the Soldiers of Christ.\u201d In the mid-13th century, the order\u2019s 19th grand master changed the inscription to \u201cSigillum Militum Xpisti,\u201d replacing the Latin word for Christ with the Greek. Some scholars argue that using the Greek letters \u201cXP\u201d instead of the Latin \u201cCHR\u201d was intended to invoke Emperor Constantine\u2019s vision at the Battle of the Milvian Bridge in 312 C.E. His victory allowed him to end the official persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire.\n\nMultiple meanings\nWhile the exact meaning of the seal remains a riddle, there is little doubt it served as a powerful symbol of the knights\u2019 commitment to their ideals.\nThe seal\u2019s many interpretations resonate with different audiences. For some, it represents Christian soldiery and unwavering brotherhood. For others, it evokes the enigmatic nature of the Templars. And for others, it suggests corruption and sexual misconduct.\nThe seal serves as a window into the Knights Templar\u2019s identity and impact on medieval Christian history. It is a symbol likely to continue to spark curiosity for centuries to come.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"History, Religion, Christianity, Middle Ages, Medieval history, European history, Crusades, Christian, Quick reads, Knights Templar, Medieval Europe, Picture in 500 words","role":"assistant"}]}

Run hard at the suburban seats, where people are heavily under the financial pump. Abandon the teal seats for the moment. Try to force Anthony Albanese into minority government. Then hope in the next term to exploit whatever instability might arise. \n\n\n\n\n\nThat was the path that took Abbott \u2013 like Dutton, an unlikely Liberal leader \u2013  to government. Of course Dutton would have to hang onto the leadership through a second term in opposition (made a bit easier by not having Josh Frydenberg around). \nDutton\u2019s climate strategy relies on tapping into two major current grievances: the cost-of-living pain and the resistance in many communities to the rollout of renewable energy infrastructure. \nAs opposition leader, Abbott labelled Labor\u2019s carbon pollution reduction scheme as a \u201cgreat big new tax on everything\u201d.  \nDutton has an update on an old theme, attacking the Albanese government\u2019s 43% 2030 emissions reduction target \u2013 Australia\u2019s pledge under the Paris climate agreement \u2013 as set to \u201cdestroy the economy\u201d. \nAbbott\u2019s campaign yielded a political return for him, at a substantial cost for energy policy in Australia. But times have moved on in this never-ending climate debate, and Dutton\u2019s climate policy-walk is through quicksand.    \nA pointed question was asked this week, at an Albanese news conference. Given cost of living was the top issue for people, did Australians want another election fought on climate change? \nProbably not. To bring off his gamble, Dutton will need to convince voters Australia\u2019s climate targets are harming them via their energy bills. Moreover, he\u2019ll need to persuade them the energy transition can be safely slowed, and that nuclear power is credible and desirable. \nThat\u2019s a big selling task. And so far, the opposition has embarked on it with extraordinary sloppiness. \nMonths ago, it flagged it would release its nuclear power policy before the budget. Then that was put off. \nInitially, its nuclear option focused on small modular reactors. Then it switched to larger reactors, to be located on or near coal-fired power stations as they retire. \nIn an interview with last weekend\u2019s Australian newspaper Dutton declared the 2030 target was unachievable. But he did not indicate whether a Coalition government would stay in the Paris agreement. Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien had to clean up, saying a Dutton government would not seek to exit Paris. \nSuch untidiness is a feature of the Dutton opposition, typically opening it to attack by its opponents and leaving the public confused. \nPolitical research will sit behind Dutton\u2019s lines. When we look at the public research, the recently-released Lowy Institute 2024 poll shows a complex picture.\nIn that poll, 57% said global warming was a serious and pressing problem about which \u201cwe should begin taking steps now even if this involves significant costs\u201d.  Only 30% said the problem should be addressed \u201cbut its effects will be gradual so we can deal with the problem gradually by taking steps that are low in cost\u201d. \nThere were age and political differences. The young are more galvanised than the old by the warming \nthreat, as are Labor supporters compared to Coalition supporters. \nBeyond the generalised attitudes, the trends on the related issue of energy are very relevant. Some 48% say reducing household energy bills should be the main priority for the government\u2019s energy policy. This is a 16 point increase from 2021. Those who say reducing carbon emissions should be the main priority have fallen 18 points to 37%. \nThe results show how altered circumstances over time do change people\u2019s priorities (and of course these can change back). \nThe Dutton strategy is a back-end loaded policy, with less effort now (kicking much of the problem into the long grass) and relying on nuclear power after 2040 for a sprint to net zero 2050, a target Dutton says the Coalition still supports. Progress to 2050 doesn\u2019t have to be linear, he says.\nThe government\u2019s argument is that the energy transition, albeit difficult, is urgent and progress must be cumulative; trashing our 2030 target will undermine both investor confidence and Australia\u2019s international reputation. \nDutton says he won\u2019t announce what targets a Coalition government would have until after the election. Clearly such targets, if they ever materialised, would be less than Labor\u2019s. \nThis position would lose the Coalition some votes. Dutton would be relying on other voters not being too fussed about his lack of targets. That would allow him to concentrate on attacking not just the government\u2019s current 2030 target but the 2035 target it has to lodge under the Paris agreement early next year. \nThe government is potentially more vulnerable in the debate over the 2035 target than in the current row over the 2030 one. \nThe Climate Change Authority makes a recommendation by October to Energy Minister Chris Bowen on what the 2035 target should be. In its discussion paper, the  authority has floated a range of 65\u201375% emissions reduction on 2005 levels. The authority believes this \u201ccould be achievable and sustainable if additional action is taken by governments, business, investors and households to achieve it\u201d. \nThat would be a substantial lift in ambition from the 2030 target of 43% reduction, especially given there is dispute about whether that can be reached. \nThe government doesn\u2019t have to accept the authority\u2019s recommendation if it decided it was too high. But if it rejected it, it would open itself to an onslaught from the Greens. \nAs for the Greens, they are saying if a Dutton government tried to backtrack on the current 2030 target, it would breach the legislation the Albanese government passed to enshrine the target. (That could open a Coalition government to legal action, assuming it could not repeal the legislation.)\nIn practice, despite what Dutton says about returning to government in one term, under a two-term strategy he would not anticipate having to face that problem any time soon. The early herculean challenge Dutton does face is selling nuclear power to voters.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Renewable energy, Nuclear energy, Politics, Energy, Peter Dutton, Climate policy, Australia's 2030 climate target, Paris climate agreement, Climate wars, Liberal National Coalition, Anthony Albanese, Australian Liberal Party, Coalition nuclear policy","role":"assistant"}]}

Gordon Granger said as much when he read General Order No. 3 in Galveston, Texas, in front of enslaved people who were among the last to learn of their legal freedom.  \nAccording to the order, the law promised the \u201cabsolute equality of personal rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves.\u201d \nBut the new laws guaranteeing legal protections for equal rights \u2013 starting with the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863 and followed by the ratification of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments after the U.S. Civil War had ended in April 1865 \u2013 did not eliminate the influence of slavery on the laws.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe legacy of slavery is still enshrined in thousands of judicial opinions and briefs that are cited today by American judges and lawyers in cases involving everything from property rights to criminal law.\nFor example, in 2016 a judge on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Prigg v. Pennsylvania, an 1842 U.S. Supreme Court case that held that a state could not provide legal protections for alleged fugitive slaves. The judge cited that case to explain the limits of congressional power to limit gambling in college sports. \nIn 2013, a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals cited Prigg for similar reasons. In that case, involving challenges to an Indian tribe\u2019s acquisition of land, the judge relied on Prigg to explain how to interpret a federal statute. \nNeither of these judges acknowledged or addressed the origins of the Prigg v. Pennsylvania case. \nThat is not unusual. \nWhat I have learned by researching these slave cases is that the vast majority of judges do not acknowledge that the cases they cite involve the enslaved. They also almost never consider how slavery may have shaped legal rules. \nThe Citing Slavery Project\nTo place these laws in historical context for modern-day usage and encourage judges and lawyers to address slavery\u2019s influence on the law, I started the Citing Slavery Project in 2020. Since then, my team of students and I have identified more than 12,000 cases involving enslaved people and more than 40,000 cases that cite those cases. \n\nWe have found dozens of citations of slave cases in the 2010s. Such citations appear in rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and in state courts across the country. Citation by lawyers in briefs is even more prevalent. \nAn ethical obligation?\nAddressing slavery\u2019s legal legacy is not just an issue for historians. \nIt is also an ethical issue for legal professionals. The code of conduct for U.S. judges recognizes that \u201can independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society.\u201d The code further calls for judges to \u201cact at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity \u2026 of the judiciary.\u201d \nLawyers share in this obligation. \nThe American Bar Association notes the profession\u2019s \u201cspecial responsibility for the quality of justice.\u201d It also calls for lawyers to further \u201cthe public\u2019s understanding of and confidence in the rule of law and the justice system.\u201d \n\nSuch actions are particularly important because of the rising importance of the Supreme Court\u2019s history-and-tradition test, which uses analysis of historical traditions to determine modern constitutional rights. Courts risk undermining their legitimacy by paying attention to some legal legacies while ignoring others.  \nIt is my belief that lawyers and judges must confront slavery\u2019s legacy in order to atone for the legal profession\u2019s past actions and to fulfill their ethical duties to ensure confidence in our legal system.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"US law, Freedom, US Civil War, Juneteenth, Emancipation Proclamation, US slavery","role":"assistant"}]}

The question is: will it be for better or worse? It\u2019s already causing some real problems, especially related to \u201cromance scams\u201d and other fraud. \nBut it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. Used in the right way, AI can actually make dating better. It can help write profiles and find matches, provide dating advice and coaching and, if all else fails, become a date companion.\nI have spent the last few years studying the impact of technology, and especially AI, on our romantic lives. And I think this is an exciting time to be single and online.\nThe Kinsey Institute\u2019s annual \u201cSingles in America\u201d survey revealed that 14 per cent of Gen Z-ers, and six per cent of all single people, are already using AI to help with dating. Here are some ways you can use it right now.\n\n\n\n\n\n(1) AI can help you create a dating profile\nSome people are great at making profiles for themselves. They have a knack for writing short self-descriptions that are witty and charming. They can take Instagram-ready selfies, or have friends who are talented photographers. \nFor the rest of us, though, putting together a profile can be a daunting experience. AI can make things easier. It can help you write your bio and edit crappy selfies into presentable photos. It might even edit out that fish you\u2019re holding for some reason.\n\nWhile it may feel deceptive, we should view AI as an equalizer. People who want to spend time and money to improve their profile already have lots of ways to do so. AI can provide fast, free assistance to people who can\u2019t make the same investments. It helps us put our best selves forward.\n(2) AI can act as a style adviser and dating coach\nWhen OpenAI unveiled its latest chatbot, ChatGPT-4o, the demo featured a man on his way to a job interview who asked a bot for feedback on how he looked. New York Times reporter Kevin Roose regularly turns to his AI companions for a \u201cfit check.\u201d \nBut getting advice on your outfits is just the beginning of what AI can do to help you get ready for your big date. It can suggest places to meet or give you a list of interesting things to do. It can also help come up with topics of conversation and rehearse your banter with you. And it can act as a hype man, to give you some inspiration before you head out the door.\n(3) AI can help you find matches\nThe swipe model for dating apps has not changed in a decade. But AI could finally bring some innovation. \nBumble founder Whitney Herd certainly thinks it will. She recently raised the possibility of what she called \u201cAI dating concierges,\u201d bots that can chat with the bots of possible matches on your behalf to determine compatibility. A company called Volar is already offering an early version of this service.\nThe prospect of armies of chatbots all talking to each other might seem dystopian, but compare it to the system we have now where users spend on average between three and seven seconds on a single profile before swiping them away forever. And most of these swipes are, let\u2019s face it, based on the first photo.\n\nAn AI dating assistant could actually give you matches that are based on common interests or other factors more substantial than just looks. You could train the AI to know your personality, and you could give it a sense of what you\u2019re looking for in a partner. It could chat with the AIs of everyone in your vicinity, and, for the people it thinks might be good matches, it can give you transcripts of these chats. You can take over from there, to actually make contact with a human being.\n(4) AI can provide relationship counselling\nDating has its ups and downs. Some of us have a great network of friends or can afford a real-life therapist. Not everyone has these options. AI is always available, even at 2 a.m., when you\u2019ve just been dumped over text. It\u2019s also much cheaper than a human psychologist.\nAs The Verge reported, one of Character.AI\u2019s bots, The Psychologist, \u201cis one of the most popular on the platform and has received more than 95 million messages since it was created.\u201d It\u2019s just one of many AI counsellors now on the market. While the evidence on the effectiveness of AI therapy is preliminary, it\u2019s quite promising.\n(5) AI can actually be your date\nBefore launching ChatGPT-4o, Sam Altman tweeted a single word: \u201cHer.\u201d This may earn him a lawsuit from Scarlett Johansson, since the chatbot used a voice that sounded a lot like her character from the 2013 movie of that name.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      ChatGPT\u2019s use of a soundalike Scarlett Johansson reflects a troubling history of gender-stereotyping in technology\n\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s no accident that the movie, about a man who falls in love with an artificial companion, has become a touchstone in the AI world. People are forming social bonds with chatbots in large numbers. Character AI says that 3.5 million people talk to its bots every day, spending an average of two hours a day on the platform. Another, Replika, reports that it has two million users.\n\nWhile many people have noticed that the new ChatGPT can get awfully flirty, it does not allow explicitly romantic or sexual conversations. But other chatbots do not have the same restrictions. Replika originally offered an \u201cerotic role play\u201d feature, though it it was disabled in 2023 in response to new regulations in Italy. \nBut there\u2019s no shortage of competitors. Alex Cardinell, the chief executive of Nomi, another company that makes companion bots, said more than half of Nomi\u2019s users have at least one romantic A.I. companion. Grindr has announced it\u2019s going to build an AI boyfriend directly into its app.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Increasingly sophisticated AI systems can perform empathy, but their use in mental health care raises ethical questions\n\n\n\n\nAI and the future of dating\nThe prospect of people forming intimate relationships with chatbots raises numerous concerns. Privacy is one of the most pressing. But AI companions also have the potential to improve our lives. \nResearchers at Stanford University conducted a survey of 1,006 student users of Replika. They found that the overwhelming majority believed that their interactions with the chatbot enhanced their lives, and in some cases, even reduced their thoughts of suicide.\nAI assistants and companions won\u2019t be for everyone. But for many people, they can provide a worthwhile addition to their social and romantic lives.\nDating is hard, but as AI gets more sophisticated and becomes integrated into our everyday lives, we shouldn\u2019t be afraid to allow it to lend us a hand. Just don\u2019t forget to thank it at the wedding.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), Relationships, Online dating, Tinder, Chatbots, Bumble, Dating advice, Hinge","role":"assistant"}]}

He would go to the larger men\u2019s prayer hall, while my daughter and I went to the separate women\u2019s section. He was a child, and I had no way of knowing how or where he was until the prayer was over. \nIn the throngs of men exiting the prayer hall I would search for him. The stress and anxiety of being separated from him ultimately led me to stop going with them to the mosque for a period of time.\nI\u2019ve spent over half of my life studying the place and space of women in mosque architecture. My book, Beyond the Divide A Century of Canadian Mosque Design, documents 90 mosques across Canada and the spaces for women within them.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen in mosques\nThe mosques I grew up using in Canada were very different from the historical ones, and the Grand Mosque in Mecca, that I visited as a young scholar. In the few Canadian mosques of my youth, the space for women was always a surprise and in constant flux: a side room, a basement, a backroom \u2014 always with a low ceiling, always with substandard finishes.\nYet, in the historical mosques I visited in Cairo, Istanbul, Tunis, C\u00f3rdoba and elsewhere, I stepped into vast and full spaces where I could see it all, including the mihrab, the niche that indicates the direction of Mecca. If spaces were designated for women in these historical mosques, it was usually with makeshift and new materials: clearly more modern additions to centuries-old buildings that originally welcomed both genders without bifurcated spaces. \nIn Mecca, during my pilgrimage, I prayed and performed the rituals as Muslims have for over 1,400 years, without gender divisions.\nThat disconnect between the historical and modern was real and confusing. In the modern spaces where I should have found community, I found that I was architecturally subjugated. \n\nWhen reading the Qur'an, men and women are called to bow before God in spaces of prostration. Not once does the Qur'an prescribe an architecturally separated space for women. In secondary sources, the Hadith, scholars over the centuries interpreted the actions of the Prophet Muhammed: there are examples of the Prophet asking men to lower their gaze, to arrange mixed gender groups in a certain way or to even shorten prayers to alleviate the discomfort of mothers tending to children.\nThe idea suggesting it is better for women to pray at home only came along late in the 13th century, as a cultural interpretation by Muslim jurist Ibn Jawzi \u2014 not a religious order. For the first millennium of the Islamic faith, mosques were constructed without gender separation. Ample historical texts document the presence of women scholars learning and teaching in mosque spaces. \nIn fact, the popularization of specifically designed separate women\u2019s spaces in mosques only began in the Ottoman era. In the 15th century, with the conquering of Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul), the 1,000-year-old Byzantine church of Hagia Sophia was converted into a mosque. \nHagia Sophia, like many other Byzantine churches, had distinctive separate spaces for women to pray in \u2014 including the balcony, or gynaeceum; an element that was not carried over in subsequent eras of church design. Ottoman mosques post-Hagia Sophia were constructed using many Byzantine elements, including the dome most associated with mosques today. Among these elements, was also the separate balcony space of some proportion or size reserved for women. \n\nMosques in Canada\nOver the course of my research, I\u2019ve travelled to and examined 90 mosques in 53 cities across Canada \u2014 from Victoria to St. John\u2019s to Inuvik and Iqaluit. I interviewed mosque patrons, board members and designers. I photographed each mosque space (exterior and interior), created architectural drawings (with my research assistants) that noted gender demarcation and learned the history of each space.\nIn most mosques I was welcomed wholeheartedly. In others, I was met with trepidation or doubt. Overall, my academic credentials neutralized my gender and \u201callowed\u201d me access to male spaces. Meanwhile my gender allowed me entry and use of women\u2019s spaces that are almost never discussed or analyzed in architecture texts. \n\nWomen\u2019s spaces in Canadian mosques range from having a full view of the main prayer hall, to some view to none. In the mosques I studied, only around 15 per cent afforded women a full view of the main space, just under 40 per cent some view and the remaining 46 per cent afforded women no view at all. \nWomen in Canada (and many other parts of the world) frequently enter mosques unsure of what kind of space awaits them. Will there be reasonable room to pray? Will the space be well-lit and maintained? These questions limit inclusion and pose a serious social and architectural problem. \nArchitects and designers may hesitate to question a mosque design brief given to them from fear of being insensitive, but accepting a brief to design spaces that treat members of the community unequally is a problem and requires professional critique. If an architect was asked to design a gym or library where women could only access a quarter of the space with poorer quality furnishings, would the architect not question this?\nBuilding codes regulate the baseline of expectations for spaces, however none exist regarding the gendering of sacred spaces \u2014 thus the extreme range is possible: from minuscule and poor allocation to unbarred equal space. Architects and communities, in dialogue, must understand what the impact of architectural decisions are. \n\nMosques with walls, barriers and separated entrances all send a clear message to Muslim women: these spaces are not designed to include us. For mosques to remain spaces that are relevant and important to younger generations, they must adapt and learn from the historical non-gendered norms. Attendance and participation cannot be sustained under such conditions \u2014 especially by younger people who find themselves equal everywhere else but the mosque.  \nMosques without gender separation have more engagement from all members of the community. These mosques function like community hubs and are active throughout the week for a wide range of community activities.\nIn early 2023, I was asked to join as an architecture of Islam design consultant on a large mosque and school project in Edmonton. The school and mosque will accommodate 1,500 to 2,000 people. The community has been positively engaged in the design process, with students, teachers, parents and others who will use the mosque sharing their input on the project: one designed without gender division and with consideration for a range of issues relevant to the community and area.\nInstead of searching for our children on the other side of an impenetrable wall, we can start creating the kinds of mosques where all are welcome and wish to return.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Religion, Architecture, Islam, Ottoman Empire, Mosques","role":"assistant"}]}

Even if governments approve the revised regulations, our best chance of preventing history repeating itself lies in a pandemic agreement. \n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal responses to health hazards that cross borders date back to an international sanitary conference in 1851 which focused on measures to limit the spread of cholera. Since then, several initiatives have aimed to improve global health security, including the formation of the WHO itself in 1946.\nThe International Health Regulations of 2005 were a major step in this evolution. They ushered in the modern era of risk assessment and created a global surveillance system for public health emergencies of international concern. \nNonetheless, it was soon evident the new tools were limited in dealing with the increasingly complex and fast moving threat of zoonotic diseases (when an animal pathogen \u201cspills over\u201d to infect people).\nKey changes to the International Health Regulations\nEarlier this month, the 194 members of the WHO World Health Assembly passed by consensus several important amendments to the International Health Regulations, including:\n\nadding a definition of a \u201cpandemic emergency\u201d to emphasise the importance of such events within the broader category of public health emergencies of international concern \nincreasing the focus on prevention with specific mention of \u201cpreparedness\u201d\nstrengthening equitable access to medical products and finance, with specific mention of \u201cequity and solidarity\u201d, and a dedicated \u201ccoordinating financial mechanism\u201d\nrequiring each state to establish a \u201cnational authority\u201d to improve the implementation of the international health regulations within and among countries\nrequiring countries to build a core capacity for \u201crisk communication including addressing misinformation and disinformation\u201d\nand modifying the \u201cdecision instrument\u201d to enhance the detection of emerging respiratory infections with high pandemic potential.\n\n\nThe proposals that didn\u2019t make it\nNot all proposed amendment were achieved. Some commentators had advocated to incorporate the experience of countries in the Asia-Pacific region that used an elimination strategy to delay the spread of COVID, giving time to roll out vaccines and other interventions.\nSuch measures protected both high-income islands (Aotearoa New Zealand, Australia, Singapore, Taiwan) as well as low and middle-income countries in continental Asia (Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia). \nThese nations generally achieved lower excess mortality than countries where the pandemic was less controlled. Similarly, the concept of elimination at source (sometimes called containment) wasn\u2019t included in this revision.\nA range of other potential improvements also failed to make it into the final text. These included an emphasis on preventing zoonotic spillovers from animals, enhanced sharing of scientific data and specimens, and strengthened accountability.\nNew Zealand now has 18 months to consider the proposed revisions. Along with other states, it may enter reservations to parts it disagrees with, even though this may weaken the coherence of the proposed amendments.\nWhy we need greater global cooperation\nA pandemic agreement could address the many needed reforms that go beyond the International Health Regulations.   \nBut the negotiations to reach global agreement are proving contentious. There have been deep divisions between rich and poorer countries over the sharing and affordable pricing of vaccines, treatments and diagnostics for developing states. The sharing of pathogen data has also proven problematic.\nThe negotiations have been further undermined by completely unfounded assertions that the WHO will be given power to impose restrictive measures such as lockdowns and vaccine mandates. \nDue to these challenges, the international community has not yet agreed on a text for a pandemic agreement. The WHO has announced the next steps for further negotiations, which are already years past their start date.\nFrom the threats of war to environmental devastation and pandemics, no country can unilaterally protect its citizens from the gravest shared threats to humanity. But while the need for global solidarity and cooperation is greater than ever, support for many of the key areas of international law is failing.\nWe owe it to the memory of the more than 27 million people estimated to have died so far from COVID, and the rising threats to future generations, to do the best we can to achieve a safer and more secure world.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"New Zealand, Zoonotic diseases, International Health Regulations, COVID-19, Health + Education","role":"assistant"}]}

In Australia, it\u2019s now only used for 16% of in-person transactions, down from about 70% in 2007. \nThe situation is so dire that on Monday, independent federal MP Andrew Gee introduced a private member\u2019s bill that would force businesses to accept cash or else face big fines. \n\nThe reality is that over the past decade, technological advancements have utterly transformed the way we pay for goods and services. \nPhones and smartwatches can now easily be used to pay by card, and buy-now-pay-later schemes and cryptocurrency payments offer further alternatives.\nThe shift away from cash only accelerated throughout the COVID pandemic, as health experts recommended avoiding using it for hygiene reasons. \nDespite these big changes in how we spend money, Australians have perhaps been more focused on how much amid a stubborn cost-of-living crisis. \nIn light of this, our research team wanted to investigate how our choice of payment method can interact with our actual spending habits. \nOur latest research offers a simple solution for anyone looking to save money \u2014 carry more cash!\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Money transporter Armaguard is in peril. Could cash be dead sooner than we think?\n\n\n\n\nWe pay less when we pay cash\nDrawing on both academic and industry sources, our research team combined the results from more than four decades of prior research on spending behaviour and payment methods into a large dataset. \nThis data spanned 71 research papers, 17 countries, and more than 11,000 participants. State-of-the-art meta-analysis techniques then allowed us to collectively analyse the results from all these prior studies, and re-examine their insights.\nWe found that cashless payments were indeed associated with higher levels of consumer spending compared to cash transactions, something that is referred to in the literature as the \u201ccashless effect\u201d.\nThis cashless effect was consistent across all other payment methods in the data set. \nPut simply, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you use a credit card, debit card or a buy-now-pay-later service \u2013 you are likely to spend more money using cashless methods than when you pay with cash.\nThe pain of paying\nUnder the traditional economic view that consumers behave rationally, there should be no differences in spending behaviour between different payment methods \u2013 money is money after all. \nBut the existence of the cashless effect shows that the payment methods we use do indeed influence our spending behaviour. \nThe leading theory to explain this effect attributes it to differences in the \u201cpain of paying\u201d, a concept first coined in 1996 that describes the emotions we feel when spending money. \nImportantly, our choice of payment method can influence the level of pain felt. \n\nWhen paying with cash, we have to physically count out notes and coins and hand them over. Humans seek to avoid losses, and paying by cash sees us physically lose a tangible object.\nConversely, nothing has to be handed over to pay cashlessly. We don\u2019t lose anything tangible with a swipe or a tap, so it feels less painful.\nPreliminary neurological evidence suggests that the \u201cpain of paying\u201d isn\u2019t just an abstract metaphor, and we may feel actual psychological pain with each transaction we make. \nResearch employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to observe brain activity in consumers has shown that paying activates brain regions related to experiencing psychological discomfort. \n\nPicture this: You\u2019re at a theme park, excited for a fun day. You use your smartwatch to pay for snacks, souvenirs and rides. It\u2019s all so convenient that you don\u2019t realise how much you\u2019re spending until you check your account later and see that you have completely blown your budget! \nThis is the cashless effect in action \u2212 if nothing is physically handed over, it\u2019s easy to lose track of how much is spent. \nA great tool for budgeting \u2013 while it lasts\nThe cost of living crisis has made spending control front-of-mind for many people. Our meta-analysis suggests that returning to \u201ccold hard cash\u201d whenever possible could be one valuable tool to help. \nThe increased friction felt when using cash could help people better control their money, even just by providing a moment to pause and consider whether a transaction is necessary. \nThis could help individuals make more mindful decisions, saving money while they can in an increasingly cashless world.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Cost of living, Cash, ATM, Payment, payments, cashless society, Payment systems, Cost of living crisis","role":"assistant"}]}

And that interest seems to be making the possibility of moving humanity to another planet, like Mars or the Moon, more distinct, with Nasa hoping to set up colonies in the next few decades. \nBut these missions will only be viable if astronauts can produce their own food. \nTo colonise Mars, settlers will have to grow their own food in systems that are as close to self-perpetuating as possible, with little or no input from Earth once these systems have been established. This is because Mars is 54.6 million km away from Earth, and it would take around seven months to get there using current technology.\nMartians will need to grow fresh produce to be healthy and well. Our research team looked at Mars because there are plans to send people there. While the atmosphere is toxic at 95% CO\u2082 (compared to 0.04% on Earth), Mars has a day length similar to that of Earth. As on Earth, intensive horticulture would need extended periods of lighting. And it\u2019s likely there is water in ice form on the surface of Mars and in the rocks below.\n\nWe set up an aquaponic system to test how to supply Martians with food in the future. Aquaponics is a food production system that pairs aquaculture (raising aquatic animals such as fish in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water). The nutrient-rich water from the aquaculture tanks are passed to the hydroponic parts of the system, to fertilise and grow the plants.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy team\u2019s research explored how to produce fish and vegetables and whether we could add effluents (liquid waste) from the aquaponics to simulate Martian regoliths. Regoliths are blankets of weathered rock, grit and sands that sit above the bedrock. \nAll regoliths are deficient in organic material. But Martian regoliths are made only of minerals. They are totally devoid of organic material and thus lacking the nutrients plants need and the microbes to help deliver water to the plants via their roots.\nOur study found nutrients from the fish water can not only be used to grow plants in the hydroponic parts of the aquaponic system but also potentially in the Martian\nregoliths, when treated with effluents taken from the aquaponic systems. Once\nproduction is established, nutrients from the fish and vegetable waste can also be used as compost to turn Martian regoliths into soil. \nWe successfully grew potatoes, tomatoes, dwarf beans, carrots, lettuce, spring onions, chives and basil in plant pots containing simulated Martian regoliths, where nutrients were added with the fish water. \nThe fish we used were tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) because they are easy to care for and grow relatively quickly, reaching maturity in five to seven months. The Aquaponics Group, at the School of Design at the University of Greenwich, is also researching alternative feeds including protein from algae and black soldier fly larvae, which may be possible to raise on Mars. \nIn our pilot study, the fish were provided with the right environment and feed for them to thrive, which can be replicated in indoor climate controlled growing tanks on Mars. The plants were grown in various sized plant pots in a large grow tent that simulated indoor Mars growing conditions in terms of light, temperature, humidity and air movement.\nCloser to home\nThis research is important not just for extra-terrestrial colonies but also for Earth which has its own hostile environments where there are regoliths in many arid and desert environments. These areas are especially suited for aquaponic systems as they save water and allow local people to grow nutritious food using the effluent water.\nAquaponics is one of the most sustainable methods of food production as it saves so much water. The produce can also be considered organic as you don\u2019t need additional fertilisers and chemicals. In some taste tests people thought the produce was superior to traditionally grown plants. The plants also have a beneficial effect on fish health and wellbeing.\nThe research was undertaken in an exhibition gallery at the University of\nGreenwich. Many visitors wanted to know whether the vegetables tasted of fish, which they don\u2019t. The exhibition projected images, dust storms, a lit red atmosphere and a large display which featured a tactile Martian terrain. The project provided a pilot version establishing principles and data to assist in a future, larger, collaborative funding bid.\nWhile this project offers a solution for food production away from Earth, we should remember that Earth is a paradise and there is no comparison in terms of its abundance and variety of life-forms. Putting mankind on Mars is a way to ensure the survival of humans in case of disaster on Earth. \nBut, we need to first and foremost protect our landscapes, habitats and biodiversity, and ensure every person on this planet is cared for. Additionally, we need to ensure that we better protect space and the other planets from our trash. We do not want to transfer our propensities to pollute. We also need to have answers to some hard ethical questions about whether it is right to take other life-forms beyond Earth, where they have evolved over millions of years.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Space, Water, Mars, Fish, Food, Organic food, Organic, Sustainable diet, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

We may be aware of the science, but how do we imagine AI and our relationship to it both now and in the future? Fortunately, film may provide us with some insights.\nProbably the best-known AI in film is HAL 9000 from Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). HAL is an artificially intelligent computer housed on board a spacecraft capable of interstellar travel. The film was released less than a year before humans landed on the moon. And yet, even in this optimism about a new era of space travel, HAL\u2019s portrayal sounded a note of caution about artificial intelligence. His motivations are ambiguous, and he shows himself capable of turning against his human crew.\nThis 1960s classic demonstrates fears that are common throughout AI film history \u2013 that AIs cannot be trusted, that they will rebel against their human creators, and  seek to overpower or overthrow us. \nThese fears are contextualised in different ways during different historical eras \u2013 in the 1950s they are associated with the cold war followed by the space race in the 1960s and 1970s. Then in the 1980s it was videogaming, and in the 1990s the internet. Despite these differing preoccupations, fear of AI remains remarkably consistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy latest research, which forms the backbone of my new book AI in the Movies, explores how \u201cstrong\u201d or \u201chuman-level\u201d AI is depicted in film. I examined more than 50 films to see how they shed light on human attitudes to AI \u2013 how we interpret it and understand it through characters and stories, and how attitudes have changed since AI\u2019s beginnings.\n\nTypes of AIs\nThe idea of AI was born in 1956 at an American summer research project workshop at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where a group of academics gathered to brainstorm ideas around \u201cthinking machines\u201d.\nA mathematician called John McCarthy coined the name \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d and just as soon as the new scientific field had a name, filmmakers were already imagining a human-like AI and what our relationship with it might be. In the same year an AI, Robby the Robot, appeared in the film Forbidden Planet, and returned the following year in 1957 in the film The Invisible Boy to defeat another type of AI, this time an evil supercomputer.\nThe AI as malevolent computer appeared again in 1965 as Alpha 60, in the chilling dystopia of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s Alphaville, and then in 1968 with Kubrick\u2019s memorable HAL in 2001: A Space Odyssey. \n\nThese early AI films set the template for what was to follow. There were AIs that had robot bodies and later robot bodies that looked human \u2013 the first of these appearing in Westworld in 1973, where a robot malfunction at a futuristic amusement park for adults creates chaos and terror. Then there were AIs that were digital like the evil Joshua in the 1977 horror Demon Seed, where a woman is impregnated by a supercomputer.\nIn the 1980s, digital AIs started to become connected to network computing \u2013 where computers \u201ctalked\u201d to one another in an early incarnation of what would become the internet \u2013 like the one stumbled upon by Matthew Broderick\u2019s high-school student in War Games (1983), who almost accidentally starts a nuclear conflict. \nFrom the 1990s, an AI could move between digital and material realms. In Japanese animation Ghost in the Shell (1995), the Puppet Master exists in the ebb and flow of the internet, but can inhabit \u201cshell\u201d bodies. Agent Smith in The Matrix Revolutions (2003), takes over a human body and materialises in the real world. In Her (2013), the AI operating system Samantha eventually moves beyond matter, beyond the \u201cstuff\u201d of human existence, becoming a post-material being. \n\nMirrors, doubles and hybrids\nIn the first few decades of AI film, AI characters mirrored the human characters. In Collosus: The Forbin Project (1970), the AI supercomputer reflects and amplifies the inventor\u2019s own arrogant overreaching ambition. In Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991), Sarah Connor has become like the AI Skynet\u2019s Terminators herself: her strength is her armour and she hunts to kill.\nBy the 2000s, human-AI doubles began to overlap and merge into each other. In Spielberg\u2019s AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001), the AI \u201cson\u201d David looks just like a real boy, whereas the real son Martin comes home from hospital connected to tubes and wires that make him look like a cyborg.\nIn Ex Machina (2014), the human Caleb tests the AI robot Ava, but ends up questioning his own humanness, examining his eyeball for digital traces and cutting his skin to ensure that he bleeds.\nIn the past 25 years of AI film, the borders between human and AI, digital and material have become porous, emphasising the fluid and hybrid nature of AI creations. And in the films In The Machine (2013), Transcendence (2014) and Chappie (2015), the boundary between human and AI is eroded almost to the point of non-existence. These films present scenarios of transhumanism \u2013 in which humans can evolve beyond their current physical and mental constraints by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence to upload the human mind.\n\nAlthough these stories are imaginary and their characters fictional, they vividly depict our fascinations and fears. We are afraid of artificial intelligence and that fear never goes away in film, although it has been questioned more in recent decades, and more positive portrayals can be observed, such as the little trash-collecting robot in WALL-E. But mostly we are afraid that they will become too powerful, and will seek to become our masters. Or we fear they may hiding among us, and that we might not recognise them.\nBut at times, too, we feel sympathy towards them: AI characters in films can be pitiful figures who wish to be accepted by humans but never will be. We are also jealous of them \u2013 of their intellectual capacity, their physical robustness and the fact that they do not experience human death.\nSurrounding this fear and envy is a fascination with AIs that is present throughout film history \u2013 we see ourselves in AI creations and project our emotions onto them. At times enemies of humans, at times uncanny mirrors, and sometimes even human-AI hybrids, the past 70 years of films about AI demonstrate the inextricably intertwined nature of human-AI relationships.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), Internet, Supercomputers, Science fiction, Cold War, Video games, Robots, Space race, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nIn February 2024, I attended the annual conference of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society \u2013 the peak group for scientists working in all branches of weather and climate research. Over the past decade, the mood of our gatherings has become increasingly sombre. Some presenters have taken to apologising in advance for their confronting results, with some attempting to soften the blow by including funny animated gifs or photos of soothing sunsets to comfort the audience. \nIt\u2019s not hard to understand why. This year we had a plenary address by a distinguished IPCC veteran. The speaker began by saying that the world has \u201cBuckley\u2019s chance\u201d of achieving the 1.5\u00b0C target, and even 2\u00b0C is going to be a stretch. If emissions continue at the current rate, the 1.5\u00b0C threshold could be breached as soon as 2028. \nForget the critical decade, what happens every single month during the next handful of years is crucial in determining how quickly we drain the remaining carbon budget needed to achieve the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. \nPeople who have been working in the field for decades are no longer sugarcoating the bad news \u2013 they want us to feel an appropriate level of alarm and outrage so we can get on with the job of doing something about the terrible situation we find ourselves in. We need you to stare into the abyss with us and not turn away.\nEven a cursory look at the latest figures released by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) shows that the situation we are facing is extremely serious. The 2023 Emissions Gap Report \u2013 subtitled \u201cBroken Record: Temperatures hit new highs, yet world fails to cut emissions (again)\u201d \u2013 explains that, even in the most optimistic scenario, the chance of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C is just 14%, with various scenarios indicating a 90% probability of warming between 2\u00b0C and 3\u00b0C by the end of the century. \nIf currently implemented policies are continued with no increase in ambition, there is a 90% chance that the Earth will warm between 2.3\u00b0C and 4.5\u00b0C, with a best estimate of 3.5\u00b0C. \nDespite all the political rhetoric you might have heard in the news, the scientific reality is that the planet is still on track for catastrophic levels of warming. Even if nations make good on their net zero promises \u2013 which is a big \u201cif\u201d because right now many nations\u2019 pledges have no finance, weak implementation or limited political ambition, so are effectively empty promises \u2013 there is a 90% chance that we are still on track for 2.4\u00b0C of global warming under this best-case scenario, which will lock in centuries of irreversible changes to the climate system.\nI know these numbers are hard for most people to absorb, so perhaps the best way to grasp the reality of climate change in Australia is to consider\nthe impacts we\u2019ve already witnessed so far with 1.2\u00b0C of global warming.\n\nAustralia\u2019s vulnerability to climate change\nAs the driest inhabited continent on the planet, Australia is particularly\nvulnerable to climate change. Our nation is a huge island surrounded by\nthe Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans, resulting in dramatic swings in\nour weather. You can think of Australia\u2019s background climate as essentially a tug of war between warm tropical influences from the north and cool temperate systems from the south. \nThe weather experienced from season to season is driven by differences between the rate of warming of the hot land and surrounding cool ocean. These contrasting temperature and air pressure gradients set the scene for the complex interaction of atmospheric and ocean cycles that drive Australia\u2019s highly variable climate. \nThese factors make weather and climate forecasting very difficult in our part of the world \u2013 there are a lot of complicated dynamic processes that are hard to represent with the mathematical equations used to drive climate models. It\u2019s a bit like trying to reduce the functioning of each part of the human body down to lines of computer code. It\u2019s very, very difficult \u2013 if not impossible \u2013 to capture the full complexity of behaviour. \nThis is especially true in a rapidly warming climate which is now altering historical weather patterns, making them more erratic and harder to predict. Nonetheless, there is still a huge amount we can say about the operation of the Earth\u2019s climate, with advances in computing technology and our fundamental understanding of the science rapidly improving our models\nwith every passing year.\nTo add to the complexity, the landmass of Australia stretches from the\ntropics in places like Far North Queensland to the temperate mid-latitudes\nof Tasmania, generating an enormous range of climate zones that sustain\nrainforests, coral reefs, deserts and alpine environments. This is why we can have tropical cyclone conditions, extreme heatwaves and bushfires happening at the same time across the country, challenging emergency services.\n\nAustralia is also the flattest continent on Earth, meaning that weather systems can travel vast distances without being tripped up by rugged terrain, unleashing destruction over large areas. The mountain chain that moderates the weather and climate of Australia\u2019s east coast is the Great Dividing Range, a feature that stretches 3,500 kilometres from the northern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the east coast before disappearing into the central plains of western Victoria. \nWhen weather systems collide with mountains, there can be rapid uplift of air masses, leading to atmospheric instability that can result in severe thunderstorms and torrential downpours that trigger flash flooding and destructive winds. But essentially, away from the eastern seaboard, Australia is mostly a flat, dry desert with wet coastal fringes that house our capital cities. Today, close to 90% of Australia\u2019s population lives within 50 kilometres of the coast, and that number is increasing, leaving us particularly exposed to the threat of sea level rise.\nWhen thinking about the effects of a warming planet, it is important to\nunderstand that the world does not heat up uniformly. Because of the presence of oceans, mountains, glaciers and forests, different areas of the Earth warm at different rates. The geographical characteristics of Australia mean that the continent is warming faster than the global average \u2013 temperatures have risen by 1.5\u00b0C since 1910, compared with the 1.2\u00b0C global increase since pre-industrial times. \nGiven that around three-quarters of Australia is already classified as arid or semi-arid \u2013 with half of the country receiving less than 300 millimetres of rainfall each year \u2013 further warming threatens to make life on an already very dry continent even harder. We are very vulnerable to intense swings in rainfall that cause droughts and floods, relentless heat, and the risk of permanent inundation of low-lying areas from rising seas.\nAs global warming continues, Australia\u2019s climate is fast becoming more\nextreme and unpredictable, edging us closer towards breaching thresholds\nthat will make it very difficult, if not impossible, to adapt to. This is especially the case when there are simultaneous disasters unfolding in different regions, or a rapid succession of back-to-back disasters that undermine the ability of communities to recover. If there is not enough time between destructive events, the damage begins to compound. We see the continued degradation of our natural environment and the weakening of social resilience that will eventually lead to the permanent displacement of people from their homes and ongoing impacts on our economy.\nWe don\u2019t need to use our imagination to picture what this scenario looks\nlike. The Black Summer bushfires of 2019\u201320 and the 2022 east coast floods\nhighlighted Australia\u2019s lack of preparedness. Our emergency services were\nalarmingly under-resourced and stretched thin across vast areas, which left\nmany local communities to fend for themselves. \nDuring the catastrophic flooding of the town of Lismore, in northern New South Wales, in 2022, we witnessed extraordinary scenes of locals rescuing each other from rooftops in their boats, jet skis and kayaks when the handful of State Emergency Service crews were overwhelmed by the needs of 45,000 residents. People in rural areas set off in their boats with cordless angle grinders to cut people out of the roof cavities of their homes where they\u2019d been forced to retreat. The situation was so bad that the army had to be called in, but it did not show up until a full five days later, leaving the terrified community feeling abandoned.\nOver two years on, people from Lismore are still displaced from their\nhomes and uncertain about how to move forward. Do they plan to relocate the town and pray that another once-in-a-century flood won\u2019t happen again, or is the writing already on the wall and it is time simply to abandon ship? \n\nClimate tipping points\nDespite our inherent vulnerabilities, Australia still does not have a national climate change adaptation plan, as other parts of the world do. Although the government is in the process of developing a national strategy \u2013 essentially, we have a plan to make a plan \u2013 the pace of progress has been disastrously slow, given the urgency of the crisis we face. \nWhile all states and territories have adaptation plans of some kind, the lack of national leadership has meant that regions have had to go it alone without adequate operational resources. Without national coordination and funding, these plans are little more than words on a page.\nHow many disasters does it take to wake people up to the fact that Australia\u2019s climate is becoming more extreme, with today\u2019s destruction set to be dwarfed by things to come? Do people realise that adapting to climate change won\u2019t be possible in some parts of the country? Exactly how much do we need to lose before our political leaders decide to take this seriously?\nThe scientific reality of a rapidly warming world is very confronting,\nespecially in Australia. As the years since our Black Summer have shown\nus, the prospect of a future of dealing with back-to-back disasters across\nthe country every year is ultimately going to be impossible for our\necosystems and communities to adapt to. \nThe conditions experienced in 2023 have many experts worried that we may have breached regional and global tipping points that will unleash a cascade of changes that will be with us for thousands of years. The problem is that we will only know if we have definitively crossed critical thresholds for planetary stability in hindsight, so we have to move forward armed with the best available science while we still can to minimise the damage.\nThe latest research shows that several tipping points, such as the disintegration of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, may be triggered within the Paris Agreement range of 1.5\u00b0C to 2\u00b0C of global warming. This means it is possible that the Earth will experience major transformations even if we manage to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. \nIn a 2024 report released by the CSIRO on the risks of tipping points to Australia, the authors warn: \n\nThe effects of tipping points on the global climate are generally not currently accounted for in projections based on climate models. This means that effects of tipping points are also not included in national climate projections and impact assessments for Australia and may represent significant risks on top of the changes that are generally included. \n\nThe report suggests the need to plan for \u201clow likelihood high impact\u201d scenarios that include climate tipping points. For example, the construction of new critical infrastructure should incorporate global sea-level rise scenarios of around two metres by 2100. Given that we are a highly coastal nation, the adaption challenge of planned relocation and retreat will be enormous.\nWhile it may be possible to protect vulnerable areas with sea walls or the restoration of natural dunes for a while, these are only band-aid solutions that will not stem the rising tide for long. Hard decisions will need to be made by local councils around the country about how and when they plan to withdraw residents from high-risk areas. As the Australian Academy of Science notes: \u201cUnder high levels of warming and sea level rise, retreat is likely to be the only feasible long-term strategy.\u201d\nScientists know the situation is very bad, but we also know exactly what we need to do to stabilise the Earth\u2019s temperature and avoid triggering a domino effect of impacts in other components of the climate system. If we don\u2019t put the brakes on industrial emissions immediately, children alive today will inherit this nightmarish future. \nIt makes me wonder if people in decades to come will look back at the world\u2019s collective failure to shut down the fossil fuel industry in time and see it for what it really is: an intergenerational crime against humanity.\n\nThis is an edited extract from Highway to Hell: Climate Change and Australia\u2019s Future (Black Inc.)\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Environment, Climate science, Book extract","role":"assistant"}]}

These \u201cforever chemicals\u201d are in thousands of products, from clothing and cosmetics to cleaning products, and are linked to cancers, liver damage, high cholesterol and asthma. \nDr. Jessica Ray, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington, explains what PFAS are, how scientists are trying to remove them from the environment, and what you can do to reduce the impact of PFAS on your own health.\n\nThe Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion, which have been edited for brevity and clarity.\nWhat are PFAS, and how are they used?\n\n\n\n\n\nJessica Ray: PFAS are a class of thousands of synthetic chemicals originally manufactured and heavily used in the 1950s. They were the active ingredient in fire suppressant foams that were used at military bases on aircraft fires.\nSince then, they\u2019ve been used in many applications and consumer products \u2013 shampoos, dental floss, nail polish. They\u2019ve been used in waxy coatings found in food containers. They have also been applied as nonstick coatings; for example, in cookware. They\u2019ve been used in outerwear to help with rain protection.\nWhy are PFAS called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d?\nJessica Ray: It is difficult for PFAS to degrade naturally in the environment or even during processes like water treatment. \nHow do PFAS move through the environment?\nJessica Ray: Unfortunately, PFAS like to stick to solid surfaces like soils. They can dissolve in water and enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. And because PFAS can permeate air, water and soil, humans and animals can be exposed to them in a multitude of ways.\nFor example, if PFAS are present in ocean water, and then the fish ingest and become contaminated with PFAS, and then we consume those fish, then we are exposed to PFAS. And unfortunately, researchers have detected PFAS in many, many different drinking water sources worldwide. Not just surface water and groundwater, but bottled water as well.\nWhat are the health impacts of PFAS?\nJessica Ray: PFAS have been linked to liver tissue damage and kidney cancer. If a fetus is exposed to PFAS during pregnancy, that can lead to low birth weight and accelerated puberty. PFAS have also been linked to impairments of the immune system.\nHow can we reduce personal exposure to PFAS?\nJessica Ray: You can do a number of things. If you\u2019re cooking, you could purchase and use stainless steel or cast iron cookware, very tried and true cookware that should not contain PFAS. \nAlso look for products that explicitly state they are PFAS-free. And you could buy organic products, those should have lower PFAS loads. Finding ways to reduce PFAS loads to the environment and to drinking water will be important given the Environmental Protection Agency ruling in April 2024 to regulate several PFAS in drinking water. \n\nHow can we remove PFAS from our drinking water?\nJessica Ray: A handful of companies are selling essentially a version of a Brita water filter that are targeted for PFAS. Generally though, just using something like a Brita or Pur water filter at home should help reduce exposure to not only PFAS, but other contaminants that might persist even in drinking water that\u2019s distributed to your tap at home. \nWhat about your research on removing PFAS from water?\nJessica Ray: My research group is exploring two different approaches for treating PFAS in water. One approach is to remove or separate PFAS from water. The other is to destroy PFAS in water. \nFor the separation approaches, we\u2019re looking at existing water treatment processes used in drinking water and wastewater treatment, and then trying to modify those processes to selectively target PFAS in water apart from other contaminants that might be in the water. \nHow is your group trying to improve PFAS filtration?\nJessica Ray: If you are filtering your water at home using a filtration cartridge, then that can help to remove a wide variety of contaminants. These contaminants can include heavy metals or other dissolved contaminants in water. \nBut often, PFAS in drinking water sources tend to exist in very, very low concentrations, while other contaminants exist at much higher ones. Filters only have so many adsorption sites available where contaminants are bound. And so there is a strong likelihood the adsorption sites will be occupied before the PFAS can be removed from the water. \nOne approach that we\u2019ve been using is to develop new adsorbents that help target PFAS. My group has been developing this material for the last couple of years. And we\u2019ve been talking to people who can help commercialize this technology so consumers can apply these kinds of point-of-use treatments to help protect them from PFAS. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how long it will be until the treatments will be commercially available \u2013 maybe in one or two years. \nAre there alternatives to PFAS that are safer to use?\nJessica Ray: Researchers are looking into what\u2019s called green chemistry \u2013 designing chemicals that behave similarly to PFAS but aren\u2019t as toxic and will break down in the environment. So there is hope for the future.\nWatch the full interview to hear more.\nSciLine is a free service based at the nonprofit American Association for the Advancement of Science that helps journalists include scientific evidence and experts in their news stories.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"PFAS, Forever chemicals, Toxic chemicals","role":"assistant"}]}

It\u2019s a staggering figure. \nThere are many reasons for this, including poverty, reliability of service, access to linguistically and culturally relevant content, leisure time, access to equipment and training. But perhaps the most debilitating barrier is access to network infrastructure. \nOne way communities are overcoming network access barriers is by creating networks themselves. A digital network built and operated by the people who use it is a collective response to what is often a systemic problem. Communities are building and operating their own broadband networks all over the world.\n\nDeveloping network literacy\nOne of the key challenges that arises when people want to build their own broadband network is ensuring community members have the knowledge and skills required to address the complexities involved. Many different kinds of information have to be assembled and strategically navigated. \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the problem we set out to solve with the Community Network Roadmap. \nWe came together as a small team of engineers, social scientists and designers to create a document that helps non-experts design, create and sustain a community-run broadband network. The elements of a network need to not only be built and installed, but also maintained, repaired and replaced over time. These elements include both technical and social infrastructure such as key personnel and community relationships.\nBuilding and maintenance\nThe Roadmap is based on research evaluating success strategies of community networks in Argentina and Mexico. Members of the team also had experience building networks in North America and working with community network builders from around the world. In the Roadmap, we wanted to emphasize two strategic priorities: building and maintaining. \nBuilding encompasses the urgency and complexity of getting a network off the ground, while maintaining considers planning for long-term network sustainability.\nWe designed the Roadmap using visual strategies for clarity \u2014 for example, we strategically differentiated the layout with colour coding, using yellow for \u201cBuild\u201d and purple for \u201cMaintain.\u201d This design approach improves understanding and also anticipates future challenges related to both the inception and maintenance phases of the community network\u2019s lifecycle.\n\nInclusive information design\nInformation design can organize complex information in more accessible and inclusive ways. We organized the content structurally and visually to provide a clear, accessible, easy-to-navigate and usable document for as broad an audience as possible. \nThe Roadmap emphasizes community efforts aimed at inclusion, accountability, group decision-making and long-term planning. And it also presents the technical steps and stages required for building a network in an accessible way \u2014 including local needs assessments, network mapping, equipment choices and deploying a pilot network.\nThe publication structure, guided by principles of information design, breaks up complex blocks of information into manageable chunks using accessible design features such as cross-referencing and signposting strategies. The Roadmap is a quick and ready resource for learning and training. \nHarnessing community knowledge\nAnother key strategy identified in the Roadmap is how to pool technical knowledge among community members tackling a network project. The Roadmap lays out strategies for documenting and sharing troubleshooting and problem-solving resources, so that emerging community network wisdom does not get lost.\nCommunity networks in different contexts will present unique opportunities and challenges. In creating this tool we drew on research and experience collaborating with community networks in rural Mexico and Argentina, the Philippines, and  First Nations and Indigenous groups in Canada and the United States.\nOur hope is that the Roadmap will provide both short and long-term considerations that a wide range of communities will find helpful in their own efforts to overcome connectivity barriers.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Broadband is the key infrastructure for the 21st century\n\n\n\n\nPlanning and maintaining networks\nThe Community Network Roadmap is designed for communities in both the early stages of considering a community network, as well as for those who already have a network and require resources for troubleshooting and maintenance.\nFor communities in early stages of thinking about a community network, the Roadmap offers thorough and research-based explanations of the many different issues, dimensions and considerations that can arise in the process of building and sustaining a community-run broadband network. For example, community relationships and accountable decision-making processes are as important to consider as network maps and equipment choices.\nIn addition, communities starting a network often overlook longer-term issues like succession planning, network expansion, equipment upgrades and changing local needs. Bringing in medium and long-term considerations at the outset can make growth and change easier to manage. \nThe Roadmap can also be used as a resource for troubleshooting specific problems. \nA global community resource\nThe Roadmap is designed with a DIY method in mind \u2014 it is a document that we hope will help communities achieve connectivity goals using resources they have available. Feedback from communities will help us update and adapt it to better reflect the needs of those who use it.\nConnectivity today plays a central role in allowing individuals and communities to fully realize citizenship and belonging. How we navigate everyday life and participate politically and socially, and how we access educational opportunities all now manifest, at least in part, through digital networks. \nTo be excluded from digital communication is often paramount to be being excluded from society. When communities are able to build and maintain broadband networks in accessible and reliable ways, they are afforded all of the opportunities and advantages of digital communication. \nShraddha Kumbhar contributed to the writing of this article; she was the lead information designer for the Roadmap and is a graduate from Emily Carr University\u2019s Master of Design program.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Internet, Internet access, digital design, Inclusive design","role":"assistant"}]}

The Conversation asked Susan Shaw, a gender and sexuality studies scholar who studies Southern Baptist women, to explain the votes and other developments in the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination.\nThe Southern Baptist Convention rejected a proposal that would explicitly state that only men could be pastors. Does that mean that the SBC is changing and becoming more accepting of women in leadership roles?\nAbsolutely not. The day before the vote on the denomination\u2019s proposed constitutional amendment to exclude churches with women serving in pastoral roles, the convention expelled the First Baptist Church of Alexandria, Virginia, for its views that women can serve as pastors. That vote wasn\u2019t even close at 6,759 to 563. \nHow many female pastors are in the SBC at the moment? Could you also explain some of the history of the opposition to women serving in leadership? \n\n\n\n\n\nThere are somewhere between 1,000 to 1,800 women serving with the title of pastor in Southern Baptist churches. Few, if any of these women, are senior pastors. Instead, they are associate pastors, youth or children\u2019s pastors, women\u2019s pastors or other kinds of pastors, all working under the supervision of a man who is senior pastor.\nThe SBC passed a resolution in 1984 rejecting women as senior pastors.\nWhile resolutions are not binding on local churches, the proposed constitutional amendment would have defined a church as in cooperation with the SBC only if it \u201c[a]ffirms, appoints, or employs only men as any kind of pastor or elder as qualified by Scripture.\u201d\nIn order to amend its constitution, the convention must first approve any proposed amendment at an annual meeting and then confirm it with a final vote at the following annual meeting. That vote requires a two-thirds supermajority approval for the amendment to become part of the constitution. The amendment on women pastors passed in 2023 but failed this year because it received only 61% of the vote. \nSome of those who opposed the amendment argued the convention has already spoken on the issue, has mechanisms to address churches with women pastors, and therefore does not need to amend its constitution. Nothing in this argument suggests support for women, and, in fact, those opposing the amendment often affirmed their support for the denomination\u2019s stance against women pastors.\n\nFor many Southern Baptists, the exclusion of women from being senior pastors does not prevent their participation in other pastoral roles that do not have the supervisory authority of the senior pastor or require ordination. That certainly was the language of the promoters of the 1984 resolution, and the move to expel churches that have women in pastoral roles other than senior pastor, as they recently did in Alexandria, Virginia, reaches beyond the intent of the earlier resolution. \nSouthern Baptists also highly value what they call \u201cthe autonomy of the local church.\u201d This deeply held Baptist belief means that each local church is self-governing and is not in any way controlled by the SBC. By expanding its exclusion of women from pastoral roles, the SBC may have been perceived as infringing on the autonomy of the local church.\nIn 2023, the Southern Baptist Convention refused to welcome Saddleback Church back into its fold after its ouster earlier in the year for having women pastors. What do you think this vote will change? \nI don\u2019t think the vote will change anything. While Saddleback\u2019s women pastors were not senior pastors, they were ordained, and the church did affirm women\u2019s ability to hold any pastoral role. We can see from this year\u2019s expulsion of First Baptist Alexandria that the SBC will continue to purge churches that affirm women in all pastoral roles. \nThe only thing this year\u2019s vote showed us is that a significant minority of messengers \u2013 Southern Baptists\u2019 term for delegates to the SBC annual meeting \u2013 do not want to meddle with the convention\u2019s constitution.\nAt the same time, the SBC voted to oppose the use of in vitro fertilization. Could you explain this vote and SBC\u2019s historical views on fetal personhood?\nThis resolution extends Southern Baptists\u2019 rejection of any procedure that terminates fetuses or embryos. The resolution sympathizes with infertile couples but argues that because embryos are often stockpiled and destroyed following a successful implantation that the process is ultimately the \u201cdestruction of embryonic human life.\u201d\nIn the 1970s, before the fundamentalist takeover of the SBC in the 1980s and early 1990s, Southern Baptists generally opposed abortion on demand, but they also worried about government interference in women\u2019s decision-making about their own bodies. \nIn the 1980s, the convention made a hard right turn with the goal of having abortion outlawed again. The SBC\u2019s language changed from \u201cfetal life\u201d to \u201cpre-born\u201d or \u201cunborn\u201d persons. Now we see the SBC talking about embryos as full human beings and advocating \u201cfor the government to restrain actions inconsistent with the dignity and value of every human being, which necessarily includes frozen embryonic human beings.\u201d\nWhat else was significant about the meeting?\nDespite pressure in recent years for the SBC to do something about its sexual abuse problem, the convention has repeatedly failed to make significant progress, especially on its long-awaited database to track offenders. This year, again, messengers voted to pass various abuse reforms, but survivors found themselves disappointed with how little change is really happening. Significant change, it seems, always fails due to concerns about insurance and liability.\nTaken  together, the  vote against the constitutional amendment, the resolution opposing in vitro fertilization, and the lack of action on sexual abuse reform underline that nothing in the denomination\u2019s ultraconservative beliefs about women is changing.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Abortion, IVF, Evangelicals, Protestants, Southern Baptist Convention, Religion and society","role":"assistant"}]}

However, these same reports also caution that SRM technologies could themselves change the climate in ways that would generate severe adverse impacts.\nThere is no global consensus around SRM as a climate change response strategy. \nAt the recent Sixth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA), attended by one of the authors, Jennifer Garard, world governments were unable to come to an agreement on whether to call for a scientific assessment of the potential and risks of SRM deployment and the resolution was withdrawn.\nAs climate scientists, we argue that a robust and democratic scientific assessment process, enriched by the inclusion of the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, would be an important step forward to help the global decision-making community build consensus around this critical and controversial topic. \nThe risks\nDeploying SRM technologies, or even testing these technologies in real-world settings, would carry risks. Many of these risks remain poorly understood. \nSRM actions could have severe negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity, air quality and the ozone layer and agricultural productivity. These impacts are likely to be felt unequally across the Earth and could further exacerbate existing challenges related to environmental justice and equity.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Climate engineering carries serious national security risks \u2212 countries facing extreme heat may try it anyway, and the world needs to be prepared\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, deploying SRM technologies in the absence of rapid emissions cuts would produce a dangerous dependence on sustained SRM action to maintain its climate effect. In this scenario, if SRM were stopped suddenly, the so-called termination effect would cause rapid warming with the potential for substantial harm to multiple life-sustaining systems around the world. \nThese questions raise additional concerns of intergenerational injustice, in which future generations may have no choice but to continue with SRM deployment to avoid the consequences of terminating it.\nSurface level\nBy definition, SRM does not address the accumulation of greenhouse gases which are the root cause of climate change. Consequently, there is an additional risk of distracting attention and resources away from the need for rapid and profound emissions cuts. \nOn top of its potential for distraction, SRM technologies cannot address the problem of ocean acidification and may also pose challenges to using solar energy to support decarbonization. \nThe costs of SRM deployment are also high with one estimate placing this value at US$2.25 billion per year over the first 15 years of deployment \u2014 funds which likely would be much better spent on emissions reductions efforts.\n\nSimply put, despite several decades of research and discussion, there remains no comprehensive scientific assessment of SRM risks and uncertainties. Such an assessment is critically needed to underpin multilateral discussions and inform governance frameworks.\nSRM technology is likewise a highly controversial topic in global environmental negotiations. A resolution was put forward by Switzerland at the most recent UN Environment Assembly to mandate the UN Environment Programme to convene a scientific expert group to assess SRM.\nOpposition was strong from various quarters. Leaders from many African nations joined forces to advocate for a strict non-use agreement rather than a scientific assessment. Meanwhile, the Joint Global Statement from Major Groups and Stakeholders stated bluntly that: \n\n\u201cSRM is basically fighting multidecadal, global-scale pollution with multidecadal, global-scale pollution.\u201d \n\nOther countries were opposed to the resolution but wished to keep the question of exploring the use of SRM open. Ultimately, no decision was reached.\nWhat role for scientific assessments?\nGiven the significant risks involved, the issue of SRM governance urgently requires international attention and oversight. However, world governments at UNEA were unable to reach consensus on even assessing SRM, let alone on whether a non-use agreement could be implemented.\nMost world government representatives at UNEA agreed on the need to avoid the serious risks of unilateral deployment of SRM technologies. However, we feel that the opposition to a scientific assessment of SRM may inadvertently enable individual countries or organizations to proceed with risky experiments.\nGiven the divergent global views on this topic, a non-use agreement appears unlikely in the short term. However, a transparent and inclusive assessment process could actually be an important step towards such an eventual agreement.\n\nThe International Panel on Climate Change is an important player in any assessment process given its strong history of rigorous scientific work on climate change. Likewise, the UN Environment Programme could also play a pivotal role and help bring in diverse stakeholders.\nMandating a trusted intergovernmental organization such as the United Nations to lead a rigorous and transparent assessment process that is inclusive of multiple perspectives would be a critical step towards SRM governance, including a potential non-use agreement.\nGovernance of SRM is of the utmost importance, precisely because of the high level of controversy surrounding this suite of technologies. A non-use agreement is one potential governance strategy, though international discussions currently seem a long way from being able to agree on such an outcome. The only way to break this deadlock is to carry out a transparent and inclusive scientific assessment process.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Global warming, UNFCCC, solar radiation, IPCC reports, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)","role":"assistant"}]}

But the Kremlin said the agreement would mean each country would come to the aid of the other if attacked. At the top of the agenda for the meeting was almost certainly the war and Russian military requirements. \nSince the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 Moscow has been ostracised by the west and its economy has been hit by a succession of harsh sanctions packages. North Korea\u2019s leadership knows all about isolation and has faced decades of economic sanctions. Pyongyang is also increasingly seen as a threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region \u2013 and potentially the United States, particularly in light of the regime\u2019s longstanding pursuit of nuclear weapons capability. \nBut Putin is in Pyongyang looking for less sophisticated weapons than these. Despite both leaders denying they struck an arms deal when they met in 2023 in Vladivostok, North Korea has been accused of supplying Russia with the artillery and ammunition it so desperately needs to keep its war effort in Ukraine going. Putin and Kim denied at the time that they agreed an arms deal.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Kim has been a supporter of Russia\u2019s position over the Ukraine war, probably because closer ties with Russia offers the best solution to a range of problems North Korea faces. The North Korean leader has been eager to boost the prestige and security of his country since his overtures to then US president Donald Trump broke down in 2019, and this deal with Putin offers that platform.\nSubsequently, the Biden administration has strengthened military ties with Seoul and South Korea and has adopted a tougher stance towards the North. At the same time, North Korea needs energy supplies for its ailing economy  and food for its hungry people, so will be looking for economic support from Russia. \nNevertheless, this is neither the first nor the closest Russia-North Korea alliance. It is also not the first time weapons have been crucial to their relationship. The parallels to the alliance between Kim Il Sung \u2013 Kim Jong Un\u2019s grandfather and the person the younger Kim has styled himself upon \u2013 and Joseph Stalin \u2013 the former leader of the Soviet Union who Putin seeks to emulate \u2013 are extremely clear.\n\nHarks back to WWII\nIn the 1930s, Kim Il Sung was a relatively unknown Korean communist leading a small guerrilla band fighting the Japanese in Manchuria. During the second world war he fled to the Soviet Union and joined the Red Army, rising to the rank of major. \nAfter the Japanese surrendered in August 1945, they handed what had been occupied Korea to the allies. It was split into two zones, one overseen by the Soviets, the other in the south overseen by the US. \nKim Il Sung was handpicked by Stalin to lead the Korean Workers party and then to lead North Korea when it was formally established in 1948. Kim\u2019s loyalties to the Soviet Union were clear and he was determined to create a Stalinist state.\nHe was principally a Korean nationalist and was determined to unite the Korean peninsula under his rule. But he could not launch an invasion into South Korea without Stalin\u2019s permission and, crucially, Soviet weaponry. \nKim Il Sung made numerous requests to Stalin for this support. Yet, Stalin remained cautious in the early cold war, fearing the United States would retaliate if its South Korean ally was attacked.\nThe situation then rapidly changed. In October 1949 the Chinese Communist party defeated its Nationalist rivals for power and the People\u2019s Republic of China was born. Also, in January 1950 the United States suggested it would not come to the defence of South Korea if attacked. \nAfter this, Stalin became more amenable to Kim\u2019s pleas, believing the North Korean leader\u2019s claims that victory would be swift. He then wrote to Kim Il Sung giving him the green light and supplying him with the weapons he desired. Much of this military hardware was old second world war stock but it included 200 T-34 tanks that had proven highly effective against Nazi Germany.\nWith this decision, the Soviet-North Korean alliance was cemented. However, it immediately led to the gravest crisis of the early cold war. The North Korean invasion on 25 June 1950 \u2013 almost exactly 74 years ago \u2013 did not lead to a quick victory, since Washington refused to abandon its ally and intervened along with 15 other countries under the United Nations\u2019 aegis. \nWhen North Korea appeared defeated, Beijing entered the fray and the world came perilously close to an atomic third world war. Yet, much like the war in Ukraine, it soon became a stalemate. The Korean war then dragged on for two more years before the armistice that is still in operation today was signed. \nHopefully nothing as devastating or risky as the Korean war will result from this new alliance between Russia and North Korea. But it is important to understand that this relationship has a long history. Its roots are in an earlier bloody conflict from a time when the leaders in Moscow and Pyongyang felt isolated and were willing to take dangerous measures to change this situation.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Russia, North Korea, Vladimir Putin, Kim Jung Un, Ukraine invasion 2022, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

But analysis has always been hampered by a scarcity of well-preserved human remains from Pleistocene sites. So, in fact, little is known about the dietary practices of that time. \nI\u2019m a a PhD candidate studying this subject in Morocco, and was part of a research team that uncovered some new insights into the Stone Age diet.\nUsing novel research techniques, we found evidence that our Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer ancestors in north Africa had a heavily plant-based diet, thousands of years before the advent of agriculture. \n\n\n\n\n\nMost studies of pre-agricultural populations have been conducted at European and Asian Palaeolithic sites, so our understanding of the diet during this period has been largely based on findings from those regions. Our knowledge has also been limited by the poor preservation of certain materials in arid regions like north Africa. \nOur research changes this. It challenges the long-held belief that hunter-gatherers primarily relied on animal protein, and adds to what\u2019s known about pre-agricultural diets across different regions.\nChemical traces in bones and teeth\nImagine being able to tell what someone ate thousands of years ago just by examining their bones and teeth.\nThis is possible thanks to a fascinating technique called isotopic analysis. Isotopes are tiny chemical markers of the food we eat that get stored in our bones and teeth. They can be preserved for thousands of years. By studying them, we can learn directly about the diets of ancient humans.\nSince the 1970s, scientists have used stable isotope analysis to learn about the diets and lifestyles of ancient human groups by analysing collagen protein in their bones. Collagen is a protein found in connective tissue, skin, tendon, bone, and cartilage. For example, carbon isotope analysis was used to detect the maize consumption of prehistoric people in North America. Researchers have also used this technique to compare the diets of Neanderthals and early modern humans (Homo sapiens) in Europe.\nTogether with an international team of scientists, I analysed the teeth and bones of people buried in Taforalt Cave in the north-east of Morocco. The burials were deliberate. Researchers have referred to the site as a cemetery due to the organised nature of the burials and the long period over which they occurred. The cave is one of the best-studied sites in north-west Africa for the Palaeolithic period. It is likely the oldest cemetery in north Africa. It has some of the oldest ancient human DNA in Africa, which has allowed scientists to characterise human genetic ancestry in this region. \n\nThe human burials, associated with the Iberomaurusian culture, were radiocarbon dated to between 15,100 and 13,900 years ago. Zoologists have identified that the population hunted Barbary sheep and other animal species in their surroundings, such as gazelles, hartebeest, and equids. The macrobotanical remains recovered from the site show that they also had access to a variety of plant species native to the Mediterranean region, including sweet acorns, pine nuts, oats, beans, and pistachios.\nWe looked at isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, strontium, sulphur and zinc. Different foods leave unique isotopic \u201cfingerprints\u201d. For instance, meat, plants and seafood have distinct carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios, which help us determine what kinds of foods people were eating.\nWe also used cutting-edge techniques involving zinc isotopes developed by one of my PhD supervisors,  Klervia Jaouen, which we applied to tooth enamel. This method, combined with analyses of amino acids, allowed us to further differentiate between plant and animal sources in the diet. \nThis innovative approach gave us a clearer and more detailed picture of what ancient diets looked like, shedding light on how these people adapted to their environment long before anyone started farming crops.\nSurprising diet for hunter-gatherers\nWe analysed tooth enamel and bones from seven individuals from the cave of Taforalt and various isolated teeth. Our analysis revealed something unexpected: instead of a meat-heavy diet, the isotopic signatures showed a significant reliance on wild plants. We also found minimal evidence of seafood or freshwater food consumption, which was surprising given their proximity to water sources. Our research indicated that while the Iberomaurusians did consume some meat, their diet relied heavily on wild plants which they might have stored to provide a food supply through the year.\nOne of the interesting discoveries we made was that a baby started eating solid foods at the early age of around six to 12 months. This baby was apparently given plant-based foods, probably as porridge or soup. This gives us a fascinating glimpse into how hunter gatherers took care of their children in the past.\nThe findings also help explain why tooth cavities were common among the people of Taforalt. They ate a lot of starchy foods, which can lead to cavities, especially since they didn\u2019t have toothbrushes or good dental hygiene back then. The plant bits would get stuck in their teeth and cause decay, leading to tooth problems.\nPeople who were mainly hunters would have to follow a nomadic lifestyle. At Taforalt, however, archaeologists found grinding stones likely used for plant processing. The use of the cave as a burial site, in addition to heavy plant consumption, suggests that this population might have already been leading a more settled lifestyle, exploiting available food resources from the surrounding area.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Chemical traces in ancient West African pots show a diet rich in plants\n\n\n\n\nLooking forward\nThese findings challenge the traditional view that a heavy reliance on plant-based diets started only with agriculture. The Iberomaurusians were consuming a lot of wild plants 8,000 years before farming began in Morocco. This suggests that early humans were more adaptable and resourceful in their dietary habits than previously thought. Understanding this helps us appreciate the complexity and flexibility of human diets in prehistory and how these dietary practices influenced our evolution and health.\nOur study also shows how novel isotopic techniques can give us detailed insights into our ancestors\u2019 diets, helping us understand the foundations of human nutrition.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Agriculture, Diet, Morocco, Teeth, Neolithic revolution, North Africa, Stone age, Later Stone Age, Animal protein, Isotopic analysis, Hunter-gatherers, Neolithic period, Research highlights Africa","role":"assistant"}]}

That\u2019s when they came up with a new name for it: \u201chyperbolic discounting\u201d.\nMost of us put things off\nBefore then, economists had no problem explaining people putting things off. We\u2019d long had the concept of a \u201cdiscount rate\u201d to explain why we do it.\nIf I offered you a choice of finishing an unpleasant task this month in return for $100, or finishing it a year later for 5% less, you are pretty likely to opt for finishing it a year later in return for 5% less. \nEconomists would say that meant your \u201cdiscount rate\u201d (the rate at which you discount what happens in the future) was greater than 5% per year.\nIt\u2019s an incredibly useful concept, and one of the reasons we want to be paid interest when we lend money or deposit money in a fixed-term account.\nYes, it will be nice to get our money back \u2013 but getting it back when the loan ends won\u2019t feel as good as having it now. If our discount rate is 5% per year, getting the full amount back then will be worth 5% less to us per year, so we will want interest of 5% per year.\nVoters and politicians discount the future\nIt\u2019s also how governments and businesses decide whether to fund major projects. If their discount rates are 5% (they are usually higher) and the eventual payoff from the project works out at less than 5% per year, it isn\u2019t worth it. As a species, we are more concerned about what happens now than what happens in the future.\nAt least that\u2019s what was taught at universities in 1970s: everyone has their own personal discount rate. For patient people it is low, and for impatient people it is higher. If you can find out what it is, you can find out what they should do. \nExcept that many of us don\u2019t behave like that at all. We appear to have a discount rate, but it changes \u2013 dramatically \u2013 the closer we get to a deadline.\nNear deadlines, our behaviour becomes extreme\nRemember when I asked about finishing an unpleasant task this month or a year later? You might well have given an answer that implied a discount rate near 5%.\nYou would have probably given a similar answer if I asked about finishing the task a year after that, in 2027 instead of 2026. Your discount rate would be near 5%.\nExcept for the week before the task is due. In that week, you might well be prepared to sacrifice almost anything \u2013 an awful lot \u2013 to put it off for another week or another month, or two months or a year. Your discount rate would be off the charts.\nOn a chart, it wouldn\u2019t look like a straight line \u2013  5% or so per year \u2013 it would like a hyperbola, a line that had suddenly climbed enormously high. That has also been used to describe the concept of hyperbolic discounting.\n\nActing like a hyperbolic discounter \u2013 pushing out a deadline as it becomes imminent, even if it costs more to meet it later \u2013 as the Coalition now says it will do the 2030 emissions reduction target, is a way to never meet a deadline.\nOf course, the Coalition says it won\u2019t cost more to meet the final deadline of net-zero by 2050 because by then we will have nuclear power. \nIt\u2019s a familiar argument to those of us who want to put things off. Something will come along that will make them easier to do later. If it doesn\u2019t, maybe we will behave like a hyperbolic discounter again. Not that we expect to.\nNuclear power mightn\u2019t make future choices easier\nExcept that the unexpected happens. Cost overruns are notorious in building nuclear power plants, even in countries that have lots of them and they are often delivered late.\nAnd electricity is responsible for only one-third of Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting electricity emissions to zero (a road we are already on, they\u2019ve been falling since 2015) will leave another two-thirds of emissions untouched.\nThat\u2019s unless we rapidly electrify other sources of emissions such as cars and trucks and the use of gas for heating, a transition the Coalition remains reluctant to embrace.\nIt\u2019s hard to meet deadlines. Right now the government is on track to miss its 2030 emissions target of 43% below 2005 levels, although its officials say it is on track for 42% and it thinks it can make up the difference.\nIt\u2019s tempting to put things off. If the Coalition persuades us, it\u2019s because we are highly persuadable. Most of us don\u2019t like hard choices now. We like them later.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Net zero emissions","role":"assistant"}]}

These nets are expensive to repair, and dolphins are sometimes caught, injured or killed.\nEconomic loss as a result of dolphins\u2019 interference with purse seiners is difficult to estimate. The Food and Agricultural Organisation has estimated  up to 36% losses by fishers and between 9% and 19% per ship annually in Morocco. The agency, in conjunction with the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, is developing a protocol for better data collection.\nIn Morocco, aquatic mammals like dolphins and whales are protected by national and international legislation and the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (Accobams) ratification law of 1999.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut it\u2019s hard to protect a population when there\u2019s not much information about the threats it faces.\nA major challenge faced by the Moroccan Mediterranean fisheries sector is the lack of quantitative data on the interactions between bottlenose dolphins and purse-seiners. Only a few Mediterranean studies contain sufficient information to evaluate both the number of dolphins caught by mistake and the so-called \u201cdepredation\u201d \u2013  attacks on the fishing gear by the dolphins. \nAs a PhD researcher completing my research on bycatch of vulnerable species in the Moroccan Mediterranean Sea, I joined a team of other marine biologists to conduct a study in the Al Hoceima region.\nOur study was carried out in 2020 in Al Hoceima Bay, some 150km east of the Strait of Gibraltar. Using on-board observers and questionnaires, we determined the mortality rate of bottlenose dolphins and the financial losses incurred by fishermen in repairing nets attacked by bottlenose dolphins.\nOur goals were to assess this interaction and identify ways to reduce the conflict. \nWe found that on average, more than two dolphins were caught on each of 48 trips. The mean cost of repairing damage to the nets was US$179 per incident. Sometimes it cost up to US$1,000. These costs have made fishing less attractive in the region. The seiners have shifted their activity to other areas  since the 2010s.  \nThe dolphins\nThe bottlenose dolphins prey on the fish that the fishers catch and are attracted by the way the nets concentrate the fish in one place.\nAs a result, they sometimes get caught in the nets. This results in death or physical injury to dolphins. \nOur research revealed that a total of 121 dolphins were captured in nets during 48 fishing trips (four trips per month throughout 2020). Eleven of the dolphins died. Each trip included one to three fishing operations, depending on the seine tear rate. The number of fishing operations observed was 94 in total.\n\nThe Mediterranean bottlenose dolphin subpopulation is still classified as \u201cLeast Concern\u201d by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However, there are concerns about the decline of bottlenose dolphins in the Mediterranean.\nThe fishers\nThe Moroccan fishermen who fish along the Mediterranean coast are frustrated by the negative impacts that dolphin behaviour has on their industry. \nIn terms of damage to fishing gear, we observed between 28 and 230 holes per net per incident. Some were large, but the majority were smaller than 35cm. The cost of repairing the holes in nets caused by these interactions was estimated at US$179.52 per repair, which is costly for the fishers. For large holes the repair took from 24 to 72 hours. While the large holes were repaired, the fishermen continued fishing by using their spare net. Repairs required the hiring of 3 to 11 net menders, depending on the size and number of holes. \nIn Moroccan Mediterranean ports, small pelagic fish fisheries provide the greatest socio-economic benefits for the fishing industry. For the port city of Al Hoceima, purse seining for small pelagic fish plays an important role in the local economy. It provides 315 direct and 100 indirect jobs. In 2020, Al Hoceima purse-seiners made a total of 315 fishing trips, harvesting just over 669 tonnes in total, compared to 5,123 tonnes in 2015. This shows the direct impact of these dolphin interactions on jobs and the drop in fishermen\u2019s income. \nWhat must be done about it\nThere is a need for further research into bottlenose dolphin behaviour and mitigation strategies. This should include the possibility of using acoustic devices that emit sound waves to discourage bottlenose dolphins from purse seines. Research into alternative fishing techniques  will also be valuable. \nThere should also be a compensation scheme to design effective conservation strategies and to improve the ecological and economic sustainability of the purse-seine fishery.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Morocco, Dolphins, Dolphin conservation, Bycatch, Fishermen, Dolphin bycatch, Mediterranean Sea, Natural world","role":"assistant"}]}

On the first day in town, he would stand on the side of the road as his white self, seeing who, if anyone, would stop and offer him a ride. On the second day, he stuck out his thumb on the same shoulder, but this time in what I\u2019d describe as \u201cmochaface.\u201d\nSince September is hot, he set a two-hour limit for his experiments. During his seven white days, he was offered, but did not take, seven rides. On seven subsequent Black days, he was offered, but did not take, one ride. He speculated that day was a fluke.\nForster is not the first white person to center themselves in the discussion of American racism by pretending to be Black.\nHis wish mirrors that of the white people featured in my 2017 book, \u201cBlack for a Day: White Fantasies of Race and Empathy.\u201d The book tells the history of what I call \u201cempathetic racial impersonation,\u201d in which white people indulge in their fantasies of being Black under the guise of empathizing with the Black experience.  \nTo me, these endeavors are futile. They end up reinforcing stereotypes and failing to address systemic racism, while conferring a false sense of racial authority.\nGoing undercover in the South\n\nThe genealogy begins in the late 1940s with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Ray Sprigle.\nSprigle, a white reporter at the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, decided he wanted to experience postwar racism by \u201cbecoming\u201d a Black man. After unsuccessfully trying to darken his skin beyond a tan, Sprigle shaved his head, put on giant glasses and traded his signature, 10-gallon hat for an unassuming cap. For four weeks beginning in May 1948, Sprigle navigated the Jim Crow South as a light-skinned Black man named James Rayel Crawford. \nSprigle documented dilapidated sharecropper\u2019s cabins, segregated schools and women widowed by lynching. What he witnessed \u2013 but did not experience \u2013 informed his 21-part series of front page articles for the Post-Gazette. He followed up the series by publishing a widely panned 1949 memoir, \u201cIn the Land of Jim Crow.\u201d \nSprigle never won that second Pulitzer.\nCosplaying as Black\nSprigle\u2019s more famous successor, John Howard Griffin, published his memoir, \u201cBlack Like Me,\u201d in 1961. \nLike Sprigle, Griffin explored the South as a temporary Black man, darkening his skin with pills intended to treat vitiligo, a skin disease that causes splotchy losses of pigmentation. He also used stains to even his skin tone and spent time under a tanning lamp. \nDuring his weeks as \u201cJoseph Franklin,\u201d Griffin encountered racism on a number of occasions: White thugs chased him, bus drivers refused to let him disembark to pee, store managers denied him work, closeted, gay white men aggressively hit on him, and otherwise nice-seeming white people grilled him with what Griffin called the \u201chate stare.\u201d Once Griffin resumed being white and news broke about his racial experiment, his white neighbors from his hometown in Mansfield, Texas, hanged him in effigy. \nFor his work, Griffin was lauded as an icon in empathy. Since, unlike Sprigle, he experienced racist incidents himself, Griffin showed skeptical white readers what they refused to believe: Racism was real. The book became a bestseller and a movie, and is still included in school curricula \u2013 at the expense, I might add, of African-American literature.\n\nGriffin\u2019s importance to this genealogy extends beyond middle-schoolers reading \u201cBlack Like Me,\u201d to his successor and mentee, Grace Halsell. \nHalsell, a freelance journalist and former staff writer for Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration, decided to \u201cbecome\u201d a Black woman \u2013 first in Harlem in New York City, and then in Mississippi.\nWithout consulting any Black woman before baking herself caramel in tropical suns and using Griffin\u2019s doctors to administer vitiligo-corrective medication, Halsell initially planned to \u201cbe\u201d Black for a year. But after alleging someone attempted to sexually assault her while she was working as a Black domestic worker, Halsell ended her stint as a Black woman early. \nAlthough her experiment only lasted six months, she still claimed to be someone who could authentically represent her \u201cdarker sisters\u201d in her 1969 memoir, \u201cSoul Sister.\u201d\nTurn-of-the-century \u2018race switching\u2019\nForster writes that his 2024 memoir is the \u201cfourth act\u201d \u2013 after Sprigle, Griffin and Halsell \u2013 of what he calls \u201cjournalistic blackface.\u201d \nHowever, he is not, as he claims, \u201cthe first person to earnestly cross the color barrier in over half a century.\u201d \nIn a 174-page book self-described as \u201cgonzo\u201d with only 17 citations, Forster failed to finish his homework. \nIn 1994, Joshua Solomon, a white college student, medically dyed his skin to \u201cbecome\u201d a Black man after reading \u201cBlack Like Me.\u201d His originally planned, monthlong experiment in Georgia only lasted a few days. But he nonetheless detailed his experiences in an article for The Washington Post and netted an appearance on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show.\u201d\nThen, in 2006, FX released, \u201cBlack. White.,\u201d a six-part reality television series advertised as the \u201cultimate racial experiment.\u201d \nTwo families \u2013 one white, the other Black \u2013 \u201cswitched\u201d their races to perform versions of each-otherness while living together in Los Angeles. While the makeup team won a Primetime Emmy Award, the families said goodbye seething with resentment instead of understanding.\nA masterclass of white arrogance\nBelieving it would distract from the findings of his experiment, Forster refuses to show readers his mochaface. \nEven after confronting evidence forcing him to question his project\u2019s appropriateness, like the multiple articles condemning \u201cwearing makeup to imitate the appearance of a Black person,\u201d he insists his insights into American racism justify his methods and are different from the harmful legacies of blackface. As he stands on the side of the road, sun and sweat compromising whatever care he took to paint his face, Forster concludes that racism can be divided into two broad taxonomies: institutional and interpersonal.\nThe former, he believes, \u201cis effectively dead,\u201d and the latter is most often experienced as \u201cshoulder,\u201d like the subtle refusal to pick up a mocha-faced hitchhiker.\nForster\u2019s Amazon book description touts \u201cSeven Shoulders\u201d as \u201cthe most important book on American race relations that has ever been written.\u201d\nIndeed, it is a masterclass \u2013 but one on the arrogance of white assumptions about Blackness. \nTo believe that the richness of Black identity can be understood through a temporary costume trivializes the lifelong trauma of racism. It turns the complexity of Black life into a stunt. \nWhether it\u2019s Forster\u2019s premise that Black people are ill-equipped to testify about their own experiences, his sketchy citations, the hubris of his caricature or the venom with which he speaks about the Black Lives Matter movement, Forster offers an important reminder that liberation can\u2019t be bought at the drugstore.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"United States, Identity, Race, Racism, Journalism, Books, Canada, Empathy, Social psychology, Black Americans, Blackface, Canadian journalism, White people, Ignorance","role":"assistant"}]}

It promises one-hour delivery and 30% off, and the next thing you know your Friday night has an entirely different trajectory.\nIt\u2019s no secret the alcohol industry flocks to social media to promote its products. But to what extent is this really a problem?\nOur research published today in Drug and Alcohol Review reveals that, on average, a large proportion of young social media users in Australia are exposed to alcohol ads more than every three minutes. \nRegulations? What regulations?\nIn Australia, alcohol companies are responsible for regulating their own advertising behaviours. But there is no evidence this model successfully protects vulnerable populations, such as minors (under 18) and young adults, from exposure to alcohol ads, nor to potentially harmful messages regarding alcohol consumption.\nThis has resulted in an abundance of alcohol ads targeting young adults and even minors, without consequences from an overarching regulatory body.\nResearch has found products advertised using youth-oriented genres, reward appeals and stylistic features (such as animations) are more likely to be consumed by underage drinkers than by adults of legal drinking age.\nAnd since social media ads reach millions of viewers, it\u2019s no surprise 39% of 12\u201317-year-olds in Australia report having seen alcohol advertising online. The lack of regulation means there\u2019s growing concern about the effects these ads may have on young people\u2019s attitudes towards drinking. \nA number of studies have found correlations between exposure to online alcohol ads and increased youth consumption, increased likelihood of drinking at a younger age, and the adoption of riskier drinking patterns.\nOne ad every three minutes\nWe set out to determine how often Australians aged between 17 and 24 were exposed to alcohol-related ads on social media, as well as what advertising qualities were present in these ads.\nTo do this, we recruited 125 students from the University of Queensland to scroll through Facebook or Instagram for a 30 minutes, screenshotting any alcohol-related ads they encountered. \nWe found 71 of our participants encountered an alcohol-related ad during this period. Alarmingly, five were under the legal drinking age of 18. In total, our participants came across 796 ads, encountering one ad every two minutes and 43 seconds on average.\nThese ads often promoted products using sales incentives such as bonus samples, promotional codes, or special offers. They also commonly emphasised the \u201cease\u201d with which the product could be purchased, such as through a subscription or home delivery service.\nAlmost every ad also included some form of call to action, whether that was a link to more information about the product, or to an online storefront to purchase it.\nYouth drinking\nGlobally, we continue to see a gradual decline in drinking among young adults. Nonetheless, the National Drug Strategy Household Survey 2022\u20132023 found about 42% of people aged 18\u201324 engaged in risky levels of drinking. This figure was 5.5% for minors aged 14\u201317.\nIn this case, \u201crisky\u201d drinking was defined as having either more than ten standard drinks per week (on average) in the previous 12 months, or more than four drinks in a single day, at least once a month, over the previous 12 months.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to quantify the extent to which alcohol ads on social media translate to youth consumption, it\u2019s not a stretch to suggest this content (which promotes the affordability and availability of alcohol) has some kind of impact. \nIn 2022\u201323, people aged 18\u201324 were the most likely to be victims of alcohol-related incidents, including physical and verbal abuse. So it\u2019s important we monitor how alcohol is portrayed to this age group.\nThinking forward\nResearchers recognise the need to investigate the impact of social media alcohol ads on young people\u2019s drinking behaviours. However, research alone can\u2019t minimise the risks.\nIn Europe, countries such as Finland, Norway and Sweden have implemented independent statutory bodies to ensure alcohol ads comply with their respective codes. Some have taken this even further, with Lithuania prohibiting alcohol companies from advertising online, and both Finland and Estonia prohibiting alcohol ads on social media.\nIn Australia, the introduction of an independent alcohol advertising administration would go a long way towards protecting minors and young adults from exposure to marketing that promotes underage or risky drinking. \nOr, we could take a page from our neighbour\u2019s book. The Association of New Zealand Advertisers offers a voluntary liquor advertising pre-vetting service to help alcohol companies comply with the country\u2019s advertising code. A similar tool could be useful in Australia if it was mandated. Such a tool could hold both alcohol and social media companies accountable for targeting vulnerable people.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Social media, Alcohol, Alcohol advertising, Alcohol policy, Drinking, Underage drinking, Advertising standards, Youth drinking","role":"assistant"}]}

Managers directly supervise employees and employees are paid based on their performance.   \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution contributed to a desire to apply scientific management to the organisation of work. Taylorism fed directly into our treatment of factory workers as elements in the workflow that needed to be monitored and controlled. \nThe ghost of Taylorism is evident in our increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) to replace human labour. Chaplin understood that the machine metaphor was more than just better technology, it was a kind of template for how people ought to behave. \nStories about scandals vilify the people involved \u2013 ex-Post Office boss Paula Vennells is the most recent example. Individuals do carry responsibility, but blaming bad leaders is easier than accepting that institutions and governments are culpable. \nMy field (organisational behaviour) has contributed to this problem by being servants to industry. The mantra to measure, quantify and modify adds a sliver of scientific respectability to the fields of business and management. But it can lead to a blind spot around how organisational systems can evolve to damage people. Executive behaviour in the Enron, Boeing and the UK Post office scandals were motivated by \u201cgood\u201d business principles \u2013 protecting the company. Protecting institutions can seem ethical.   \nBut organisational scandals are a reminder of what happens when efficiency is championed over personal experiences, and dysfunctional systems are defended. The Horizon Post Office scandal highlighted the worst elements of the scientific management culture in the \u201cefficient\u201d way that the sub-postmasters were hounded.\nIt was also evident in the delay in getting to the truth because no one would admit that the technology could be wrong. This approach is nothing new. Initially, fans were blamed for Hillsborough, and pilots for the problems with Boeing 737 Max.\nCan organisations change?\nIn these scandals, the institutions and corporations skilfully control the narrative until their bubble of lies or incomplete accounts bursts. Enforced transparency and a fair playing field could break this pattern. A Hillsborough law, introducing a legally enforceable \u201cduty of candour\u201d for police and public authorities in investigations, and equal legal funding for bereaved families at inquiries and inquests, would be one way to avoid the David versus Goliath journey. \nThe absence of convictions or meaningful repercussions following almost all scandals is abysmal. Restorative justice has a role to play, but wilfully perverting the course of public justice needs to be sanctioned.\nWe can\u2019t depend on leaders to do the right thing if we keep educating them to put their mission first and people second. We promote and hire on the basis that leaders put their organisations first. The overused explanation of a \u201cbad\u201d culture being responsible for dysfunctional organisations simply means that everybody clearly understood the real vision and objectives, and committed to doing what was needed. \nOrganisations frequently don\u2019t want to talk about failures or even apparently to learn from them (we can take the Columbia space shuttle and 737 Boeing Max tragedies as examples of this). Similarly, employee silence is common and whistleblowing rare. The DNA of business education is flawed, with ethics and social justice seen as peripheral issues.\n\nWe need to start by accepting that organisations will do anything to maximise profit and shareholder value, and reverse-engineer from this point. \nFor example, accepting that accidents are likely can protect people from organisational dysfunction. Commercial air travel is one of the safest industries in the world, and the success is based on the fact that plane crashes are impossible to hide. Aviation (like nuclear power operations and chemical industries) are called high-reliability organisations (HROs), which function nearly error-free in extremely challenging and uncertain environments. \nThe key to HROs is that procedures to protect people are mandatory and strictly enforced by experts. They start from the perspective that accidents are very likely if systems are not in place to prevent them. \nImagine how different the Horizon scandal might have been if the Post Office invited sub-postmasters to collaborate in monitoring the new system for potential flaws when it was introduced. \nWe don\u2019t need a team of management consultants and policy advisers to understand that new work procedures might not begin perfectly. The biggest lie at the centre of most organisational failures \u2013 the Horizon Post Office scandal included \u2013 is that something unexpected and unpredictable happened.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Management, Hillsborough disaster, Grenfell Tower, Horizon, Educate me, Post Office Scandal, Infected blood inquiry","role":"assistant"}]}

The decision generated debate among Nigerians, some of whom felt it did not rank on the list of social, economic and security challenges confronting the country. Samuel Oyewole, a political scientist, says it is a \u201cdistract and rule\u201d tactic, which he described in his published research as serving the political elite\u2019s goal of a democracy in name only and promoting a democratic setup where people\u2019s involvement in governance is not respected.\nThe recent change to Nigeria\u2019s national anthem was rushed through the legislature. What does that say about Nigerian politics?\nWhile the majority of Nigerians are preoccupied with how to make ends meet, their representatives in Abuja prioritised changing the national anthem, and without any public hearing (participation). \nThe  first and second reading of the bill at the floor of the Senate was on 23 May and it was passed on 28 May and signed by the president the next day.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the House of Representatives, the bill passed through first, second and third reading on the same day. \nBased on the available record of the National Assembly, that is unusually fast. \nMany other bills that are relevant to the welfare of the citizens are stuck at first reading in the same Senate. Some of these include the Inflation Reduction Programme (Special Provisions) Bill and the Child Right Act (Amendment) Bill, waiting since 7 February, and the Government Performance and Accountability Bill, waiting since 22 February. \nInstead of reviewing the performance of the government under Tinubu and the 10th National Assembly, public attention was dominated by discourse on the national anthem.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Naira is in crisis but cryptocurrency isn't to blame \u2013 Nigeria needs consistent policy\n\n\n\n\nHow is the change of national anthem a distraction strategy?\n\u201cDivide and rule\u201d is a familiar feature of Nigerian politics. Political elites have perfected the art of dividing the people along ethnic, religious and regional lines. \nHowever, this is only a tactic in the broader strategy of \u201cdistract and rule\u201d. This seeks to draw people\u2019s attention away from serious governance challenges that affect their lives, to focus instead on trivial issues. \nThe whole point is to maintain a \u201cdemocracy\u201d without the participation or representation of the people. \nHas this strategy of distraction been effective?\nPublic opinion has been divided on the reintroduction of the old anthem. Some Nigerians, especially the older generation that are familiar with the old (now new) anthem and supporters of the ruling party, have welcomed the move. \nOthers are indifferent to the anthem change as they feel it does not affect their socioeconomic and security realities. \nThe socioeconomic realities prompted the Nigerian Labour Congress and its affiliated unions to declare an indefinite strike on 3 June 2024, to demand a living minimum wage. The strike shut down the economy, as the power grid, airports and other critical sectors were shut down. \nAlthough the strike was suspended on the second day for renewed negotiation with government, it brought attention back from the national anthem.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Nigeria\u2019s fuel subsidy removal was too sudden: why a gradual approach would have been better\n\n\n\n\nHow has Tinubu\u2019s administration fared thus far?\nAt his inauguration on 29 May 2023, President Tinubu gave a message of hope amid rising inflation, growing public debt, pervasive insecurity, a legally contested election and a deeply polarised polity. \nHe also announced the removal of the petroleum subsidy. But he had no plan for the aftermath. \nThe unsubsidised petrol price jumped from 145 naira (US$0.324) per litre in May to 617 naira (US$0.7802) in July 2023. The cost of living skyrocketed. \nThe government claimed that removing the subsidy saved 1.45 trillion naira (US$976 million)  between June and September. But Nigeria reportedly spent 3.6 trillion naira (US$2.4 billion) on the subsidy in 2023. \nTo address the shortage of foreign exchange, the administration also allowed for free flow of the naira. The currency dropped in value by 40.78% from 471.67 naira to 664.04 naira against the dollar in June 2023. \nBy February 2024, the naira was 1,542.58 per dollar and was predicted to reach  2,081, before it was relatively stabilised between 1,200 and 1,400 to a dollar at the official rate in March 2024.  \nOnce the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria is set to slide to the fourth position in 2024. \nThe economic policy has worsened inflation, which rose from 22.22% to 33.69% between April 2023 and April 2024.\nAlthough the president promised to review the minimum wage in June 2023 and outlined eight weeks to reach an agreement with the unions, it remained at 30,000 naira (about US$21.76) per month one year into his administration. \nThe World Bank projected that the share of the population below the international poverty line would increase from 30.9% to 40.7% by the end of 2024. \nIn addition to a crippling economic crisis, Nigeria is battling with security challenges, including terrorism, insurgency, armed banditry, illegal mining, kidnapping, smuggling and other organised criminal violence. \nDespite the efforts of the Nigerian military, which killed 6,880 criminals, apprehended 6,970 others and rescued 4,488 hostages in 2023, the security situation has not improved.  \nAnalysis by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project shows that Nigeria recorded 4,556 fatalities and 7,086 abductions between 29 May 2023 and 22 May 2024, compared to 2,606 fatalities and 3,523 abductions in the previous year. \nThese are the real challenges facing the country and they highlight the many failures of Tinubu\u2019s year in office.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Politics, Economy, Democracy, Inflation, Nigeria, legislature, Insecurity, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nOpposition leader Peter Dutton on Tuesday reiterated the Coalition\u2019s support for the Paris climate agreement, following suggestions he might walk away from the deal. But he fuelled speculation the Coalition plans to scrap Australia\u2019s current 2030 emissions target and confirmed he won\u2019t announce the Coalition\u2019s proposed target before the election.\nDutton\u2019s comments follow days of confusion about where the Coalition stands on Australia\u2019s emissions reduction goals. Nationals MPs Barnaby Joyce and Keith Pitt reportedly want the Coalition to withdraw from the Paris climate  agreement. And over the weekend, Dutton said the Albanese government \u201cjust have no hope of achieving the [2030] targets and there\u2019s no sense signing up to targets you don\u2019t have any prospect of achieving\u201d.\nSpeaking on Tuesday, Dutton said of the Coalition\u2019s climate policy:\n\nwe\u2019re not going to send the economy into freefall, and families bankrupt, through an ideologically based approach, which is what Anthony Albanese is doing at the moment.\n\nSo what would happen if a Dutton government weakened Australia\u2019s 2030 targets \u2013 a 43% cut on 2005 levels \u2013 or if the Coalition\u2019s more conservative elements succeeded and the Coalition abandoned Australia\u2019s Paris commitment altogether?\nAt this stage, it\u2019s virtually impossible to imagine Australia walking away from the Paris deal. But even watering down our 2030 targets would have significant diplomatic and economic repercussions. Either way, climate policy is looming as a major issue heading into the next election.\n\nThe 2030 targets must stay\nLet\u2019s say a Coalition government decided to drop Australia\u2019s 2030 targets, but remain signed up to the Paris agreement, and the broader goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. \nThis would technically be possible. However, it is clearly inconsistent with the spirit of the Paris agreement, which asks that nations ratchet-up their emissions reduction commitments over time.\nAnd abandoning the 2030 goal would make it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for Australia to reach net-zero by 2050. As others have noted, the 43% target already falls short of what is needed for Australia to do its share on emissions reduction under the Paris Agreement, and is less ambitious than the targets adopted by our international peers.\nThis brings us to Coalition suggestions that Australia has no prospect of meeting the 43% target, and so should not be signed up to it. This is a ridiculous argument. \nFirst, the 43% target is not unachievable. The latest forecasts suggest Australia is on track to cutting emissions by 42% by 2030.\nEmissions targets signal that a government is working towards something. They encourage aspiration and action. They incentivise investment in some areas \u2013 such as renewable energy \u2013 and disincentivise investment elsewhere, such as in fossil fuels. A target\u2019s legitimacy isn\u2019t determined by whether it is wholly met.\nHaving said that, the Coalition\u2019s line of attack should be a wake-up call to the Albanese government to make sure the 43% target is achieved.\n\nWhat about nuclear?\nThe Coalition\u2019s climate and energy policy hinges, controversially, on the introduction of a nuclear power industry in Australia. \nNationals leader David Littleproud on Monday said the Coalition remains committed to the goal of net-zero by 2050, but most emissions reduction would occur towards the end of that period when nuclear power is up and running. He said the Coalition would have interim targets out to 2050 \u201cbut we won\u2019t have a linear pathway\u201d to net-zero.\nThe idea that nuclear could be part of the solution to Australia\u2019s energy transition is nonsense. Evidence abounds to support this, including a report by the CSIRO last month which found a nuclear plant would cost at least A$8.6 billion, and electricity from nuclear power in Australia would be at least 50% more expensive than solar and wind.\nEstablishing a nuclear energy capacity in Australia would be prohibitively expensive and just not feasible. What\u2019s more, the long-term economic costs would be huge. Not least are the eye-watering costs of dealing with the effects of climate change should the world, including Australia, not reduce emissions dramatically.\nAustralia on the global stage\nIncreasingly around the world, nations that fail to act on climate change risk being penalised economically in the form of carbon tariffs. These are taxes applied to imports, according to the volume of greenhouse gas emissions released in their production. \nThe policy is designed to ensure manufacturers operating in nations with strict emissions policies in place, such as a carbon price, are not undercut by manufacturers in higher-emitting countries. The European Union introduced such a policy in  2023. The US is also considering a version of the policy.\nAustralian exporters risk significant economic costs if our federal government does not adopt a serious emissions reduction strategy.\nThen there is the question of Australia\u2019s international reputation. Stepping back on climate change goals does not align with the image we have of ourselves: as a good international citizen that helps advance responses to challenging transnational problems.\nMore directly, it would badly undermine Australia\u2019s relationships with its Pacific neighbours, for whom climate change is an existential threat \u2013 perhaps even pushing those countries closer to China.\nThe results of the next presidential election in the United States, however, pose a danger. There, conservatives have reportedly drafted a plan for a future Trump administration to leave the Paris agreement, as it did in 2020.\nIf a major global power, and Australia\u2019s biggest ally, withdraws from the deal, it may provide cover for a future Australian government to do the same.\n\nThe climate wars continue\nFrom a domestic political point of view, it\u2019s unclear what the Coalition hopes to achieve by raising the prospect of a walk-back on climate action. Such a policy would, for example, make it acutely difficult for the Coalition to win back teal seats it lost at the last election.\nA recent Lowy poll found 57% of Australians think global warming \u201cis a serious and pressing problem and that we should begin taking steps now, even if it involves significant costs\u201d.\nFollowing the last election, hopes were high that Australia\u2019s frustrating climate wars may be over. The results suggested the Coalition\u2019s only pathway back to power would have to involve a legitimate climate policy. The Coalition\u2019s latest rhetoric suggests it does not agree.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Peter Dutton, Barnaby Joyce, Climate policy, Emissions targets, Paris Agreement, Keith Pitt","role":"assistant"}]}

He worked at a brewhouse but struggled to secure care for his youngest child, William, who was about 5 years old and nearly blind. \nBarbra Sion, a 74-year-old woman living in Southwark, was recorded by welfare officials as \u201cold, sickly, cared for by an adopted child.\u201d \nIn order to remain in their homes and care for their loved ones, both Philadelphians sought financial support through the Guardians of the Poor, the elected government officials who managed local welfare programs. But in the 1810s and 1820s, these pensions came under suspicion in Philadelphia. Were families like the Kingleys or the Sions really deserving of support, or were they faking it?\nAs a scholar of early American history, a historian of disability and a disabled individual, I am acutely attuned to arguments about disability spanning the founding of the U.S. to the present day. While researching the daily experiences of disabled Philadelphians in the early 1800s, I discovered the records of the Guardians of the Poor at the Philadelphia City Archives. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn my research, published in the spring 2024 issue of the Journal of the Early Republic, I explore how and why the Guardians of the Poor, alongside other welfare reformers, began rationing care and outlawing pensions.\nGuardians of the Poor\nIn the early 1800s, Philadelphia, like most early American cities, had a diversified welfare state. \nThe Guardians of the Poor levied poor taxes on every home. They used this money to purchase everyday goods such as firewood, food and clothing for the poor, and also to distribute weekly pensions to families in need.\nThey also supported public institutions like the Philadelphia Almshouse, which provided shelter and met the basic needs for the city\u2019s poorest people. And they purchased spots in the Pennsylvania Hospital, where they referred poor people for medical care.  \nWhile the almshouse and hospital were important sites of healing, many disabled households relied on the pension system. Pensioners could get health care in their homes, delivered by physicians hired by the Guardians of the Poor. When provided supplemental income, they could continue working and living independently.\n\nRising poverty, deepening resentment\nLike most Eastern Seaboard cities in the early 1800s, Philadelphia was home to thousands of immigrants and a growing free Black community. It was also experiencing rising unemployment and vagrancy rates, debts from the War of 1812 against Great Britain, and inflation from the Panic of 1819. \nAs more people fell into poverty, more people appealed to the local welfare officials for support. \nTaxpayers, meanwhile, bemoaned the rising costs of welfare, especially the pension system. Why would anyone work, they asked, if the government was just handing out money? Were people really unable to work, or were they just fooling the Guardians of the Poor? There was a pervasive sense that scammers were bleeding coffers dry.\nIn 1817, a citizen group called the Pennsylvania Society for the Promotion of Public Economy launched an investigation into the system. It sent a survey to charities and government officials asking, \u201cWhat do the poor allege as the cause of their poverty?\u201d \nThe charities and officials reported back: \u201cIn most instances want of employment is the alleged cause\u2026[A]lthough this may temporarily operate, idleness, intemperance, and sickness are the most frequently the real causes.\u201d \nThe citizen committee\u2019s report concluded that \u201cthe people of colour; the lower classes of Irish emigrants; the intemperate and day labourers\u201d were wasting taxpayer dollars. \n\nWhile the committee at times highlighted gender wage gaps, high costs of living and other real challenges, it focused foremost on individual behaviors and personal choice. Poor people, the authors believed, were being reckless with their money: They gambled, hired sex workers and drank themselves into poverty.  \nThe report sparked a series of further investigations. In 1821, a state committee was founded to look into the poor laws, and in 1827 the Guardians of the Poor published the results of their own investigation. \nThey all echoed the same narrative: The wrong people were taking advantage of welfare. \nA massive almshouse\nTo cure these social ills, the citizens committee proposed ending pension payments and institutionalizing the poor. Reformers argued it would be far cheaper to house the poor together, where they would be fed, clothed and housed at scale.\nIn Philadelphia, that meant shifting poor taxes to create the Blockley Almshouse, a 3,000-bed facility that served as an almshouse, orphanage, hospital and workhouse on the west bank of the Schuylkill River \u2013 an area that at the time was on the outskirts of the city, far from most residents\u2019 families and communities. \nIn 1902, the facility was renamed Philadelphia General Hospital. It was closed in 1977 and soon thereafter leveled. Today, the space houses a range of facilities owned by the PGH Development Corp.\nAs the Guardians of the Poor manuscript collections held at the Philadelphia City Archives make clear, Blockley Almshouse hired medical professionals to screen those who were admitted and supposedly weed out welfare scammers from those deserving of care.  \nSick and injured individuals were sent to the hospital wards, where they encountered physicians and medical students. Students at the University of Pennsylvania completed their clinical rounds at the almshouse, where they performed surgeries, concocted medications and learned how to diagnose patients.\nBoth disabled and able-bodied poor were sent to the workhouse, where they would perform tasks such as picking oakum \u2013 in which you unravel rope into individual fibers \u2013 spooling thread, sewing clothes or making shoes. Whatever they produced was sold to local markets to fund the institution. \nReformers presumed that most people would find conditions so abhorrent at the almshouse that they would leave and find work in the city instead. \n\nThe so-called scammers\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine what the almshouse could provide for families like the Kingleys or the Sions. These families are just two out of 656 listed in the Register of Relief Recipients maintained by the Guardians of the Poor for the year 1829. \nTranscribing the record book, I found that all 656 households on the pension lists were home to single parents raising children, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, or some combination of the above. Most had lived in the city for decades. \nIronically, Blockley never turned a profit. Philadelphians continued to fund the institution through poor taxes, and the facility never broke even.\nThe real costs, of course, were borne by those forcibly institutionalized, separated into wards by gender and health condition, and detached from family members by the expanse of the river. \nMany lived in abject poverty to escape the facility. In 1830, Mathew Carey, an economist and public figure in Philadelphia, complained that hundreds of Philadelphians who \u201chave been gradually reduced to the most severe distress and penury \u2013 whom honourable men would shudder at seeing inmates of an alms-house, and who, in fact, would rather die than go there\u201d deserved pension support. \nThe shift in welfare laws \u2013 to defund pensions and fund institutions instead \u2013 acted like a net to catch and punish people who were economically dependent. Welfare reformers could have turned an eye on employers, businesses, rental costs or other systemic drivers of poverty. Instead, they focused on supposed scammers who didn\u2019t really exist.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"History, Welfare, Poverty, Hospitals, Disability, US history, Philadelphia, Local","role":"assistant"}]}

It gives you the space, time and resources to handle the most difficult challenges of life. Therapy can be especially helpful in the often-confusing life period of your 20s and 30s, when so much is changing and many of your peers have wildly different lifestyles. \nThe aim is to help you discover the thoughts, emotions and behaviour that are negatively affecting you, determine where these come from, and develop strategies to change them. But then, how do you know when it is the right time to quit therapy?\nFirst, you must consider whether you want to quit therapy altogether, or just quit your current therapist.\nPsychotherapy (therapy that specifically aims to treat mental health) is generally equally or more effective for treating mental health problems than medication. Psychotherapy is also generally more effective at preventing relapse (a return to poor mental health after improvement) than medication. \n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this is not always the case. Occasionally, in about 5-10% of cases, therapy can have adverse effects. These could be a deterioration in symptoms, physical wellbeing, ability to work and function, mood, life satisfaction, relationships, sleep or self-esteem. Not all talking therapies come under the bracket of clinical psychotherapy, but the principles of how and why you should stop them are the same.\n\n\nNo one\u2019s 20s and 30s look the same. You might be saving for a mortgage or just struggling to pay rent. You could be swiping dating apps, or trying to understand childcare. No matter your current challenges, our Quarter Life series has articles to share in the group chat, or just to remind you that you\u2019re not alone.\nRead more from Quarter Life:\n\nWorkplace besties: How to build relationships at work while staying professional\nWant to be an influencer? Our research shows what you need to know first\nRadical Optimism is Dua Lipa\u2019s philosophy for dealing with life\u2019s chaos \u2013 but radical openness is a better approach\n\n\nAdverse effects can occur when there is a breakdown in the therapist-client relationship. If you do not trust your therapist, have experienced damaging interactions with them, feel they do not have your best interests at heart, think the therapy they provide is ineffective, or generally think they are not the right fit for you, then it might be time to move on.\nThis does not mean therapy will not work for you \u2013 just that this particular therapist did not. It might also not mean the therapist is a bad therapist. They all have different specialisations, personalities, styles and preferred therapeutic methods. Do not be afraid to search until you find a therapist who is right for you.\nOn the other hand, if you feel bonded with, supported and guided by your therapist but are still not seeing the progress you would like, then you should consider whether your expectations are unrealistic. \nAre you looking for quick, easy answers? Are you trying to achieve some \u201cperfect\u201d ideal? Are you applying strategies you have learned outside of therapy? And are you being honest with your therapist about what is or isn\u2019t working for you? Therapy takes time, effort, collaboration and an attainable goal.\nConsider why you\u2019re going to therapy\nIf you are attending therapy for something that is timely \u2013 to help you deal with a particular problem or difficult phase in your life \u2013 then you can finish therapy whenever you feel you have met your goal. For example, if you are going through a nasty breakup, grieving a loved one, or trying to save a relationship, then you finish therapy once you have worked through those emotions and have the tools to move forward.\nIt can be more difficult to know when to quit therapy when the problem is ongoing. Mental illness typically is not something that can be \u201cfixed\u201d or \u201ccured\u201d with treatment. The goal then is not just achieving a state of emotional or psychological wellness, but also maintaining that state.\n\nIt can help to break therapy down into two phases: the acute phase and the maintenance phase. \nThe acute phase is when you are not doing well. This includes your symptoms at their worst, and as they improve over the course of treatment. During this time, the duration, intensity and frequency of therapy is probably greater. \nOnce you have achieved a relatively stable state of wellness, you enter the maintenance phase where the goal changes to maintaining these gains you have aready made. During this phase, you probably won\u2019t need to be seen as often. \nIf you have reached this phase and are wondering whether this counts as \u201cfinishing\u201d therapy, the answer is: sort of. Try cutting back to a session once every two weeks, then once a month and so on until you are seeking therapy only as often as you need to.\nThe important thing to remember is that mental illness, and life, is full of ups and downs. If you find yourself falling back into old patterns or feeling anxious, depressed, out of control or otherwise mentally unwell, that is OK! It is not your fault. Therapy will be right there to pick you back up and get you on your way to feeling well again.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Mental health, Therapy, online therapy, Quarter Life, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Although he saw the wider commercial potential, he didn\u2019t act on the idea until he saw the entrepreneurial success of a patient of the sanitarium who produced a similar product. That patient\u2019s name was Charlie \u201cC.W.\u201d Post. \nPost couldn\u2019t afford to pay full room and board at the sanitarium, so he worked in the kitchen, gaining access to the recipes.\nAfter leaving the sanitarium, Post started his own company, Postum Cereal Company, in 1894 and brought the first ready-to-eat cold cereal to the broader market. \nPost\u2019s success led Will Kellogg to leave the sanitarium business in 1906 to found the Battle Creek Toasted Corn Flake Company, which became a direct competitor of Post. The company was renamed the Kellogg Toasted Corn Flake Company in 1909 and the Kellogg Company in 1922. \nSerendipity leads to commercial success\nWhile this history of cold cereal predates the Pop-Tart story, it demonstrates some ways in which entrepreneurial ideas come to light. \nIn the case of Kellogg\u2019s Corn Flakes, serendipity played a role. \nAlthough there are slightly different versions of the original story, the gist is that after rolling out wheat dough and forgetting it overnight, the Kellogg brothers found that the stale dough flaked easily into thin pieces that could be used to create cold cereal. Will later produced the flakes with corn, which had more crunch. \nAnother entrepreneurial lesson is that success can come simply from recognizing an opportunity.\nThe method for creating cold cereal was discovered by accident and then perfected through trial and error over time by the Kellogg brothers. C.W. Post adopted \u2013 some may say stole \u2013 the method for commercial use without needing to spend time inventing and perfecting the product. \nWhile the Kellogg brothers may have invented a healthy breakfast alternative, Post was the first to market the invention \u2013 and, thus, the first to demonstrate its commercial viability.\nThe toaster pastry race\nWhile Post may have won the cold cereal battle in the product\u2019s early days, Kellogg\u2019s was victorious in the toaster pastry competition depicted in \u201cUnfrosted.\u201d\nFollowing Post\u2019s death in 1914, his daughter, Marjorie Merriweather Post, played by Schumer in the film, took over the company when she was just 27 years old, becoming one of the first American female chief executives. The Postum Cereal Company became General Foods Corporation in 1929 after Marjorie Post made many corporate acquisitions.\nWhat happened next demonstrates that being first to market does not always create a competitive advantage. In fact, there is often what some marketing experts call a \u201csecond-mover advantage.\u201d One industry study suggests that first movers beat out late movers in just 15 of 50 product categories.\n\nThat\u2019s what we see in the story of the Pop-Tart.\nIt was Marjorie Post\u2019s announcement in February 1964 of the forthcoming \u201cCountry Squares\u201d \u2013 shelf-stable, fruit-filled pastries \u2013 that gave Kellogg\u2019s the idea to create their own version.\n\nWithin six months, and before Country Squares even hit store shelves, Kellogg\u2019s released \u201cFruit Scones.\u201d They were quickly renamed Pop-Tarts  after the era\u2019s popular Pop Art movement. \nPop-Tarts were a hit. In 1967, Kellogg\u2019s added frosting that wouldn\u2019t melt in the toaster and additional flavors to complement the original four \u2013 blueberry, strawberry, brown sugar cinnamon and apple currant.\nAs for Post\u2019s Country Squares? They became Toastem\u2019 Pop Ups in 1965, and the brand was sold in 1971 to Schulze and Burch Biscuit Co., now the largest supplier of store-brand toaster pastries in the world. \nIn a nod to this history, the Pop-Tarts website states, \u201cOthers may have attempted the art of the toaster pastry, but only one perfected it.\u201d \nWhile the first mover may have an advantage, a fast follower often wins the game in the long run.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Economy, Startups, Michigan, Breakfast cereals, Business, Cereals, Local, Entrepreurship","role":"assistant"}]}

The four suspects were purportedly aligned to the militant terrorist organisation Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).\nIS-K is an affiliate of the Islamic State militant group and seeks to create a territorially unbound caliphate. Its militants have launched violent attacks in Afghanistan, especially on ethnically Hazara Shia Muslims, as well as on high-profile targets in Iran and Pakistan. The group\u2019s deadly attacks have ensured that the term Khorasan is now globally associated with Islamist militancy. \nKhorasan is often translated from Persian as \u201cthere where the sun rises\u201d. It refers to a geographical region spanning parts of Iran, Afghanistan, and the five post-Soviet states of Central Asia. Historically, cities across the region played a pivotal in Khorasan\u2019s dynamics \u2013 culturally and politically.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why would Islamic State attack Russia and what does this mean for the terrorism threat globally?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor IS-K militants, Khorasan\u2019s symbolic power is derived from the region\u2019s importance to the emergence of one of the great Muslim dynasties, the Abbasid caliphate, in the 8th century. Yet Islamists are not the only group active in Afghanistan and the wider region to have gained inspiration from Khorasan\u2019s history in recent years.\n\nFor much of the past two decades I have conducted research in Afghanistan and among the country\u2019s diaspora in Asia, Europe and North America. I have met men and women from the country who are deeply attached to the idea of Khorasan and think it is relevant to Afghanistan\u2019s future. \nThese intellectual-activists, who are mostly Persian-speakers from north and central Afghanistan, imagine Khorasan in ways that are strikingly different from those of IS-K militants. They think of Khorasan as a historic locus of cultural and intellectual sophistication, creativity and innovation, and religious and cultural tolerance.\nThey define Khorasan\u2019s culture in relation to several key aspects. The most prominent among them is the Persian language. Persian, they argue, is the region\u2019s lingua franca and has enabled cross-cultural communication between diverse peoples over centuries. \nIn stark contrast to IS-K, they also focus on Khorasan\u2019s history of religious pluralism. This is something that manifested in the historic presence of Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, Christian and Zoroastrian populations across the region. For many of the activists, indigenous forms of Islam have nurtured religious pluralism rather than treating it as a threat. \nImagining Khorasan is, above all, an intellectual pursuit. Living in cities across Europe and North America, many of the activists organise public events where they present their ideas in speeches. And they disseminate their thoughts, mostly in Persian, in essays posted on social media and in books often published in Iran. \nPoetry is also used to express the yearning for a shared Khorasani identity for people living across the region. As one line of a popular poem goes: \u201cKabul, Kulab and Tehran, I am a Khorasani\u201d.\nBut their activities are also having an effect on the identities of people from Afghanistan. For example, a song performed by celebrated Afghan singer Sediq Shabab alongside a woman from Tajikistan concludes: \u201cwithout doubt, we are Khorasanis\u201d. \nIn Afghanistan and beyond, men and women increasingly adopt Khorasan as a pen name, and some use it to market their businesses. The sense of being Khorasani is also materialised in particular styles of women\u2019s clothing, said by those who wear them to be distinct from dresses traditionally marketed in the diaspora as \u201cAfghan\u201d.\nRelevance to Afghanistan today\nThose who see Khorasan as relevant for the future of Afghanistan are often criticised in Afghanistan and among the diaspora. They are depicted either as ethno-nationalists or as people living comfortable lives in the west more interested in romanticising the past than addressing the crises facing Afghanistan\u2019s people, including calamitous flooding connected to climate change.\nFor the activists, however, engaging with the history, culture and geography of Khorasan is of vital importance. Doing so challenges the perception of Afghanistan as a site of fundamentalist Islam and unchanging tribal customs. \nIt acts as a counterpoint to the symbolic deployment of Khorasan by IS-K, too. As a result, it carries the potential of reversing the country\u2019s cultural and political isolation. \n\nDebates about history, geography and culture are also playing a particularly prominent role in the politics of Afghanistan today. Despite the emphasis placed on \u201cnation-building\u201d during the early years of the 2001\u20132021 international intervention in Afghanistan, ethnic tensions in the country intensified. \nThen, in 2021, the Taliban returned to power. Since then, states and international organisations have been unwilling to hold the Taliban administration to account for human rights abuses, especially against women.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      The Taliban\u2019s war on women in Afghanistan must be formally recognized as gender apartheid\n\n\n\n\nAgainst this backdrop, people in Afghanistan and the diaspora calling for the establishment of an inclusive government or for greater political recognition for specific ethno-linguistic communities, have increasingly sought to frame and legitimise their ideas by referencing an imagined past.\nAttempts to imagine Afghanistan as part of an interconnected, plural and culturally vibrant region can easily be dismissed as wishful thinking. They can also be treated as an expression of divisive ethnic politics. \nBut the state of thinking about Afghanistan and the wider region is narrow and lacks ambition. Within this context, recognising the underlying desire for human dignity, cultural recognition and political visibility encapsulated by these expressions of historical imagination is more important now than ever before.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Religion, Terrorism, Afghanistan, Taliban, Culture, Central Asia, Muslim, Diaspora, Post-Soviet states, Afghanistan women, Give me perspective, Islamic State Khorasan Province","role":"assistant"}]}

How likely is this?\nAnd what do we need to think about to minimise our risk when shopping for or preparing food?\nHow safe is milk?\nBird flu (or avian influenza) is a bird disease caused by specific types of influenza virus. But the virus can also infect cows. In the US, for instance, to date more than 80 dairy herds in at least nine states have been infected with the H5N1 version of the virus. \nInvestigations are under way to confirm how this happened. But we do know infected birds can shed the virus in their saliva, nasal secretions and faeces. So bird flu can potentially contaminate animal-derived food products during processing and manufacturing. \nIndeed, fragments of bird flu genetic material (RNA) were found in cow\u2019s milk from the dairy herds associated with infected US farmers. \nHowever, the spread of bird flu among cattle, and possibly to humans, is likely to have been caused through contact with contaminated milking equipment, not the milk itself. \nThe test used to detect the virus in milk \u2013 which uses similar PCR technology to lab-based COVID tests \u2013 is also highly sensitive. This means it can detect very low levels of the bird flu RNA. But the test does not distinguish between live or inactivated virus, just that the RNA is present. So from this test alone, we cannot tell if the virus found in milk is infectious (and capable of infecting humans).\n\nDoes that mean milk is safe to drink and won\u2019t transmit bird flu? Yes and no.\nIn Australia, where bird flu has not been reported in dairy cattle, the answer is yes. It is safe to drink milk and milk products made from Australian milk.\nIn the US, the answer depends on whether the milk is pasteurised. We know pasteurisation is a common and reliable method of destroying concerning microbes, including influenza virus. Like most viruses, influenza virus (including bird flu virus) is inactivated by heat. \nAlthough there is little direct research on whether pasteurisation inactivates H5N1 in milk, we can extrapolate from what we know about heat inactivation of H5N1 in chicken and eggs.\nSo we can be confident there is no risk of bird flu transmission via pasteurised milk or milk products.\nHowever, it\u2019s another matter for unpasteurised or \u201craw\u201d US milk or milk products. A recent study showed mice fed raw milk contaminated with bird flu developed signs of illness. So to be on the safe side, it would be advisable to avoid raw milk products.\nHow about chicken?\nBird flu has caused sporadic outbreaks in wild birds and domestic poultry worldwide, including in Australia. In recent weeks, there have been three reported outbreaks in Victorian poultry farms (two with H7N3 bird flu, one with H7N9). There has been one reported outbreak in Western Australia (H9N2).\nThe strains of bird flu identified in the Victorian and Western Australia outbreaks can cause human infection, although these are rare and typically result from close contact with infected live birds or contaminated environments.\nTherefore, the chance of bird flu transmission in chicken meat is remote.\nNonetheless, it is timely to remind people to handle chicken meat with caution as many dangerous pathogens, such as Salmonella and Campylobacter, can be found on chicken carcasses. \nAlways handle chicken meat carefully when shopping, transporting it home and storing it in the kitchen. For instance, make sure no meat juices cross-contaminate other items, consider using a cool bag when transporting meat, and refrigerate or freeze the meat within two hours.\nAvoid washing your chicken before cooking to prevent the spread of disease-causing microbes around the kitchen.\nFinally, cook chicken thoroughly as viruses (including bird flu) cannot survive cooking temperatures.\n\nAre eggs safe?\nThe recent Australian outbreaks have occurred in egg-laying or mixed poultry flocks, so concerns have been raised about bird flu transmission via contaminated chicken eggs.\nCan flu viruses contaminate chicken eggs and potentially spread bird flu? It appears so. A report from 2007 said it was feasible for influenza viruses to enter through the eggshell. This is because influenza virus particles are smaller (100 nanometres) than the pores in eggshells (at least 200 nm). \nSo viruses could enter eggs and be protected from cleaning procedures designed to remove microbes from the egg surface.\nTherefore, like the advice about milk and meat, cooking eggs is best.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration recommends cooking poultry, eggs and other animal products to the proper temperature and preventing cross-contamination between raw and cooked food.\nIn a nutshell\nIf you consume pasteurised milk products and thoroughly cook your chicken and eggs, there is nothing to worry about as bird flu is inactivated by heat.\nThe real fear is that the virus will evolve into highly pathogenic versions that can be transmitted from human to human.\nThat scenario is much more frightening than any potential spread though food.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Infectious diseases, Microbiology, Chickens, Food safety, Health, Eggs, Milk, Avian flu, Virology, Viruses, Bird flu, Consumer health, Poultry farming, Egg, Raw milk, Zoonotic viruses, Poultry farms","role":"assistant"}]}

The death and destruction wrought by hyper-nationalist, authoritarian states in the first half of the 20th century still haunts the nightmares of successive generations. \nBut, as the recent European Union elections show, the fear of the far right is slipping. The political logic of earlier decades no longer holds in some quarters, and far-right parties are making gains across Europe, as their strategy of electoral engagement continues to pay off.\nViews that would have ended political careers in Europe a generation ago are now being rewarded with electoral success. Despite the lead candidate of the German far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party declaring that members of the Nazi SS were not necessarily criminals, his party climbed 5% higher to outpoll all of the parties in Germany\u2019s ruling coalition and gain six new seats in the European parliament. \nThe AfD also performed shockingly well in local elections that coincided with the European vote. With important elections coming up in the eastern states of Germany, it remains an open question whether the taboo forbidding collaboration with the far right will endure another electoral surge by the AfD.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost breathtaking was the vote in France. Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right National Rally (previously National Front) smashed President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s brittle coalition of centre-right parties. The result prompted the president to call a snap election, in what one commentator has called \u201cone of the wildest gambles in modern French history\u201d.\nMacron\u2019s call for all democratic parties to unite against the far right has already failed. One prominent centre-right politician, \u00c9ric Ciotti, declared his conservative Republican party (the party of Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy) would join National Rally in a coalition. This has set off what has been called \u201cthe wildest 72 hours in French politics\u201d in a generation. \nWhether or not the Republican party joins National Rally in this electoral cycle, an important taboo preventing democratic parties from co-operating with Le Pen has been irrevocably broken. It seems clear that, far from denying National Rally a domestic victory, Macron has created a situation in which, if last weekend\u2019s vote is repeated, he will have handed them the \u201ckeys of power\u201d.   \n\nIf Macron hopes this period will discredit National Rally before Le Pen can take the prize of the presidency, he should take a look at Italy and elsewhere in Europe, where a period of government has normalised rather than discredited the far right. \nIn the EU election, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni steered her Brothers of Italy party to first place, confirming her leading position among the European right.  While their vote was weaker than their historic highs, the bulwark parties of right-wing illiberalism in Hungary (Fidesz) and Poland (Law and Justice Party) also remain extremely powerful. \nEven outside the EU, in Britain, Nigel Farage\u2019s populist far-right Reform party has overtaken the Tories in polling for the first time. Many will be watching their result in the July 4 election with a mixture of interest and dread. \nOnly in Nordic countries did a clear turn away from the far right eventuate. In Sweden, the Social Democrats, the Left Party and the Greens together managed to secure almost 50% of the vote.    \nYouth Against Fascism? Not in 2024\nIs this rightward lurch a symptom of a generational shift towards anti-democratic, racist values in young voters? The claim has been repeatedly made, but are the young voters of Europe to blame for the rise of the right?  \nIn Germany, at least, the picture is more complex. According to Tim Gensheimer, a German researcher studying youth voting patterns, talk of a generational swing misses the point that voters between 16 and 24 were just as likely to vote left as right of centre. Generational generalisations, he insists, overlook the fact that young people are sharply divided on political matters. This is despite sharing a sense of disillusionment with major parties whose promises of a better environment, lower costs of living and a secure future have amounted to nothing. \n\nNonetheless, something has clearly changed. \nA close look at youth voting in Germany shows the real disaster was for the Greens. They promised  much in the last election and have delivered little since, leading to the loss of a massive 23% in their youth vote. \nBy comparison, the AfD and the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) picked up an additional 11% and 5% of young people\u2019s votes respectively. Although the social-democratic SPD vote stayed relatively steady among young people, it remains perilously low. \nFurther to the left, the Linke lost ground among youth voters in what was a terrible election for them. However, 6% of voters under 24  gravitated to the new populist Alliance Sahra Wagenknecht \u2013 a paleo-leftist outgrowth of the Linke stripped of its progressive green, gender and migration politics and deeply sceptical about military support for Ukraine. \nInstead of voting as a group for the far right, young Germans voted more for micro-parties than any established party. In terms of age, the group most likely to vote for the AfD were those in the 35-44 age group, particularly men who felt their economic position was precarious. \nFar more obvious than any age divide, however, was Germany\u2019s east-west divide, with the AfD polling first in all ex-East German states. Even this, however, is not the whole story, with a north-south divide also emerging. The AfD polled second to the CDU in most parts of the southern states of Bavaria and Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, while in the north-west it was most often the SPD in second position.\nThe story regarding young people was much the same in France, where the youth vote for the Greens and centrist parties collapsed, and the share of their votes to the outer left grew modestly. In comparison to other age groups, young people in France remained more likely to vote left of centre. \nNonetheless, it is clear many young French voters also took part in the broader political migration to the far right, in part thanks to the youthful star power of their leading candidate, Jordan Bardella. Through his renewal of the party\u2019s image, 32% of voters aged between 18 and 34 felt able to vote for National Rally. Macron\u2019s candidate managed a paltry 5%.\n\nElsewhere, Spain too saw a noticeable rise in the influence of the far right, with Vox collecting two more seats on the back of its anti-migrant, anti-Islam and anti-gender-politics platform. Vox has proved popular among young men, attracted by its blend of old Francoist values, like anti-liberal nationalism and ostensibly traditional family values, with newer forms of anti-migrant sentiment and climate-change denialism.  \nWhy did the far right attract so many young people?\nFor some pundits, the answer lies with the parties\u2019 tech-savvy approach, which has built up a colossal presence on Tiktok. To be sure, the use of social media to spread anti-migrant rhetoric and white supremacist idealisations of the \u201cmother-father-child\u201d family, as well as far-right talking points on Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, has clearly made inroads among a young audience whose main contact with the news comes through scrolling. \nHowever, this overlooks that young Europeans have been screaming into the void for several elections now. They have been searching for a political home that offers them some hope against a cost-of-living crisis, unaffordable housing, a collapsing ecosystem and perpetual warfare. \nIf for the most part the youth vote remains anti-status quo, this is because the trajectory of established parties appears to offer little to anyone below the age of 25. A well-founded pessimism regarding the capacity of established politics to solve real, structural problems has offered fertile soil for far-right parties peddling dangerously false solutions.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Germany, EU elections, Far-right politics, Emmanuel Macron, Rassemblement National (National Rally), Alternative for Germany (AfD)","role":"assistant"}]}

To this end, it has created a list of MPs \u2013 mainly independents but also some Workers Party of Britain and Green party candidates \u2013 to vote for in target constituencies. \nThere are 3.9 million Muslims in the UK, according to the 2021 census. Together they make up 6.5% of the population \u2013 1.2 million more than the previous census in 2011.\nTraditionally, Muslims have been electorally loyal to Labour. They have long viewed Labour as being sympathetic to the rights of ethnic minorities and the working class \u2013 groups that most Muslims, though not all, fall into. \n\n\n\n\n\nNot all Muslims vote Labour, of course, but it is nevertheless the case that most Muslims see Labour as their natural home. At the local council level, there are, according to the Labour Muslim Councillor Network, over 500 Muslim councillors across the UK \u2013 and over 75% of them are members of the Labour party. In the 2019 general election, over 80% of Muslims voted Labour. \nBut this relationship is fraying as the 2024 election approaches.

Starmer later clarified what he meant by insisting: \u201cI was saying Israel had the right to self-defence \u2026 I was not saying Israel had the right to cut off water, food, fuel or medicines.\u201d But nuanced positions rarely get coverage, of course.\nFrom interviews I have conducted with Muslim voters as part of ongoing research, it is certainly the case that many are disillusioned with the Labour party.\nEvidence from the local council, mayoral and police and crime commissioner elections across England and Wales in May this year also suggests Labour party support was down by eight points since last year in wards with Muslim populations of over 10% .  \nLabour lost control of Oldham council, an area that is 24% Muslim. The deputy leader of Manchester council, who represented Labour, also lost his seat to a representative of George Galloway\u2019s Workers Party of Britain.\n\nIn the West Midlands mayoral election, the independent pro-Gaza candidate, Akmed Yaqoob, won nearly 70,000 votes, coming in third position. He is now contesting Birmingham Ladywood, a safe Labour parliamentary seat held by shadow justice secretary Shabana Mahmood since 2010.  \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Election 2024: how many seats every party in Westminster is defending \u2013 and what they are aiming for on July 4\n\n\n\n\nThe Iraq legacy\nThe relationship between Muslims and Labour has been tested before and, just as now, foreign policy was at the heart of the matter. The 2003 war in Iraq was an important turning point in Labour-Muslim relations. A parliamentary byelection held that same year in the north-west London constituency Brent East saw the Liberal Democrats overturn a Labour parliamentary majority of 13,000. \nAt the time, the Muslim population of Brent represented over 12% of the borough \u2013 and many cited the military intervention in Iraq as their reason for switching.\nThe byelection represented a milestone. It was the first time that British Muslims had used a bloc vote at parliamentary level. This was repeated nine months later, when Muslims helped to overturn a 12,000 majority in Leicester South, handing the constituency once again to the Liberal Democrats. \nLocal elections in 2003 saw the Labour party suffer big electoral losses across the country. And in places like Birmingham, with a sizeable Muslim demographic, the party lost control over the local authority, due in part to a \u201cBaghdad backlash\u201d. \nThe extent of the backlash became clear in the 2005 general election, when the Respect party, a product of the anti-war movement, managed to field 26 candidates. One of those was Galloway, who comfortably won the seat of Bethnal Green and Bow in East London \u2013 an area where 40% of the electorate was of British Bangladeshi background and the Muslim vote was high. The seat was taken from Labour\u2019s Oona King, who had voted for military intervention in Iraq. \nIn 2024, that same constituency, with a re-configured boundary and new name \u2013 Bethnal Green and Stepney \u2013 will be targeted by an independent pro-Gaza candidate standing against Labour\u2019s Rushanara Ali. \nInitially, that independent candidate was Tasnime Akunjee, a Muslim solicitor, who has represented Shamima Begum. However, a few days before the deadline for candidate nominations in June 2024, Akunjee withdrew. He stated in a post on X that the independent movement across the country was being split by multiple people standing in one constituency and that he would step aside to make way for another candidate, Ajmal Masroor.  \nThis illustrates a pressing question for Muslim communities. If they don\u2019t vote Labour, who will they vote for? Unlike in the aftermath of the 2003 war in Iraq, when the Liberal Democrats were in large part the beneficiary of Muslims deciding to turn away from Labour, this time round, there has been a concerted effort to push independent candidates rather than an established party. \nMany independents are standing on a Gaza platform, but since there is no official party, that independent pro-Gaza Muslim vote is in danger of being split across multiple independent candidates if more than one stands in any constituency. Not all independent candidates feel so convivially towards others that they would be willing to step aside for them. \nMuslims make up over 30% of the electorate in 20 constituencies across the UK. Every one of those constituencies voted in a Labour MP in the 2019 general election. And most will probably return a Labour MP this time round, too. Labour is on course for a large majority, according to every poll. \nBut as the party marches ahead with a mantra for change, it leaves behind a cohort of voters that is deeply disillusioned. The Muslim vote will not cost the Labour party an election victory. Electorally, Labour need not be too concerned.  However, the apparent abandonment of a community of voters who have been loyal to the party for so long and who now find themselves politically homeless may be an issue that Labour may want to reflect on once the euphoria settles.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Gaza, Labour Party, UK foreign policy, Muslims UK, Muslim voters, Give me perspective, UK election 2024, Hamas-Israel war","role":"assistant"}]}

But what does that actually mean?\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia can\u2019t simply rewrite its Paris target \u2013 which Labor also legislated \u2013 to reduce it. So, is Dutton saying that a government he led would leave the Paris Agreement? \nNo, says opposition energy spokesman Ted O'Brien. \n\u201cWe are committed to Paris, the 2050 net zero target,\u201d he said at the weekend. \nBut \u201cthe 43% by 2030 is unachievable. If you look at the centrepiece of Labor\u2019s entire policy, it is 82% renewables by 2030. At best they\u2019re running at half pace. This will not happen. And the more that Labor  pretends to the Australian people and the international community, they set Australia up to fail,\u201d O'Brien said.\nClimate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen claims Australia is \u201con track\u201d to meet the target, although there\u2019s dispute about that, which is one reason gas is now being talked up by the government. \nDutton seems to be simply declaring a Coalition government would just ignore the target, paving the way to cut back Australia\u2019s efforts to meet it.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to destroy agriculture. We\u2019re not going to stifle investment. We\u2019re already seeing investment being withdrawn,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to create sovereign risk with our export partners, as Labor is doing with Japan and Korea.\u201d\nOnce again, the Nationals are to the fore in wanting to apply the handbrake on climate action \u2013 this time on the accelerated rollout of renewables and the (often unpopular) power lines that carry them. \n\u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is, let\u2019s pause and let\u2019s get this right,\u201d Nationals leader David Littleproud said. He said it was \u201ctotally false\u201d to believe failure to meet the 2030 target would \u201csee us kicked  out\u201d of the Paris agreement. \u201cWe are committed to our 2050 target.\u201d Helped, according to the Coalition, by the yet-to-be-unveiled nuclear power policy.\nSome Nationals don\u2019t like the 2050 target but the Coalition leadership  is keeping the minority party locked to it. After all, 2050 is a long time away, in political terms. And Dutton walking away noisily from  the 2030 target will help mollify the 2050 sceptics. \nOn the other hand, he will have given a fillip to the \u201cteal\u201d independents, for whom climate change ambition is a major issue. Kooyong MP Monique Ryan told the Guardian, \u201cThey\u2019re just trying to keep the door open for as long as possible for coal and gas and they\u2019ll say anything in the meantime\u201d.\nFor Dutton, winning back teal seats comes behind the priority he gives to outer suburbia and the regions (although he has visited the teal seats of North Sydney and Curtin as well as Kooyong in recent weeks).\nLeaving aside the domestic politics, vociferously rejecting a target to which Australia has committed would carry international consequences. Once again, Australia would be on the outer on climate issues. These days, with climate action written into various trade and security policies by other countries, that could carry significant economic costs, if not sovereign risk.\nThe 2030 target is not the only one on the medium term horizon. By February, the government has to produce a 2035 target. That is before the likely time for the election. It could be a challenge for Labor, especially if there is still a question mark over the pace at which we are moving to reach the 2030 commitment. \nWe can bet the house on the Coalition rejecting whatever Labor comes up with for 2035. \nLabor will be pulled in different directions. Its rhetoric, plus the need to hold votes against inroads from the Greens, will push it towards ambition. But the need to appeal to the voters in the outer suburbs, where it is competing with the Coalition, could work against being too bold. \nMost Australians want global warming tackled. But in tough times, many become more worried about the costs involved.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Energy, Nuclear power, Australia's 2030 climate target, Net-zero, Net zero emissions by 2050","role":"assistant"}]}

The 2019-2020 Black Summer was the worst in recorded history. But was that the worst it could get? \nOur new research has reconstructed the past 2,000 years of southeast Australia\u2019s bushfire weather, drawing on evidence of past climates laid down in changing patterns in deep ice in East Antarctica. The high and low pressure weather systems south of Australia are so large they connect the two continents, even though they are more than 3,000 km apart.\nThese historic weather patterns are recorded in the ice. Not with ash which might first come to mind, but in sea-salt spray from the Southern Ocean. When southeast Australia experiences extreme bushfire weather over summer, there is less wind around Antarctica, which means less sea-salt spray is laid down at the ice core site.   \nBuried in the ice is a warning. At least seven times over the last two millennia, our new research shows bushfire-prone southeast Australia has endured bushfire weather as bad or worse than what was experienced during the devastating Black Summer bushfires. The Black Summer bushfires burned through about 1.5 million hectares, or more than six times the size of the Australian Capital Territory. \nThis means natural climate variability can toss up more severe bushfire weather than we have yet seen. Given human-caused climate change is also loading the dice for worse and worse bushfire weather, it suggests we are underestimating how bad bushfires can be in Australia. \n\nWhat makes bushfire weather?\nIf the weekend is forecast to be hot, dry and windy, we would say this is bushfire weather. Bushfire weather does not mean bushfires are inevitable, only they are more likely to start and more likely to be intense and fast-spreading once they ignite. \nAustralia\u2019s Black Summer was caused by several climate factors combining. We had a multi-year drought, which coincided with climate variability bringing strong and hot northwesterly winds, and all against a backdrop of increasing heat and falling humidity over land brought by climate change.\nClimate change is bringing more frequent and more severe bushfire weather. This trend is projected to continue into the future.\nBut quantifying the impacts of climate change on bushfire weather over the southeast Australian regions hardest hit by the Black Summer bushfires is difficult. This is because the climate in these mostly coastal or alpine regions varies a lot and we only have a relatively short record of observations.  \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Antarctic ice shows Australia's drought and flood risk is worse than thought\n\n\n\n\nOur previous research on droughts \u2013 a key ingredient for extreme bushfire seasons \u2013 showed our roughly 120 years of rainfall observations does not fully cover the range of drought conditions which have occurred in the past 1,000 years. This is supported by recent palaeoclimate work reconstructing 2,000 years of eastern Australian climate variability and research using climate models to show evidence of megadroughts lasting 20 years or more in southeastern Australia. \nAustralia\u2019s bushfire weather observations only extend back to 1950. In short, this means we have limited insights based on observations alone into how bad bushfire weather can be. \nAnswers in the ice\nTo reach back further in time, we looked to Antarctica. This is because Australia and Antarctica are linked through a \u201cweather bridge\u201d, meaning the enormous, powerful weather systems of the Southern Ocean affect both at the same time. \nYear after year, these systems lift and carry different amounts of sea salt from the ocean surface and transport it to Antarctica, where it is laid down in layers of snow and ice.  \n\nAbout 125 km from Casey Station in Australia\u2019s Antarctic territory lies Law Dome. This small, coastal ice cap is very useful for climate scientists, because it is regularly hit by cold cyclones from the Southern Ocean. These intense winds bring sea salt and trigger high snow accumulation \u2013 about 1.5 metres a year.\nDrilling ice cores from places such as Law Dome has given us rich data sets of past climatic events. We have used these changing levels of sea salt in the ice to reconstruct rainfall and drought over two millennia in eastern Australia. Our new research focuses on Australia\u2019s bushfire weather.  \nWhat did we find?\nUsing this evidence, we found an important relationship between the ice core record and the Forest Fire Danger Index, used by authorities to measure bushfire weather. \nWe then grouped similar weather patterns together over time, so we could get what we were really after: the connection between high and low pressure systems in the Southern Ocean, sea salt, and bushfire weather. \nIn the observational record, most of Australia\u2019s bushfire disasters have been linked to intense summer cold fronts, including Ash Wednesday (1983), the Canberra bushfires (2003), Black Saturday (2009) and the Black Summer. These cold fronts direct hot, dry and intense winds from the Australian desert to the coast. This increases the chance of bushfires starting and can turn bushfires already burning into enormous conflagrations. \nUsing our ice core and weather datasets, we found the same weather conditions are behind periods of lower levels of sea salt in the ice and elevated bushfire weather in southeast Australia. These conditions are when the strong westerly winds circling Antarctica move north towards Australia, bringing summer cold fronts. In technical terms, this is when the Southern Annular Mode is negative. \nIn the last 2,000 years, we found seven years where bushfire weather was the same or even worse than the 2019-2020 Black Summer, in the summers of 485, 683, 709, 760, 862, 885 and 1108 CE. \n\nIce and bushfire\nClimate change is making extreme bushfire weather steadily more likely. \nWhat our research shows is that natural climate variability can also produce bushfire weather similar or worse than the Black Summer. \nFire authorities should take these possible natural extremes into account, in addition to the increasing intensity of bushfire weather from climate change. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      A 20-year 'mega-drought' in Australia?

Queues snaked around polling stations, with voters standing in line for up to six or seven hours. Some only finally cast their votes at 3am the following morning.\nHowever, the election proved at least as significant as had been predicted. Although the final votes are still being counted, it is clear that the African National Congress (ANC), which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in 1994, has suffered a major drop in support. Projections by a state research body suggest it will win just 42% of the national vote. \nThe ANC\u2019s share has declined by 15 percentage points since the last general election in 2019, when it took 57.5% of the vote. This will leave President Cyril Ramaphosa without a parliamentary majority and in need of coalition allies for the ANC to continue to govern.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Why the upcoming South African election is a massive milestone for the ruling ANC\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe party did all in its power to avert this situation. It ran an energetic campaign and mobilised its supporters across the country to go door-to-door soliciting support. Ramaphosa even used his office to deliver a contentious address on prime-time television on the eve of polling. He encouraged voters to make their voices heard in the election, then took the opportunity to highlight his government\u2019s achievements over the past five years.\nOpposition parties reacted with fury and have taken the issue to the electoral court, accusing Ramaphosa of using state resources to advance his party\u2019s interests. But this issue will only be decided long after the election is over.\nThe ANC was also assisted by the state broadcaster refusing to air a controversial political broadcast by the official opposition, the Democratic Alliance, despite being fined and ordered to do so by the regulator.\nThe ANC has had its vote eroded by the emergence of many smaller parties. The recently created uMkhonto We Sizwe party of former president Jacob Zuma has done particularly well, taking a very substantial share of the vote in Zuma\u2019s home province of KwaZulu-Natal in the country\u2019s east. \nBy noon on Thursday May 30, the ANC was privately acknowledging it could no longer control KwaZulu-Natal alone. At 6pm, it reached out to other parties to begin discussions about cooperation in the province \u2013 although Zuma\u2019s party said it would not go into coalition with the ANC.\n\nThis suggests the era of government by a single dominant party is at an end. It is a situation very few South Africans have experienced before. \nIn 1948, the National Party took power and introduced apartheid with a rigid hand. Then, after Nelson Mandela was freed from prison in 1990, the ANC swept its policies aside and has governed the country ever since. Although both governing parties occasionally took other parties into government, they did not rely upon them for control. This no longer looks to be the case.\nWhat happens next?\nThe country\u2019s system of proportional representation means that even tiny, regional parties can win some of the 400 seats in the National Assembly. The exact number will only be known when all votes have been counted. The law was changed in 2020 to allow independent candidates to stand, and this is the first time the system will have come into operation. How it works out remains to be seen.\nThe ANC will have to consider how it responds to its changed circumstances. While it will remain by a long way the largest party in government, it may be governing an unstable coalition. As South African academic and newspaper columnist Steven Friedman commented ahead of the election: \n\nDebating whether coalitions are a good idea is pointless. They are becoming the only option in more of [South Africa\u2019s] elections than ever before. They are already a fixture in local elections and could be needed in national government after this month\u2019s election.\n\nThe evidence from local government in South Africa has frequently been catastrophic. Coalitions have collapsed after the larger parties were held to ransom by their smaller partners, who demand ever-more significant positions and ever-larger shares of the budget. Several cities, including Johannesburg and Pretoria, have seen coalitions fail under these pressures. \nTo try to avoid these pitfalls, the Democratic Alliance put together a tentative coalition of \u201clike-minded\u201d opposition parties prior to the election \u2013 dubbing this proposal its \u201cMoonshot Pact\u201d. But with the Democratic Alliance only likely to win around a quarter of the votes, this looks an unlikely option.\nThis leaves South Africa facing a situation it has not experienced in a lifetime. A coalition government ruled between the two world wars, but this is hardly a guide to the current situation. \nA period of intense negotiations and possible instability looms ahead. This is not the result many voters will have hoped for as they queued under the blazing sun, or shivered in the early hours of the morning, to cast their ballots.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Africa, Elections, South Africa, Nelson Mandela, Apartheid, coalition government, The National Party, Cyril Ramaphosa, African National Congress (ANC), Keep me on trend","role":"assistant"}]}

Countries on the continent trade more with the rest of the world than they do among themselves. Africa needs to improve its share of trade to boost growth and reduce poverty.\nAid for Trade is a development initiative that seeks to remove barriers to trade facing developing countries. International trade and development economics professor Bedassa Tadesse, who recently co-wrote a paper on Aid for Trade, unpacks what the initiative is doing to solve Africa\u2019s trade problems.\nWhat\u2019s Africa\u2019s state of trade?\nDespite the continent\u2019s immense resources and untapped potential, Africa\u2019s share of global trade remains  small. It is estimated, for instance, that Africa could annually be generating US$21.9 billion more from exports to the world. This limits the continent\u2019s economic growth and ability to lift millions out of poverty. \nTrade among African nations is also low, at about 16% of the continent\u2019s total trade volume. This is much lower than intra-regional trade levels in Europe (68%) and Asia (59%).    \n\n\n\n\n\nThese statistics have serious implications. Enhancing Africa\u2019s trade within the region and globally could spark development, create jobs and reduce poverty. \nA host of challenges get in the way of Africa\u2019s trade potential. The continent faces infrastructural deficiencies, cumbersome trade regulations, and inadequate logistical support. These barriers inflate business costs and deter trade within the continent and with the rest of the world.\nWhy is trade with other nations important?\nInternational trade is a powerful tool for economic growth and consumer welfare. It allows nations to use their comparative advantages, tap into larger markets, and benefit from economies of scale. It promotes the spread of knowledge and technology across borders, stimulating innovation and productivity. By fostering cultural exchange and interdependence among nations, trade also contributes to peace and stability.  \nTo get the full benefits of trade, countries and regions need sound policies and institutional frameworks that ease global market integration and simplify trade.\nWhat\u2019s Aid for Trade, and how does it work?\nAid for Trade is an initiative that is being spearheaded by the World Trade Organisation. Launched in 2005, it\u2019s aimed at helping developing countries, particularly the least developed ones, to increase trade. The initiative has enhanced the infrastructure and trade capacity of recipient countries, increasing export performance. But there are still challenges around integrating countries  into  global markets.\nThe initiative\u2019s projects target trade-related challenges in five main areas: \n\ntrade policy and regulations: frameworks to enable smooth international trade operations \ntrade infrastructure: aid for developing roads, ports, communications and energy systems\nproductive capacity: ability to produce goods and services competitively for the global market\ntrade-related adjustment: support to manage the impacts of trade reforms and integration into the global economy, such as lower tariffs and fewer preferences.\n\nA staggering US$647.4 billion was disbursed under the initiative to 146 developing countries from 2006 to 2022. In 2022, disbursements from the initiative to developing countries reached US$51.1 billion, benefiting 178,141 projects. It\u2019s been seen to lower trade costs, increase trade volumes and create jobs in the countries involved.\nLike traditional aid, the beneficiary countries receive demand-driven funding from donors to finance their priority projects. But these must be trade-related, and the package includes technical assistance and technical cooperation. Also, unlike traditional aid, funds allocated may not always translate into direct financial inflows that support a recipient\u2019s broader development goals.\nHas it worked for Africa?\nAfrica has been the second biggest beneficiary of the Aid for Trade initiative after Asia. Under the initiative, countries on the continent received a total of US$233.18 billion from 2006 to 2022. This accounted for 36% of the total disbursements extended to all developing countries. It covered infrastructure, capacity building, policy and adjustment costs. \nGeographical and logistical challenges often inflate trade costs in Africa. That\u2019s why the initiative mostly funds projects like port facilities, trade corridors and telecommunications infrastructure across the continent.\nIn our recent analysis, we examined the initiative\u2019s impact on trade costs. We found that the initiative\u2019s trade cost reduction effects were higher among African countries with relatively good infrastructure networks. \nWhat are Africa\u2019s key success stories?\nAid for Trade projects have improved transport networks, customs procedures and trade-related institutions. \nThe success stories from Africa include: \n\nThe Busia One-Stop Border Post Project between Uganda and Kenya. The project was launched in 2010 with funding from the World Bank\u2019s East African Trade and Transport Project. It aimed to reduce the average border crossing time by 30%. The project has since cut the average time it takes to cross from Busia (Uganda) to Busia (Kenya) by 80%. The customs processing time in Busia, Kenya, is now down by 98%, while that of Busia, Uganda, has dropped by 69%.\nThe Chirundu Border Post in Zimbabwe. This pilot project was launched in 2005 with funding and technical assistance from the Japan International Co-operation Agency and the World Bank. The upgrade has enabled  faster movement of people, vehicles and goods between Zimbabwe and Zambia.\nThe East Africa Trade and Transport Facilitation Project. Launched in 2006, it aimed to improve traffic flow on the corridor linking Mombasa seaport in Kenya to Kampala (Uganda), Kigali (Rwanda), the DRC and South Sudan. It was funded by the World Bank at US$260 million, and supported by the African Development Bank, the EU, Japan, and the UK. The project has reduced transit times from Mombasa to Kampala from 15 to 5 days and cut average waiting times at Mombasa port from 19 to 13 days. \n\nThese projects are all supported by multilateral agencies and bilateral sources of Aid for Trade funding. Their success shows the initiative can lower trade barriers and enhance economic efficiency across the continent.\nWhat remains to be done?\nAfrica still faces capacity constraints. It has limited funds for research and development, low capability to negotiate trade issues, and challenges in meeting multilateral trading commitments. Market access difficulties, such as restrictive rules of origin, also continue to undermine the Aid for Trade gains. Weak institutional frameworks, infrastructure deficiencies and widespread corruption still inflate the region\u2019s trading costs. Matters are also complicated by poor regional coordination, varying regulations and conflicting standards across borders.\nWhat\u2019s needed are:\n\ninstitutional capacity\ntransparency\naccountability in aid administration\nrobust monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.\n\nThe Aid for Trade projects should also match the developmental priorities of recipient countries. \nCountries need to develop policies that create a favourable business environment. This means reducing bureaucracy, enhancing judicial independence, and protecting investor rights. \nFinally, countries should commit to regional cooperation to boost intra-African trade. This includes harmonising customs regulations and standardising trade documentation. It also means investing in continent-wide infrastructure projects that link local markets to major trade hubs.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Transport, Trade, Infrastructure, Africa, Ports, Logistics, World Bank, World Trade Organisation, Global trade, Regulations, African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), Intra-regional trade, Business costs, Intra-Africa trade","role":"assistant"}]}

Wedding Stories from Queensland.\nAs a collaborative effort by fashion designer and artist Simone Arnol (Gunggandji), artist and curator Bernard Singleton (Umpila, Djabugay\/Yirrgay) and Djunngaal Yarrabah Elders, the garment told stories about mission experiences and the colonial wedding practices within it.\nBased on mission-style wedding dresses, the gown featured a five-metre-long circle train embedded with a powerful image of a mission imprisonment. The stained lining from traditional materials represented the suppression of First Nations culture. \n\nHealing through art garments\nArtist Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha\/Nukunu) created a piece about the experiences of her grandmother Fanny and great-great-grandmother Florey as domestic servants in the early 1900s. \nThe work features two linen aprons, depicting those worn by Flora and Fanny, and 16 hand-blown glass bush plums placed inside and poking through the pockets. Their names were also carefully hand stitched onto each apron.\nThe piece represents the strength of Flora and Fanny in their roles as matriarchs caring for family and holding onto their cultural identity. \n\nShellworked Slippers by Esme Timbery (Bidjigal) contains 200 pairs of tiny, adorned shoes to represent the children of the Stolen Generation and the shell craft practice of Aboriginal women at La Perouse, Sydney.\nMade from fabric and encrusted with glitter and shells of various sizes, colours and designs, the slippers speak to the experiences of the children who were forcibly removed and the strength and resilience of First Nations families and communities. \nWhile not a uniform of children who were removed and placed in institutions, the large quantity of small and empty shoes reminds the viewer of the suffering and trauma experienced under the Protectionist policies.\n\nSharing stories, remembering history\nFirst Nations fashion designers and artists are transforming Protectionist-era fashions on the runway and in exhibitions. In doing this, they aim to speak back to racist and colonial policies and heal. \nWe need to keep sharing these stories about the true history of this country and how garments repressed and controlled First Nations people. \nThe movement toward healing painful memories and intergenerational trauma through garments positively contributes to First Nations people\u2019s wellbeing.\nFirst Nations peoples are resistant and, through clothing, will continue to explore and celebrate culture and identity.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Fashion, Sorry Day, Stolen Generations, First Nations art, First Nations fashion, Visual art and design","role":"assistant"}]}

Now what? With the sheer amount of confusing exercise advice out there, it can be hard to decide what to include in a weights routine.\nIt can help to know there are broadly two types of movements in resistance training (lifting weights): compound exercises and isolation exercises.\nSo what\u2019s the difference? And what\u2019s all this got to do with strength, speed and healthy ageing?\nWhat\u2019s the difference?\nCompound exercises involve multiple joints and muscle groups working together. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn a push up, for example, your shoulder and elbow joints are moving together. This targets the muscles in the chest, shoulder and triceps.\nWhen you do a squat, you\u2019re using your thigh and butt muscles, your back, and even the muscles in your core.\nIt can help to think about compound movements by grouping them by primary movement patterns. \nFor example, some lower body compound exercises follow a \u201csquat pattern\u201d. Examples include bodyweight squats, weighted squats, lunges and split squats.\n\nWe also have \u201chinge patterns\u201d, where you hinge from a point on your body (such as the hips). Examples include deadlifts, hip thrusts and kettle bell swings.\nUpper body compounded exercises can be grouped into \u201cpush patterns\u201d (such as vertical barbell lifts) or \u201cpull patterns\u201d (such as weighted rows, chin ups or lat pull downs, which is where you use a pulley system machine to lift weights by pulling a bar downwards).\nIn contrast, isolation exercises are movements that occur at a single joint. \nFor instance, bicep curls only require movement at the elbow joint and work your bicep muscles. Tricep extensions and lateral raises are other examples of isolation exercises.\n\nCompound exercises can make daily life easier\nMany compound exercises mimic movements we do every day. \nHinge patterns mimic picking something off the floor. A vertical press mimics putting a heavy box on a high shelf. A squat mimics standing up from the couch or getting on and off the toilet. \nThat might sound ridiculous to a young, fit person (\u201cwhy would I need to practise getting on and off a toilet?\u201d). \nUnfortunately, we lose strength and muscle mass as we age. Men lose about 5% of their muscle mass per decade, while for women the figure is about 4% per decade.\nWhen this decline begins can vary widely. However, approximately 30% of an adult\u2019s peak muscle mass is lost by the time they are 80.\nThe good news is resistance training can counteract these age-related changes in muscle size and strength.  \nSo building strength through compound exercise movements may help make daily life feel a bit easier. In fact, our ability to perform compound movements are a good indicator how well we can function as we age.\n\nWhat about strength and athletic ability?\nCompound exercises use multiple joints, so you can generally lift heavier weights than you could with isolation exercises. Lifting a heavier weight means you can build muscle strength more efficiently.\nOne study divided a group of 36 people into two. Three times a week, one group performed isolation exercises, while the other group did compound exercises. \nAfter eight weeks, both groups had lost fat. But the compound exercises group saw much better results on measures of cardiovascular fitness, bench press strength, knee extension strength, and squat strength.\nIf you play a sport, compound movements can also help boost athletic ability. \nSquat patterns require your hip, knee, and ankle to extend at the same time (also known as triple extension).\nOur bodies use this triple extension trick when we run, sprint, jump or change direction quickly. In fact, research has found squat strength is strongly linked to being able to sprint faster and jump higher. \nIsolation exercises are still good\nWhat if you\u2019re unable to do compound movements, or you just don\u2019t want to? \nDon\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll still build strength and muscle with isolation exercises.\nIsolation exercises are also typically easier to learn as there is no skill required. They are an easy and low risk way to add extra exercise at the end of the workout, where you might otherwise be too tired to do more compound exercises safely and with correct form.\nIn fact, both isolation and compound exercises seem to be equally effective in helping us lose body fat and increase fat-free muscle mass  when total intensity and volume of exercises are otherwise equal.\nSome people also do isolation exercises when they want to build up a particular muscle group for a certain sport or for a bodybuilding competition, for example.\n\nI just want a time efficient workout\nConsidering the above factors, you could consider prioritising compound exercises if you\u2019re:\n\ntime poor\nkeen to lift heavier weights\nlooking for an efficient way to train many muscles in the one workout\ninterested in healthy ageing.\n\nThat said, most well designed workout programs will include both compound and isolation movements. \n\nCorrection: This article has been amended to reflect the fact a weighted row is a pull pattern, not a push pattern.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Exercise, Gym, Exercising, lifting weights, Weightlifting, Sports training, Working out, Resistance exercise, Exercise science, Weights","role":"assistant"}]}

Driven by a heightened awareness of the vital role of pollinators and the practice\u2019s increasing recognition, more Canadians than ever are looking to suit up and keep their own bees \u2014 and not just rural Canadians. \nPollinators appear to be well-suited for the urban landscape. Cities shield them from many agricultural pesticides and predators, offer a wide diversity of vegetation and extend the pollination season by providing warmer ground temperatures. However, despite these potential advantages, honeybee populations have not always fared well in cities.\nIn a recent study we found a 26 per cent beehive mortality rate in Toronto, surpassing the rates observed in the province of Ontario (17.8 per cent) and Canada as a whole (23.2 per cent) for the same year. This trend appears to be consistent across cities in Canada, where urban beekeepers reported above-average hive mortality rates.\nAs specialists in urban environment, we sought to understand why honeybees may be experiencing a higher hive mortality rate in cities than their rural counterparts. Our study used data \u2014 provided by urban beekeeping company Alv\u00e9ole \u2014 from 3,697 honeybee hives between 2017 and 2022 in Montr\u00e9al and Toronto to assess the effect of urban and environmental factors on hive survival. \n\n\n\n\n\nOur results can tell us much about how to design urban environments in Canada which are healthier for both bees and humans alike.\nChallenges to survival\nOur analysis identified four key factors that influence the likelihood of honeybee hive survival in Canadian cities.\nFirst, hives require a density of flowering vegetation nearby in order to survive. To improve foraging opportunities, planners should prioritize strategies aimed at enhancing urban vegetation. By integrating vegetation planning into urban development strategies, cities can cultivate biodiverse environments that are conducive to pollinators and contribute to the overall urban environment. \nSecond, our research corroborates the detrimental effect of air pollution on honeybee health. We found that even minimal levels of exposure to air pollutants \u2014 such as ozone \u2014 in cities may significantly compromise hive survival. This underscores the necessity for urban air quality objectives to encompass not only human health and carbon emissions but also the ecological well-being of pollinators and all non-humans. \nAn effective initiative to mitigate the impact of air pollution on pollinators is the creation of urban green space corridors, such as the Darlington corridor in Montr\u00e9al.\n\nThird, we show that above a certain threshold, the more hives there are in a given area, the lower the chances of survival each hive will have. This concern is heightened as studies have demonstrated how the introduction of western honeybees may negatively impact native pollinators through foraging competition.\nTo reduce resource competition, policymakers should consider imposing limits on the number of hives. However, much more research is needed to determine specific carrying capacities and establish whether implementing a city- or neighbourhood-wide hive limit could effectively ensure the health and survival of honeybees. \nPolicymakers should also seek to mandate that new vegetation be planted alongside new hives both to reduce the risk of resource competition and benefit human populations through mitigating climate change and alleviating heat islands.\nFinally, we observed a clear correlation between honeybee survival rates and the overall level of urban environmental policies within each city. \nFor example, the noticeably better performance of hives in Toronto may be due to efforts from the city and province to ban cosmetic (non-agricultural) pesticides compared to Montr\u00e9al, which only moved to ban pesticides in 2022. Additionally, our data allows us to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which seems to have had a positive effect on honeybee hive health in both cities \u2014 likely as a result of lower levels of air pollution from decreased vehicle traffic. \n\nThe pandemic\u2019s positive effect could also be attributed to initiatives aimed at embellishing public spaces, such as parks and the public right-of-way, to promote safe outdoor activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTaking action\nOur findings highlight the need for urban planners to consider neighbourhood-scale environmental factors to help ensure the survival of urban honeybee hives. \nMoves to implement cleaner forms of transportation are essential along with efforts to enhance urban biodiversity by prohibiting pesticide use and encouraging the planting of bee-friendly plant species through subsidies and educational initiatives.\nOur findings regarding the health of honeybee hives underscores the importance of integrating environmental considerations into urban planning to create cities which are healthy and liveable for both humans and our apine friends.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Conservation, Public health, Urban, Climate, Bees, Beekeeping","role":"assistant"}]}

How can historians meet the political demands of this moment without oversimplifying their research or tailoring their conclusions to respond to current legal arguments \u2013 skewing their analysis in the process?\n\nMeeting the moment\nAs a historian of 19th-century U.S. history and a program manager in the Office of Public Scholarship and Engagement at the University of California, Davis, I find the public demand for historians\u2019 takes on these issues intriguing and exciting. \nYet this \u201chistory-for-hire\u201d approach can complicate the incentives of historical inquiry. \nFor decades, historians have been writing amicus briefs, also known as \u201cfriend of the court\u201d briefs, which are advisory documents submitted to the court by outside parties. \nBut the emphasis of this court on deciding cases by interpreting the original meaning of the Constitution, including recently relying on the original intent of the Second Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment, has brought more historians out of the shadows \u2013 and archives \u2013 to publicly contribute to the debates. \nSome historians are getting broad media coverage, including Harvard scholar Jill Lepore and Yale scholar David Blight. They could be heard in a Jan. 31, 2024, interview on NPR highlighting their friend-of-the-court brief  in the case that challenged Donald Trump\u2019s presence on the Colorado ballot because he had engaged in insurrection. Lepore and Blight used their amicus brief to delve into the historical intent of Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nContributing to the public discussion is part of the role of historians and arguably maintains their field\u2019s relevance. The American Historical Association, the leading professional organization for historians, offers advocacy tips on its website that provide strategies for weighing in on public issues. \nBut when advocacy comes to mean applying historical research methods to high-stakes legal decisions, some historians can feel like they are venturing outside of their field and into the less familiar realm of legal argument.\nComplicating the history\nGregory Downs, department chair and professor of history at the University of California, Davis, and a recent appointee to the Brennan Center\u2019s Historians Council on the Constitution, says that historians\u2019 methods can sometimes feel out of step with the methods and operations of the court. \nWhile historians contextualize history to better understand the many differences between eras of the past, lawyers look for direct analogies between the past and present that can help illuminate their case. This can lead to oversimplifications. As Downs puts it, \u201cAny argument that makes a direct analogy between a present moment and 1866 is inherently ahistorical.\u201d\nIn addition, while historians approach a historical question without a preconceived conclusion, lawyers approach a case knowing they are supporting one side or the other. \nThe very avenues available for historians to contribute to these legal debates \u2013 amicus briefs \u2013 already shape historians\u2019 argument into a series of responses to the legal questions of the case, instead of allowing for an open historical inquiry. While it is possible for a scholar to submit an amicus brief in support of neither side in a case, in general, historians are asked to provide historical reinforcement for only one side in these cases. \nAs Downs says: \u201cAmicus briefs start from a premise that they are supporting one side or another \u2026 the court\u2019s eventually going to have to decide.\u201d At the Supreme Court, he says, \u201cThey are upholding or overturning a prior ruling, so they are in a binary outcome, and this is why the briefs can end up with a binary outcome.\u201d \nThis approach stands contrary to historians\u2019 impulse to highlight the complexity in history. Historians have a difficult time narrowing the many events and perspectives of history down to one side or the other.\n\nInstead, historians\u2019 strengths lie in placing historical records in context and using historical events or individuals as a starting point to tell a coherent story of the past. These stories can evolve, expand or shift as new evidence and perspectives are uncovered and integrated into historical narratives. \nThe aim of historical research is not to convince a present-day jury or judge of a specific predetermined conclusion, but rather to collect evidence, explore diverse interpretations and challenge unprovable narratives about the past. \nAs Downs says, \u201cThe balancing act for historians is, how do we stay as true as we can\u201d to these complexities and also \u201cfigure out if there is enough applicability \u2013 in our subjective judgment \u2013 to write a brief that still aims to be useful.\u201d \n\u201cYou could write a brief that says \u2018everything is very complicated,\u2019\u201d he says, \u201cbut then there is no utility.\u201d\nMaking the case\nThe current court majority champions the notion that the original intent of the Constitution should be conclusive in settling the pressing legal issues of today. \nYet historians see not just one intent in that document, but many \u201cintents\u201d expressed \u2013 and suppressed \u2013 throughout American society during the drafting of the Constitution and its amendments.\nWhich intent to settle on as authoritative is usually a political or judicial question, not a question asked by historians. The inherent complexity of history can undermine the search for clear and decisive jurisprudence.\nFurthermore, in recent decades, history as a discipline has expanded its focus to include voices that were traditionally left out of authoritative histories. These include the voices of people of color and women, who were barred from providing input into the drafting of the Constitution. How should a court take into consideration the expansion of historical perspectives? \nPerhaps because of this difficulty in parsing the most appropriate historical perspective to apply to a legal case, sometimes the historical narratives are simply overlooked by the Supreme Court. \nThis happened in the March 2024 decision in the case that determined Trump\u2019s inclusion on the Colorado ballot. \nDespite multiple amicus briefs submitted by historians who found historical evidence to justify removing Trump from the Colorado ballot under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, the justices\u2019 unanimous opinion did not reference this historical context. History was largely ignored, as were the historians. \nAs originalism retains its influence in the Supreme Court, historians will likely continue to explore new opportunities to contribute to court cases. Historians are trying to meet this moment, but questions remain whether their research will be found useful in the adversarial environment of courts, and whether their analyses will have a meaningful effect on court decisions.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Abortion, US Supreme Court, US history, US Constitution, Originalism, Gun rights, Historians","role":"assistant"}]}

Trust and confidence in how Britain is governed is as low as it has ever been \u2013 just as it was shortly before the last election five years ago.\nYet the circumstances that have given rise to the public\u2019s pessimistic outlook this time are very different from 2019.\nIn the weeks and months leading up to the last election, voters\u2019 confidence in politics and politicians was shaken by parliament\u2019s apparent inability to decide the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU.\nNow, according to the latest British social attitudes (BSA) report from the National Centre for Social Research, the public mood has darkened further. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2019, 34% said they \u201calmost never\u201d trusted \u201cBritish governments of any party to put the needs of the country above the interests of their own political party\u201d. Now, as many as 45% express that view \u2013 a record high in response to a question that has been asked regularly over the past 30 years.\nMeanwhile, in 2019, 79% said that the system of governing Britain was in need of \u201cquite a lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d of improvement. This represented a record high for a question first asked 50 years ago when the country was facing a worsening inflationary spiral and serious industrial unrest. Despite those difficulties, in 1973, only 49% reckoned at that time that there was a need for significant improvement.\nNow, according to the latest BSA, once again, 79% say that \u201cquite a lot\u201d or \u201ca great deal\u201d of improvement is required.\nA consequence of this decline in trust and confidence appears to have been an increased appetite for re-examining some of Britain\u2019s constitutional rules. A record 53% say that we should change the voting system used to elect the House of Commons so that smaller political parties \u201cget a fair share of MPs\u201d.\nJust under half (49%), more than at any point in the last 25 years, now support some form of devolution for England, either through regional assemblies or an English parliament. In both cases, support is markedly higher among those with low levels of trust and confidence.\nFrom Brexit bounce to leavers\u2019 remorse\nAfter the 2019 election, there were signs of improvement in levels of trust and confidence. The proportion looking for substantial improvement in how the country is governed\nfell in 2020 to 61%, while just 23% said they almost never trusted governments.\nBut this fall occurred almost entirely among just one half of the population \u2013 those who had voted leave in the 2016 Brexit referendum.\nThe proportion of leavers who felt the country\u2019s system of government needed a great deal of improvement fell sharply from 81% in 2019 to 54% in 2020. Similarly, the proportion who said they almost never trusted the government dropped from 40% to 25%. The success (from their point of view) of Brexit had seemingly given them renewed faith in how they were being governed. In contrast, there was barely any movement among those who had voted remain.\n\nHowever, Brexit is not as popular now as it was five years ago. The latest opinion polls suggest that, on average, three in five people might vote to rejoin the EU. As many as 71% think the economy is worse off as a result of leaving the EU, while 48% feel immigration to the UK is higher as a result of the decision. Even around a half of those who voted leave concur with those views.\nLeavers\u2019 apparent disappointment with what has happened since the UK left the EU has been accompanied by a reversal of the decline in low trust and confidence that had been in evidence in 2020.\nNow, as many as 76% believe that Britain\u2019s system of government needs a lot of improvement, only slightly below the 81% who expressed that view in 2019. At the same time, 48% almost never trust governments to prioritise the nation\u2019s needs, slightly above the 40% who felt that way in 2019.\nPoor services, low trust\nIt is not just unhappiness with Brexit that has occasioned the fall in trust and confidence. Levels of dissatisfaction with the NHS are at a record high. And those who are unhappy about the state of the health service are markedly less happy with how Britain is being governed.\nAs many as 86% of those who are dissatisfied with the NHS say the system of government needs improvement, while 52% almost never trust governments. The equivalent figures among those who are satisfied are 65% and 32%, respectively.\nUnsurprisingly, more people now say they are struggling with their income than was the case before 2019. And those in that position have lower trust and confidence, too. As many as 57% say they never trust the government, while 85% believe Britain\u2019s system of government could be improved a lot.\nAnd while it is impossible to show directly, doubtless the political turmoil that has surrounded the fall of two prime ministers may well have served to undermine trust and confidence too.\nThe challenge facing the next government will not only be to repair the damage that the pandemic, inflation and war have all inflicted on the economy. It will also be to assuage the widespread concern that the public once again have about how they are being governed.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"UK politics, Electoral reform, Trust, NHS, Devolution, Public opinion, Election 2024, Give me perspective, UK election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

For every passenger car sold in Australia, almost three SUVs are sold.\nVehicles such as pickup trucks, large utes, minivans and SUVs tend to offer more protection to their occupants than smaller cars. This is largely due to their larger mass and the way their structures are designed to absorb impact. For the drivers and passengers, this can mean a lower risk of injury in multi-vehicle collisions.\nBut those same attributes increase the risks to occupants of smaller vehicles, pedestrians and cyclists. The height of the large vehicle\u2019s front end can intrude into the passenger compartment of a smaller vehicle and its greater mass can lead to more forceful impacts.\nThe invincibility perception\nSurveys show drivers believe larger vehicles are safer. This has a major influence on deciding which car to buy (among other factors such as prestige and off-road capabilities). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe perception of safety could potentially lower a driver\u2019s sense of risk aversion, leading to riskier driving behaviours, such as adopting less cautious hand positions  on the steering wheel. SUV drivers more frequently drive with one hand (as opposed to a \u201c10-2 o\u2019clock\u201d hand position), suggesting they feel safer than other car drivers. \nImpact on collisions\nA study from the Netherlands found a significant increase in fatality risk with heavier vehicles. \nThis has also been seen in the United States, where a study found a 500 kilogram increase in vehicle weight, which could mean the difference between an SUV and a sedan, correlated with a 70% higher fatality risk.\n\nThe 2003 bumper height-matching standard aimed to reduce the severity of crashes between SUVs\/pickup trucks and cars. By aligning the bumper heights of these vehicles, their bumpers would engage properly during a collision, improving the crash force distribution and better protecting occupants.\nBut it has had mixed results. It modestly decreased death risks in side-collisions but was less effective in head-on crashes. This suggests further safety improvements are needed to address vehicle-to-vehicle collision impacts effectively.\nThe likelihood of SUVs causing fatalities to drivers in other cars reduced from being 132% more likely for a collision with an SUV in the early 90s, to 28% more likely by 2016. Likely reasons for the decrease include implementation of the bumper height-matching standard, as well as improvements in vehicle design: the implementation of crumple zones, better side-impact protection and advanced safety features such as electronic stability control.\nHowever, we haven\u2019t seen similar improvements with pickup trucks, suggesting weight is a possible cause of the increased risk of fatalities. \nWhat about pedestrians and cyclists?\nPedestrians are more likely to suffer fatal injuries in a collision with a large vehicle than a passenger car. \nThe design of these vehicles, particularly their higher front-ends, significantly elevates the risk. A mere 10 centimetre increase in front-end height can elevate the risk of pedestrian death by 22%, with impacts more likely occurring at critical injury points like the chest or head.\n\nStudies have shown a correlation between the surge in larger vehicle sales, such as SUVs, and an increase in pedestrian fatalities in the United States between 2000 and 2019. Children are eight times more likely to die when struck by an SUV compared to lighter and smaller cars. \nResearchers estimate that substituting larger vehicles with smaller cars in 2019 could have prevented around 460 US pedestrian fatalities that year alone. \nComputer simulations have examined the impact of car accidents on the human brain of pedestrians, comparing the effects of being struck by an SUV versus a sedan. SUVs exert twice as much force on the brain as sedans when moving at equivalent speeds, significantly increasing the risk of severe injuries, even before direct head contact occurs. \nComputer simulations have also shown that high-front vehicles cause pedestrians to hit the ground at higher speeds.\nCyclist injuries from SUV-related crashes have also been found to be notably more severe than those from car-related crashes, with a particular increase in the severity of head injuries for collisions involving SUVs. \nThis difference in injury severity is attributed to the design of SUVs, which are more likely to cause cyclists to hit the ground or to inflict injury.\nImpact on driveway collisions\nLarge vehicles increase the risk of driveway accidents, particularly involving children aged under five, as their design often limits rear visibility.\nAn eight-year study from Utah identified 495 vehicle-pedestrian injuries, with 128 occurring in driveways. These accidents disproportionately involved larger vehicles such as SUVs, trucks and vans, due to their extensive blind spots.\nThe \u201cSpot the Tot\u201d public awareness campaign and similar initiatives aim to combat these incidents by promoting safety practices such as visual checks behind the vehicle before moving.\n\nThe emergence and adoption of technologies such as backup cameras and parking sensors has markedly improved visibility, reducing blind zones by around 90%. \nDespite these advances, the need for heightened driver awareness and precaution remains critical.\nStopping the vehicle arms race\nWith more and more drivers opting for larger vehicles under the guise of personal safety, they may inadvertently compromise the safety of pedestrians and other road users. For every fatal accident avoided by someone inside a large vehicle, there are at least 4.3 additional fatal accidents involving others.\nChanging the trend towards bigger cars requires strong policy and (dis)incentives. \nThere\u2019s currently a discussion about imposing heavier taxes and\/or registration fees on SUVs and larger cars, particularly for their safety implications on others. \nIn some places, such as Paris, heavier vehicles are discouraged by tripling parking rates for cars over a certain weight. \nBut given the popularity of large vehicles, such policy change won\u2019t be easy.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Cars, Injury, Health policy, Road safety, Bicycling, Trauma, Health, Accident, Road trauma, SUVs, Accidents","role":"assistant"}]}

Instead, they should make a choice informed by their strategy. In short, when it comes to AI and service firms, more isn\u2019t necessarily better.\nWhy service providers face a different calculation\nAre you a manufacturer? Then if AI reduces your costs without lowering quality and gives you the return on investment you need, go ahead and try it.\nBut service businesses \u2013 firms that do things for customers, rather than making physical products \u2013 are different.

Customers can complicate something as simple as ordering pie.\n\n\n\n\n\nDealing with customers introduces what academics call customer interaction uncertainty. That uncertainty comes from two sources: the extent of interaction with customers, and \u2013 because customers may want a lot of different things \u2013 a potentially wide range of offerings.\nAs an example, consider a restaurant. A customer orders what they want, combines different dishes as they see fit, and then eats the food when it comes out. The customer might make bad decisions, but the restaurant is stuck with them. \nIf you let the customer interact with a server \u2013 or, even worse, the cook \u2013 they may ask for substitutes, question the ingredients or try to convince you to make something special. None of that will happen if you confine them to choosing from a set menu via a tablet. To continue the analogy, a restaurant can offer a small number of standard dishes, or it can offer many dishes the customer can customize. \nIf you run a service business, you\u2019ve already made any number of choices based on your customer interaction strategy. Imagine, for example, you run a financial services firm. Are your offices comfortable and convenient for your customers, designed for long meetings to go over their needs? Or do you restrict your time with your customers and work with them over the phone or even an app? \nSimilarly, do you limit your offerings so that you know pretty much what you\u2019ll be doing for each customer? Or do your services vary widely depending on the customer\u2019s needs and the choices they make? Think, for example, of CPAs versus tax preparation apps.\nDoing business in an uncertain world\nHow much uncertainty do you allow your customer to introduce into your production process? This should be one of the main things guiding whether your service business adopts AI.\nTo understand why, let\u2019s take a detour into what academics call information processing theory. According to this body of work, organizations cope with uncertainty by using knowledge to reduce risk. The core challenge for service firms is deploying knowledge in service production.\nIndividual knowledge \u2013 also known as human capital \u2013 reduces uncertainty in service production as human workers solve problems and meet customer needs. But human capital has its problems: It belongs to the employee and not to the firm, and it\u2019s not scalable. On the plus side, customers still value human interaction.\nThe other form of knowledge is known as \u201corganizational capital\u201d: codified knowledge that the firm itself owns. Organizational capital has inherent advatages: It belongs to the firm, and it scales. AI, a form of organizational capital, clearly has these advantages.\nInformation processing theory gives us three techniques for organizing knowledge to deal with uncertainty.\nThe first is having rules and programs \u2013 a form of organizational capital. The second is having hierarchical structures. Here, front-line workers escalate intricate matters to more knowledgeable managers. The third is goal-oriented coordination: Businesses can deal with uncertainty by empowering lower-tier employees with decision-making autonomy, guided by overarching organizational objectives. These last two rely on knowledgeable, experienced workers \u2013 human capital. \nHere\u2019s how that fits with service strategy. Mostly, firms with fewer options for consumers and limited customer interaction use organizational capital. Nowadays, that typically means tech solutions on top of rules and programs. Firms with a wide range of offerings but limited customer interaction use a hierarchy, where challenges get passed up the chain. And firms with both a wide range of offerings and high customer interaction use front-line knowledge workers coordinated by targets or goals. \nTech may augment the latter two modes, but the cost of offering a wider range of services or greater customer choice is that the firm becomes more dependent on human knowledge workers.\nThe strategic use of AI\nAI, a sophisticated form of organizational capital, can reduce customer interaction uncertainty. The firm owns it and can scale it. Yet it is still bound by its rules and dataset, and there are areas of uncertainty where human capital still offers advantages: finding creative solutions, linking disparate concepts and understanding the nuances of human interaction, to name a few. \nThe challenge is to strategically navigate all of this, combining customer strategy and human and organizational capital in a cohesive way. We came up with four rules that should help:\n\nStrike a strategic balance. For predictable tasks, such as payments, automation enhances efficiency and sacrifices little. Complex and varied customer needs, however, demand the flexibility and empathy of human expertise and interaction. The optimal approach often lies in a balanced integration of both, where automation supports routine tasks and humans take care of those nuances that automation can\u2019t handle.  \nLeverage strengths. Use AI to navigate tasks such as data analysis and decision-making processes where objectivity and comprehensiveness are crucial. This ensures precision and reliability in services where mistakes can have big consequences, such as finance and health care. On the other hand, in services where trust, personal rapport and reputation are vital, prioritize human interaction to build and maintain strong client relationships.\nSeek opportunities for synergy. Encourage dynamic interaction  between human capabilities and AI technologies, so each can learn from the other. This not only enhances current operations but also fosters an environment where both humans and AI can evolve. This can lead to a sustainable competitive advantage over rivals by continuously expanding the firm\u2019s knowledge base and adaptability.\nConsider the context. Assess the specific needs and values of your customers to determine the appropriate mix of human and technological resources. Recognize that this balance may shift over time as technologies advance and client expectations change.\n\nBy following these guidelines, service firms can navigate the complexities of integrating AI into their operations, leveraging the best of all worlds to meet their clients\u2019 needs effectively and sustainably.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Artificial intelligence (AI), Economy, Management, Efficiency, Strategy, Technology, Automation, Uncertainty, Business investment, small businesses, Customers, Businesses, Management theory","role":"assistant"}]}

One of the fastest-growing economies in the world, Indonesia has long been powered by coal. Now, it\u2019s endeavouring to go green through renewables, grid modernisation, electric vehicles and geothermal. \nThat\u2019s where Australia comes in. In March this year, the two nations formalised a climate partnership, named KINETIK. Through the agreement, Indonesia will secure supplies of lithium for EV batteries, and Australia will gain more export markets for its critical minerals, as well as potential access to the batteries\u2019 industry supply chain.\n\nWhy has the relationship been rocky?\nSince winning independence from the Dutch, Indonesia has focused heavily on keeping its many islands and ethnic groups united. \nBut Australia\u2019s role has sometimes been destabilising. During the Cold War, Australian agencies backed the Indonesian army\u2019s bloody purges of communists. \nAustralia also backed the cause of East Timorese secession. In 1998, Australian Prime Minister John Howard wrote to Indonesia\u2019s President, B.J Habibie, pushing for East Timorese independence. A year later, over 5,500 Australian soldiers arrived as peacekeepers during a tense referendum over the region\u2019s future. \n\nMany people in Indonesia saw Australia\u2019s involvement as a threat to national unity and cohesion. Before Howard and Indonesia\u2019s next president, Megawati Soekarnoputri, had time to restore the relationship, tensions ramped up again after the 2002 terrorist bombings in Bali which killed 88 Australians. \nFour years later, the Australian decision to grant temporary protection visas to 43 asylum seekers from Papua, which has long sought independence from Indonesia, led Indonesia\u2019s ambassador to Canberra to be recalled. \nThis diplomatic incident bore positive fruit, resulting in improved dialogue and, the same year, the signing of the Lombok Treaty, in which both countries promised not to interfere with the sovereignty of the other. \nSince then, Australia has been diplomatically silent on other Indonesian territorial issues, such as the separatist movement in Papua. \nDespite these efforts, many differences remain. Experts have often warned the relationship is tenuous. \nIn 2019, the two nations signed a new Comprehensive Economic Partnership after a tortuous negotiation period. With a focus on climate change and energy transition, this paved the way for this year\u2019s announcement. \nIn a broader context, this partnership also illustrates Australia\u2019s approach as a middle power nation to counterbalance China\u2019s increasing economic dominance in the Indo-Pacific region.\nCould the green transition help the relationship?\nIn 2022, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Indonesia, where he promised A$200 million to kickstart climate and infrastructure projects. \n\nNow we have a formalised partnership. This is an important step, which should improve the political relationship. \nThe two nations already trade $18 billion of goods and services yearly, centred on Australian coal and beef and Indonesian fertilisers and petrol.  \nBut there is room for much more growth. Indonesia\u2019s population is young and large, with almost 280 million people. By 2030, estimates suggest it could be the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy. \nIf the KINETIK partnership works, it will be because it offers both nations what they need \u2013 Australia gets a new export market for green minerals, technology and know-how, and Indonesia starts to shift away from coal.  \nThe agreement builds on a memorandum of understanding on electric vehicles and another between Export Finance Australia and Indonesia\u2019s State-owned Electricity Company last year. \nWhat are we likely to see as tangible outcomes?\nIndonesia perches on the Pacific Ring of Fire, with a number of active volcanoes and frequent earthquakes. This also means the archipelago nation has huge geothermal resources, estimated at 40% of the world\u2019s total. Many geothermal plants are already running. \nBut making the most of the resource faces many technological challenges. The best underground heat resources tend to be located in mountains or in isolated areas. The KINETIK partnership could help through connecting Australian mining expertise to Indonesia\u2019s deep heat resources. \nAustralia\u2019s expertise in using renewables to power isolated communities will be vital to make exploration easier. And Australian investors will be allowed to own a majority share of Indonesian geothermal plants.  \n\nThe partnerships are expected to align with Indonesia\u2019s National Energy Policy, which aims in part to shift from exporting raw energy resources and critical minerals to exporting value-added energy products through downstream projects such as EV and battery industries.\nAustralia is home to the world\u2019s largest hard-rock lithium mine, Greenbushes. The new partnership will open up options for Indonesian battery manufacturers to access this key metal. \nIndonesia, in turn, is rich in nickel, which will be needed in great quantities for green technologies. In fact, cheaper Indonesian nickel has pushed some Australian producers out of the market. Indonesia has already secured commercial deals with EV and battery manufacturers such as Hyundai and LG from South Korea, as well as Foxconn from Taiwan. \nWill this be enough?\nPolitically, the relationship between Indonesia and Australia has long been thorny. A new focus on mutual advantageous investment could help, especially given the deal has strong political backing on both sides. Developing electric vehicles in Indonesia was also a key campaign issue for the newly elected Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto.\nFrom the Australian side, the agreement bolsters the Albanese government\u2019s push to make the nation a green energy superpower. \nOf course, many agreements stay on paper and don\u2019t shape the real world. But this one has a better chance, given the alignment between Indonesia\u2019s efforts to make itself part of the electric vehicle supply chain, and Australia\u2019s dream of becoming a green superpower. \nBilateral agreements like these also show how the world is changing. More and more, middle power cooperation is emerging as a counterbalance against the intensifying Chinese-American rivalry. \nIt\u2019s also a positive sign Australia has realised the need to more actively build alliances across the Indo-Pacific region.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Trade, Indonesia, Environment, Geopolitics, Geothermal, green transition, Critical minerals, Electric vehicles (EVs)","role":"assistant"}]}

However, to achieve the intended outcome, the program needs to be expanded.\nExpanding priorities\nWhile the critical mineral sector is already a priority, expanding the program to create a large-scale battery supply chain where critical minerals such as lithium, nickel, and cobalt are essential, would make Australia more competitive.\nA sovereign battery supply chain would help secure a renewable energy storage system and contribute to producing electric vehicles.\nIn line with this, the government has developed a National Battery Strategy. However, the focus of this should be extended to include exports and installation at residential and business premises.\n\nGiven concerns about supply chain disruption, especially at a time of increased global tensions, other sectors including the health product manufacturing and food processing sectors should also be prioritised.\nDeveloping these industries, which are highly vulnerable to disruption, is important for community well being and economic security.\nBecoming more self-sufficient\nSince the COVID pandemic, Australia has been experiencing dire shortages of critical medicines including blood thinners, antibiotics and hormone replacement therapy medication.\nBy extending the Future Made program to health products, Australia could boost its domestic production of critical medicines and protect against future shortages. This would also increase Australia\u2019s export opportunities.\nAustralia could step up exports to Asia by using its free trade agreements with China, Japan, Korea and other countries in the region.\nDeveloping the local food manufacturing and processing industry should also be a priority to protect against supply disruptions already experienced as a result of the Russia\/Ukraine war, climate-fuelled weather disasters and the pandemic.\nThe food industry accounts for the bulk of Australia\u2019s manufacturing jobs, highlighting its importance in the economic resilience of the country.\nWith the correct government policies, the food and grocery sector could be doubled by 2050, increasing employment by 54% to 427,000 people.\nReducing emissions\nAgriculture should also be included in the priority list. This sector alone was responsible for 16.8% of the country\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2020-21.\nIt is therefore necessary to ensure freight transport and manufacturing of farm inputs, such as energy and water, are sustainable to achieve the net zero target. Green technologies should replace the existing carbon-generated equipment and machinery in the agriculture sector.\n\nThe sector could also be carbon neutralised using microalgae-based technologies. Furthermore, microalgae-based technologies can reduce carbon emissions and pollution for many other manufacturing industries with significant emissions.\nTherefore, the development and large-scale implementation process of green and microalgae-based technologies should also be included in the program.\nThe benefits of Future Made in Australia\nThe Future Made in Australia program\u2019s potential benefits include job creation and skill development, strengthening local industries, securing supply chains and keeping them independent, long term economic growth and cutting carbon emissions.\nUnder the existing priorities numerous jobs are expected to be created in manufacturing, especially in the renewable energy sector. While job growth will be particularly strong in central and northern Queensland which have been selected for renewable energy and hydrogen hubs, jobs will also grow in other parts of the country.\nWith an allocation of $91 million for developing a clean energy workforce, $55.6 million for building women\u2019s career program and $178.6 million for skills and employment supports for regions in transition, the program is expected to contribute heavily to job creation in clean energy and advanced manufacturing sectors. \nNew investment and tax incentives will help develop new industries and boost existing ones including hydrogen and critical minerals production. The incentives will make hydrogen projects commercial sooner and develop green energy manufacturing capabilities to strengthen the renewable energy sector.\nRecent research ranked Australia third in the world for renewable electricity prices in 2030 and 2050, showing its competitiveness in the global arena and potential for economic resilience and growth.\nAustralia is likely to benefit from exporting renewable hydrogen to its international trading partners including Japan, which is planning to import one million tonnes annually, and the European Union which will import 10 million tonnes by 2030.\nThe exporting cost of various hydrogen carriers to Japan is lowest for Australia compared to its competitors. \nSimilarly, Australia could leverage its huge capacity to produce iron and bauxite to become one of the world\u2019s cheapest places for green metals.\nHow Future Made could be even better\nThe Future Made program targets five priority industries: renewable hydrogen, critical minerals processing, green metals, low carbon liquid fuels and clean energy manufacturing.\nExpanding the program to include other critical industries such as agriculture, food processing and health manufacturing and their supply chains will enhance Australia\u2019s economic resilience and security by generating more jobs and ensuring a seamless supply of essential products during future disruptions.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Manufacturing, Carbon emissions, Supply chains, Net zero emissions, Critical minerals, Battery technology, Future Made in Australia Act","role":"assistant"}]}

During these processions, huge banners were put up naming Raisi as \u201cthe martyr of service\u201d, while other banners carried phrases such as \u201cfarewell to the servant of the disadvantaged\u201d.\nThe status of martyr of service means his death was caused by his duty to serve the public as president.\nIn Iran, the martyr narrative is a long-recognised concept in religious tales, politics and literature. \nThe Iranian leadership appears to be trying to use Raisi\u2019s death on May 19 \u2013 and his martyrdom \u2013 as a way of creating more public support in the upcoming election, and potentially prompt a higher turnout on June 28.\n\n\n\n\n\nRaisi was a political hardliner and was close to Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Shortly after the crash, he was declared a martyr on Iranian state TV and was buried in his home city of Mashhad at Iran\u2019s largest Shia shrine, Imam Reza. Imam Reza is Iran\u2019s spiritual capital and has great significance for the country\u2019s history, culture and politics. So the formal announcement of Raisi\u2019s martyrdom at the shrine is significant.  \nGovernment statements after the crash underlined how it wanted to cast Raisi\u2019s death as an almost religious moment. A statement from the Iranian foreign ministry said that: \u201cThe esteemed martyrs of the bitter and tragic incident sincerely gave up their blessed lives to serve Islam and beloved Iran, and they have achieved the great blessing of martyrdom in the path of honest and sincere service to the noble nation of Iran.\u201d\nMartyrdom as a concept is drawn from religious roots, but has a significant political and cultural role in Iran. The government\u2019s use of martyrdom expanded substantially during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988), when around 750,000 Iranians lost their lives as soldiers or civilians. Thousands of ordinary people were hailed as martyrs for defending their country in this period. \nIn 1980 the state established the Martyrs\u2019 Foundation (Bony\u0101d-e \u0160ah\u012bd) to support those injured or disabled in the war and the families of the dead, by the order of the leader of the 1979 Iranian revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.\nThroughout the nation\u2019s history, the question of who a martyr is and what their role might be has changed. New concepts of martyrdom have emerged during the past few years and have been increasingly used by both government and the opposition. For instance, protesters during the Arab Spring were hailed by some as martyrs \u2013 but this was martyr status awarded by the public, rather than the government.\n\nOpponents of the regime also used the concept of martyrdom during the 2022 protests and uprising to name protesters as martyrs for their political activism against the government. In their eyes, martyrs are those who are brutally killed at the hands of the state. Martyrdom, therefore, is also an essential part of the commemoration of the protests. \n\nPositioning Raisi as a martyr \u2013 and underlining his role and sacrifice \u2013 comes weeks ahead of Iranians heading to the polls to vote for a new president in line with Article 131 of the constitution. Early presidential elections must be held within 50 days of a president\u2019s death.\nRaisi won the last presidential election in June 2021 with 18 million of the 28.9 million votes cast, according to government figures. But public turnout was 48.8% \u2014 a significant decline from the previous election in 2017. Public participation also decreased in parliamentary elections in March 2024. According to Iran\u2019s interior minister, Ahmad Vahidi, only 41% of the 61 million eligible voters participated in the elections, one of the lowest turnouts since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. \nThis might suggest public disaffection with the electoral system. But the question now is can the current leadership use the death of Raisi to encourage the public to participate in the election? And will the strategy of using martyrdom work?\nIt is not yet clear whether the idea of political martyrdom will mobilise either fundamentalists or other political groups. But it\u2019s possible that it can be used to create increased political backing for the current political power structure at the upcoming election, and possibly boost turnout.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Islam, Iran, Ebrahim Raisi, Martyrs, Ayatollah Khamenei, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nThe world is seeing a resurgence in the use of espionage as nations try to get inside information on each other. Beijing accused the United Kingdom of recruiting spies in China, just after British authorities charged two men with violating the Official Secrets Act on behalf of Beijing. \nMeanwhile, two men were recently arrested for spying for Russia in Germany, and the US intelligence services are working hard to recruit Kremlin insiders who want to work with them.\nFor the vast majority of the public, their perception of intelligence work has been shaped by the ever popular genre of spy fiction. James Bond, an invention of British author Ian Fleming, was an intelligence officer, who worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service, or MI6, and was able to go undercover in various guises, often with the help of futuristic gadgets. Portrayals of spies and spying are still frequently associated with Bond-like suave characters who smoothly navigate diplomatic receptions. \nIn fiction, they use these (as well as more martial talents), to get to the secrets they have been dispatched to find. This archetype is familiar from spy novels, films and TV series. It is completely misleading, and at the same time not entirely removed from the truth.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntelligence as a career\nOne problem is that in both news reporting and English vernacular, the word \u201cspy\u201d is used to describe both intelligence officers and those they recruit. It is not uncommon for (English-speaking) intelligence officers to accept the label and Bond comparisons. So, these mistakes are easy to make, but the intelligence officer and the recruited spy are not the same.\nPerhaps the most crucial difference is that an intelligence officer has chosen a career. A potentially dangerous career for a few, but a job nevertheless. Traditionally, intelligence officers have often enjoyed diplomatic cover, providing them with immunity from arrest and prosecution. \nSome have served without such immunity, and indeed been sentenced to lengthy prison terms. But they have often been released to their home countries well before the end of their mandated terms by swapping them for people imprisoned by the other side. Such was the fate of Soviet intelligence officer Konon Molody, also known as Gordon Lonsdale in the 1960s, who was returned in a prisoner exchange after serving a mere three years of his 25-year sentence.\nIn 2010, Anna Chapman, a Russian intelligence agent and model, and her compatriots were exchanged for ten Russians (among them Sergei Skripal, who would later barely escape a Russian assassination plot).\n\nIntelligence officers have been selected on the basis of their talents and then trained to hone their skills. In particular, those tasked with recruiting sources tend to be socially adept, likeable and smooth talkers. \nFor example, Richard Sorge, a journalist with a doctorate in political science who was secretly a Soviet intelligence officer, used his German roots to successfully infiltrate German diplomatic circles in Tokyo in the 1930s. A bit like James Bond, he was described as having an irresistible charm. Sorge became close friends with the German military attach\u00e9 (later ambassador) while simultaneously seducing his wife. Sorge also used to race around Tokyo on a motorcycle, in another reflection of the overlap between truth and fiction.\nRecruited spies, on the other hand, are selected solely on the basis of what kind of information they have access to and are willing to hand over. Thus, recruited spies are typically expected to betray their own countries. Even if there is moral justification in some cases, such as Ryszard Kuklinski\u2019s handing over of Warsaw Pact military secrets to the west during the cold war, it remains a more extreme choice than that of the career professional. \nPsychology of spies\nUnlike the intelligence officer, who can look forward to leaving the life of espionage behind at some point, the recruited spy may have to spend the rest of their life looking over their shoulder. In most countries, espionage is a particularly serious offence, and carries a correspondingly heavy penalty. Recruited spies have to lead double lives, presenting a facade of lies even to friends and family. Intelligence officers work for their own country, their own people. Recruited spies work for an outsider, often an adversary.\nWhile some of these recruited spies are coerced, there are also many who have volunteered their services. Among these eager spies, research indicates a disproportionate number of people with psychopathic, narcissistic and immature personalities, as well as many instances of alcohol abuse and personal crises. \nRobert Hanssen, who spied within the FBI on behalf of the Soviet Union and then Russia, has been described as a psychopath. The same goes for John Walker, who sold the secrets of the United States Navy, later recruited family members to work with him. Both men displayed a callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of even their own families, as well as a total lack of remorse. \nStig Wennerstr\u00f6m, a Swedish Air Force colonel who spied for the Soviet Union for decades, had a very clear narcissistic streak (which is evident from his memoirs, in which he claimed that he single-handedly preserved world peace during the cold war through his espionage).\nWhile there may be some similarity between the spies of fiction and the real-life intelligence officers who mingle with diplomats, the recruited spies tend to be a very different breed. Far from the glamour of spy fiction, they tend to be troubled individuals. For them the ending is not likely to be a drive into the sunset as the credits roll, but rather a lonely prison cell.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"China, Pentagon, CIA, Espionage, MI6, Spies, US intelligence, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

Modern research shows that the lack of Black doctors helps explain why about 70% of Black people don\u2019t trust their doctors, and why Black people tend to die younger than their white peers. \nThe evidence is clear: America needs more Black doctors.\nAccording to a 2022 survey of 950,000 doctors by the Association of American Medical Colleges, 63.9% reported their ethnicity as white, and just 5.7% Black or African American. But according to 2023 estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, Black people comprised 13.6% of the population, while white people represent 58.9%. \nThese modern inequalities in medicine have deep roots. As a community health professor, I am always curious how today\u2019s racial health disparities formed in the first place. One window into this history is through the official physician directories published by the American Medical Association, or AMA.\nA limited landscape\nStarting in 1906, the AMA has published directories of all qualified physicians in the U.S. These directories were created to be comprehensive records that excluded \u201cquack\u201d physicians and unqualified graduates of fraudulent medical schools. \nEach physician\u2019s record included a variety of details, including their place of practice and when and where they completed medical training. \nBetween 1906 and 1940, the AMA also insisted on publishing the race of Black doctors. Beside each entry appeared the label \u201ccol.\u201d for \u201ccolored.\u201d\nBased on this information, I created a digitized dataset of the 1906 directory and detailed geographic and demographic patterns associated with where Black doctors trained and practiced. Of the 41,828 physicians listed in the 1906 directory, only 746 were Black \u2013 or 1.8%.\n\nMost Black doctors in the South were trained by a handful of Southern medical schools established to educate African Americans. Over half \u2013 57% \u2013 of Southern Black physicians attended Meharry Medical College in Nashville, Tennessee, or Howard University Medical School in Washington, D.C. \u2013 schools that are still in existence.\nBut nearly a third \u2013 29% \u2013 of Southern Black physicians attended schools that would be closed a few years after the 1906 directory\u2019s release. In 1910, at the behest of the AMA, educator Abraham Flexner released a report after studying the standards of medical schools in the U.S. and Canada. \nThe results of the Flexner report was devastating to the number of Black doctors. Citing low admissions standards and poor quality of education, Flexner recommended closing five of the seven historically Black medical schools that trained the vast majority of Black doctors. \nBy 1912, three Black medical schools were shut down. By 1924, only two remained in operation \u2013 Meharry and Howard.\nThe consequences of this extremely limited educational landscape for aspiring Black physicians are reflected in the data. In most Southern states, the distance between medical school and practice locations was significantly greater, even before the closings,  for Black doctors compared with their white counterparts.\nThe deep roots of inequalities\nTo help interpret where Black doctors established practices in the South, I also linked directory data to other historical sources, including the U.S. Census. \nWhat I found was that places with larger Black populations were more likely to have a Black doctor, as were places that were closer to a Black medical school. \n\nMany contemporary scholars and activists are looking to the past in order to increase the public\u2019s understanding of how race has played a historical role in the health outcomes of Black Americans.\nFor example, Dr. Uch\u00e9 Blackstock, a Black physician, illustrates many instances of medical racism throughout American history in her most recent book, \u201cLegacy: A Black Physician Reckons with Racism in Medicine,\u201d  and shows their lasting impacts on how Black patients are treated and the quality of health care they receive.\nShe was one of the first, for example, to warn health officials about the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. As she wrote in 2020: Black Americans were more vulnerable during the pandemic \u201cbecause of several manifestations of structural racism, including lack of access to testing, a higher chronic disease burden and racial bias within health care institutions.\u201d\nWithout an accounting of how racial disparities in medicine were formed, it\u2019s much more difficult to determine which kinds of progressive measures are needed to provide redress.\nFuture analyses will help unpack these racial disparities in greater detail. But for now, both academic researchers and the public can use our data to explore the importance of historically Black medical schools and the lives of Black physicians during the Jim Crow era. \nIt\u2019s my belief that their legacies deserve to be a better-known part of the history of American medicine. \nThe headline on this article was updated to correct a typo.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Diversity, Affirmative action, Howard University, Health disparities, American Medical Association, medical racism, HBCU, DEI","role":"assistant"}]}

Greg Abbott predicted would happen once the COVID-19 restrictions \u2013 officially known as Title 42  \u2013 expired.\nFrom what we learned, the actual rush of thousands of people across the border occurred in the days before Title 42 was lifted on May 11, 2023. Many migrants told us they saw it as their last chance to cross the U.S. border. \n\n\n\n\n\nMost people we talked to were waiting in overcrowded, temporary camps in Mexico. They feared that if they tried to cross into the U.S., they would lose their opportunity to seek asylum and would be deported under restrictive polices unveiled during the Biden administration.\nThe situation at the border has constantly changed ever since. In June 2024, for instance, President Joe Biden signed an executive order limiting the number of asylum seekers at the border to no more than a weekly average of 2,500 migrants. The new restrictions would be lifted once that weekly average dropped to 1,500.\nThe crackdown came shortly after the election of Mexico\u2019s first female president Claudia Sheinbaum whose policies on immigration remain largely unknown.\nBut the brief period when Title 42 ended is a perfect illustration of the differences between right-wing hysteria and the realities on the ground. \nThe evolution of US border policy\nSince the fall of 2019, I have been working at the Mexican border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros \u2013 across from McAllen and Brownsville, Texas.  That year, the Trump administration had started the Migrant Protection Protocols.\nKnown as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d the restrictive policy ended the possibility of asylum for about 70,000 migrants, mostly from Central America. Instead, they were forced to wait in Mexico with little realistic chance of being able to legally enter and stay in the U.S. Anyone who entered the country illegally was deported immediately and barred from applying for asylum for five years.\nThe border became even more restrictive during the COVID-19 pandemic when Title 42 was implemented in March 2020. It limited entry into the U.S. at the border to U.S citizens and residents.\nTraditional ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border were closed to asylum-seekers in order to prevent the spread of COVID. For example, those who came to the ports of entry at the international bridges in Reynosa or Matamoros would be turned back at the halfway point and not allowed to touch U.S. soil. \nAs a result, most of the people whom we talked to in 2023 were waiting in Mexico and fearful.\nInside the asylum camps\nThroughout 2020 and 2021, my academic and nonprofit colleagues witnessed migrants toiling in squalid, makeshift camps. \nOne of the first asylum camps was formed during the last days of the Trump administration across from Brownsville, Texas, in Matamoros, Mexico. The Mexican government allowed faith-based organizations and nongovernment organizations such as Team Brownsville and Solidarity Engineering to bring in tents, food, water and other supplies. \nBefore long, thousands of individuals \u2013 primarily from Central America \u2013 were sleeping on the streets next to the international bridge that connected the town to Brownsville.\nAt one point, the camp had about 3,000 people living in it. There were only two portable toilets.\n\nA second, unofficial camp started around the same time in the city square of Reynosa, a town located across the border from Hidalgo, Texas. It also became overrun with people, making it difficult to even walk through the camp. Mothers told us stories of being unable to sleep at night because of the constant fear of sexual assault and violence.\nUnlike many refugee camps around the world, these camps often have very little structure, almost no security and little organization. Though there are some portable toilets and, at times, makeshift showers, sanitation is a serious issue. Many people bathe in the nearby Rio Grande. \nFood is scarce. Every so often, churches and nonprofit relief groups provide some aid. But it is never enough to meet the demand.\n\nThe most serious issue for those staying at the camps is protection from  organized crime and drug cartels. Families with young girls were especially concerned, as sexual assaults were reported in the camps.\nWomen were afraid to venture out at night. Out of desperation, some even sent their children across the U.S. border alone in the hope they would be allowed to stay in the U.S. \nAs dangerous as that journey was, they believed it was more dangerous for the children to remain in the cartel-filled camps.\nCritical choices\nThus far in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, immigration has emerged as one of the top issues among voters.\nIn this polarized political environment, it would be easy for those across the political spectrum to conclude that the border is chaotic and needs to be closed. \nIn my view, closing the border permanently \u2013 as former President Donald Trump and other right-wing lawmakers have sought to do \u2013 would be a mistake and not in the best interests of national security, the U.S. economy and, ultimately, the lives of asylum-seekers.\nAs a researcher who has spent countless hours with asylum-seekers and other migrants, I believe that restrictive policies \u2013 from either Trump or Biden \u2013 are helpful only to organized crime, which is often controlling immigration on the ground along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nThis often puts asylum-seekers in great danger, both from direct violence from the cartels and from the harsh terrain they must traverse to avoid detection by immigration officials. \nIf Trump returns to the White House or U.S. President Joe Biden chooses to take a harsher stance, more restrictive border policies could force people who have already fled their homelands to either stay in cartel-controlled camps or risk dying trying to enter the U.S. illegally.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Asylum, Mexico, Joe Biden, Donald Trump, US immigration, GOP, anti-immigrant attitudes, Southern border, right wing extremism, COVID-19, US immigration policy, Title 42","role":"assistant"}]}

We\u2019re seeing this with the increasing concern to protect kids from the harmful effects of social media. \nThis week Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sympathised with calls for limits on children\u2019s access to social media, while last week\u2019s budget allocated funds for a trial of age verification, originally recommended by the eSafety Commissioner. The government in November also brought forward by a year the scheduled review of the Online Safety Act.\nBut on the whole, the federal government has been lagging behind the states and activist parents on an issue that has immense ramifications for a young generation that has been recording increased levels of stress and mental health problems. \nSouth Australian Premier Peter Malinauskas has recently  said his government will legislate, if feasible, to prohibit children under 14 accessing social media accounts. For those aged 14-15, parental consent would be needed.\nThis week Malinauskas had talks in Washington with the United States Surgeon General Vivek Murthy about the issue. The premier later told the Adelaide Advertiser Murthy had endorsed the SA plan. \n\u201c[Murthy] was essentially saying, governments don\u2019t have time to waste because this is now creating almost a mental health emergency among young people.\u201d Murthy also told him  young people  were more open to the idea of relinquishing social media than often thought, if their friends were off it, too. \n\nIn New South Wales, Premier Chris Minns this week announced a summit, to be held in October, \u201cto address the increasing harm online platforms are having on children and young people\u201d. \nIn Minns\u2019 electorate of Kogarah, in Sydney\u2019s south, there\u2019s been intense activity on the issue. A group of parents with children at Our Lady of Fatima Catholic Primary School and St Ursula\u2019s College got together a few years ago to discuss delaying their kids getting onto smartphones and social media. \nParent Dany Elachi, whose daughter was ten at the time, told me they thought concerted action gave them the best chance of \u201cstaying the course\u201d  against the pressure from their children\u2019s complaints, or pleas, that \u201ceveryone else\u201d had a smartphone. \nThe group of parents had no connection with Minns, then opposition leader, until reading an article by him in their local paper. His concerns chimed with their own and they reached out to him. \nThe Heads Up Alliance is now a national movement  of thousands of Australian parents delaying smartphones  and social media for their children. \nThe group lobbied Catholic authorities, and there is now a widespread ban on mobile phones in Sydney Catholic schools. \nMinns, as premier last year, implemented a ban on mobile phones in NSW public schools. All states and territories have acted on phone bans, with Queensland and the ACT falling into line earlier this year.  \nThese have been important steps, but perhaps the easy ones.  More robust action involves greater challenges to big tech and their revenue and customer streams. Capturing the kids is central to their business models. \nThe Albanese government has already had a taste of what taking on big tech can look like in its fight with Elon Musk over the eSafety Commissioner\u2019s demand that X (formerly Twitter) remove a post showing the stabbing of a bishop at a Sydney Assyrian church. \nTougher action in dealing with social media is one area where  potential bipartisanship should be possible. Federal opposition communications spokesman David Coleman has been a strong proponent of protecting children and age verification. \nThe NSW summit will  be attended by senior officials, academics, representatives from other jurisdictions, and people from  leading social media platforms. \n\nThe idea of age-limited access to social media \u2013 the next logical step \u2013 is guaranteed to be a hot topic. \nWhile states have been leading the way, to have a prospect of working properly, any legislated ban on young people accessing social media sites needs to be national. There are likely also constitutional constraints  to be overcome. Minns has expressed doubt a ban would be enforceable at the state level.\nSome  social media companies argue they don\u2019t accept children under 13 setting up accounts.  But this has been unenforceable, even assuming the companies wanted to enforce it.\nAlbanese said: \u201cWe want to make sure that any changes that are made actually work. You don\u2019t want them being circumvented around the side door, if you like.\u201d \nThat\u2019s right \u2013 up to a point. It should not be an excuse for avoiding action. In reality, no ban is likely to be absolutely watertight. \nCritics of a ban cite privacy, concerned about the sort of information that would be handed to tech companies to establish a user\u2019s age. But age has to be proven in many circumstances, and various methods could be used to minimise the privacy problem. \nAlso, some critics say social media is important especially for young people who need connection; they say there would be harm in denying this to them. Here it\u2019s a question of weighing one side against the other: the negatives of social media against the positives for young people. \nIn his recent widely-publicised book,  The Anxious Generation, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt argues Gen Z (born after 1995)  have been  \u201crewired\u201d. He dubs them the \u201cthe anxious generation\u201d. \nWith a combination of over-protective parents and the ubiquity of modern tech, Haidt says we\u2019ve seen a move from a \u201cplay-based childhood\u201d to a \u201cphone-based childhood\u201d. \n\u201cGen Z became the first  generation in history to go through puberty  with a portal in their pockets  that called them away from the people nearby  and into an alternative universe  that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and  [\u2026] unsuitable for children and adolescents,\u201d Haidt writes. \nThis had serious consequences for their mental health, he argues, with girls adversely affected in particular by social media, and boys more by pornography and addiction to video gaming. \nWhile Haidt primarily writes of the American scene, he includes findings from other western countries, which he says show similar trends. \nHaidt prescribes four lines of action. Parents should not give their children smartphones before high school. Children should not be on social media before 16. Schools should be phone-free.  Children should have more unsupervised play and childhood independence. \nThose who fear that social media, for all its pluses, can be a serious threat to young people, will believe a lot more needs to be done than we\u2019re doing now. The burden is not one that can be carried by government, schools, or other authorities alone. Parents must also do their part. But parents need help from the institutions to do it. \nBack at ground zero in the battle to curb harm from social media, Dany and his wife have \u201cstayed the course\u201d. Their daughter, now almost 15, doesn\u2019t have a smartphone or a social media account. \u201cWe bought her a basic phone,\u201d Dany says. \u201cBut it\u2019s so unappealing she rarely uses it.\u201d \n.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Social media, Domestic violence, mobile phone ban, eSafety, social issues, Chris Minns, Online Safety Act, Peter Malinauskas, Teens and social media","role":"assistant"}]}

The term conveys the notion of something both grand and final.\n\nThis was the opening paragraph, written by curator Victoria Lynn, for the catalogue accompanying Rosemary Laing\u2019s exhibition swansongs, at Tolarno Galleries in March of this year. Ironically the title was apt. It was Laing\u2019s last exhibition before her untimely death after a short illness at age 65.\nThe Australian photographer and former educator originally trained as a painter and brought a certain sensibility of the painter\u2019s hand to her practice. \nPhotography enabled her to challenge how we think about social, cultural, and historical issues because of the medium\u2019s relationship to reality. \nHer unique approach engaged with the nature of place, inhabitation and Australia\u2019s colonial history, but also to technology, time and speed \u2013 elements seen in her work since the 1980s.\n\n\n\n\n\nKnown for her groundbreaking photo-media series flight research (1999) and bulletproofglass (2002), her work came to be \u201cembedded in our psyche,\u201d as Melbourne\u2019s Tolarno Galleries has commented.\n\nInterventions in the landscape\nLike a 19th century painter, Laing often worked en plein air, eschewing the studio to respond to the landscape with certain interventions that laid bare our ongoing impact on nature. \nSuch works of intense, persistent labour saw her travelling to the southern alps of New Zealand in 2018 to produce skyground. \nThese sensuous, yet unsettling images undo what we think the landscape should look like. When hung, they appear inverted: the ground above and the sky below, relaying a \u201csense of slow-motion disaster,\u201d as artist and writer Tanya Peterson has referred to it. \n\nLaing\u2019s concern with natural and unnatural disasters can be traced through a number of photographic series that draw our attention to weather, floods, bushfires, pollution, land degradation, but also to colonisation. \nBuddens (2017) and Groundspeed (2001) are incongruous in their clash of nature, domesticity and industrial labour. \nIn Buddens, Laing replaced the river\u2019s flow through the landscape of Wreck Bay with discarded red-toned clothes recalling the debris left behind in floods or ship disasters. In Groundspeed, Laing meticulously laid Feltex carpet patterned with European floral motifs across the forest floor.\n\nIn effort + rush (2015), Laing takes us to Madagascar, where Laing had to reconcile the expected consumptive tourist image with the devastated landscape. Images capture the rush of bushfires devouring the earth. \nUsing the camera as a paintbrush, these works remind us of the force of nature but also of human destruction, often seen in a blur as we race through the landscape in speeding vehicles.\n\nThe intersection of nature and culture with technology and speed can be seen in brownwork (1996\u201397), described by curator Blair French as picturing flight in a contradictory state of being, and greenwork (1995), which saw her producing large-scale documentary and staged images. \nExperimenting with digital interventions and time-lapse, Laing encapsulated \u201cfluid abstractions of flight,\u201d as she called it in a 1998 interview in Art & Text. \nIn some photographs we see the residue of plane jet streams held in a strange state between stasis and flux. In others, the vivid green forests seemingly rupture from a moment of stillness into motion in a rare digital intervention.   \n\nDark histories\nLaing was also deeply affected by the intersection of nature and the dark, shameful history of Australia\u2019s treatment of its First peoples, its migrants and refugees. As she commented:\n\nthe arrival of people, throughout history, shifts what happens in land, challenging those who have left their elsewhere, and disrupting the continuum of their destination place. A disruption causes a reconfiguration. It elaborates both the beforehand and the afterward.\n\nHer photographic series swansongs (2024) and poems for recent times (2021) reflect on the horrific, unsettling Black Summer bushfires that raged across the Shoalhaven and neighbouring regions in 2019\u201320, which saw Laing move to the studio for these contemplative works.\n\nWhat at first look not unlike traditional still-life paintings in poems for recent times, Laing embeds these images with unquiet signs of repair in bandaged twigs, and loss and remembrance in floral tributes,  along with signs of new life rising from the ashes. \nThis sense of unquiet was personal for Laing as she and her partner, artist Geoff Kleem, watched on as the fires crept up to the edges of the lake near their home.\nThree years later, Laing continued this concern in swansongs, with assemblages of crustaceans animated by reparative interventions; bandages or \u201ceveryday things that mend, bind or heal a wound,\u201d as Victoria Lynn writes. \n\nThe exhibition featured photographs that capture suspended crustacean shellwork in vivid arrangements set against the photographic background of previous series, along with the shellwork subjects positioned on precarious shelves. \nThe sense of recuperation, recycling and repair in these works reminds of the fragility of life, but also of European impact on Australia\u2019s nature and its first inhabitants.\nMaking us look\nAs Laing said of swansongs, the photographs relate to \n\na love of, an attachment to, homeland or places of belonging \u2026 all the memories and histories that have stemmed from that place, and the making of a kind of \u2018song\u2019 that combines the enigma of this attachment with a sadness for what has happened in this place.\n\nThe last time I saw Rosemary, we were yet again talking incessantly about photography and looking at the numerous photographs of sunsets at Swan Lake on her phone; \u201cLook at this one, and this\u2026 and what about the colour in this\u2026\u201d she said. \nAlways looking, always making us look.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Photography, Visual art, Obituary, Australian artists, Visual art and design","role":"assistant"}]}

Additionally, many of them were closely related, including two pairs of identical twins, evoking important themes of Mayan mythology.\nThese ancient genomes also show that, despite European colonialism, the genetic legacy of the ancient Maya continues in today\u2019s Indigenous people from the region.\nDiscovery of the ancient chult\u00fan at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1\nThe Maya civilisation was a Mesoamerican culture on the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula in Mexico. The city of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 emerged at around 250 CE and ended in 1697 CE with the Spanish conquest of the region. It was one of the largest and most influential Mayan cities, and a political centre of the civilisation.\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 is one of the most intensively studied archaeological sites in all of Mesoamerica. It contains two ceremonially important features. Most well-known is Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1\u2019s largest structure, El Castillo (also known as the Temple of Kukulk\u00e1n).\nImportant, too, was the Sacred Cenote (also known as the Well of Sacrifice), a natural sinkhole leading to an underground water source. Dredging excavations since the early 1900s have recovered, among other things, golden artefacts and human skeletons from the bottom of the cenote.\n\nDuring the 1967 construction of an airport runway 300 metres northeast of the Sacred Cenote, a chult\u00fan (a human-made cistern typically built for storing drinkable water) was discovered.\nThe chamber and an adjacent cave contained many skeletal remains covered by mostly undisturbed bark and limestone powder, as well as animal bones and ceramic objects.\nRadiocarbon dating placed these ritual sacrifices over a 500-year period, from approximately 600 CE until 1100 CE, around the time of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1\u2019s decline.\n\nIt is thought the sacrifices were associated with the agricultural cycles of corn, an important staple crop for the Maya. Or they may have been given as offerings to the Maya rain deity Chaac. \nHowever, despite years of study, many questions about the use of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 and whether the Mayan people had left a genetic legacy remained unanswered.\nWho was sacrificed and placed in the chult\u00fan?\nDue to Spanish accounts from the 16th century, and skeletal remains dredged from the Sacred Cenote, it was believed mostly young women and girls were sacrificed at the site.\nHowever, our new genetic results of remains found in the chult\u00fan showed each of the individuals was male. Previous analyses showed that about half of the sacrificed individuals were between the ages of 3 to 6 years, and none had reached adulthood.\n\nBy studying DNA collected from the petrous bones (the site in which the inner ear sits, and one of the densest bones in the human organism) of the skeletons, we learned that one-quarter of the individuals were closely related. This is much higher than we normally observe in other studies, even for ancient cemeteries.\nTwins in Mayan mythology\nEven more intriguing was the discovery of two pairs of identical twins in the Chult\u00fan. Identical twins occur in only around 0.4% of pregnancies, and so observing two pairs of twins out of 64 individuals is unlikely to happen by chance. Hence, we think they may have been specially selecting twins for these sacrifices.\nThis discovery did not come as a surprise to us, given the importance of twins in Mayan mythology and Classic Maya art.\nFor example, twins and sacrifice are central themes in the sacred Mayan Book, the Popol Vuh, where the Hero Twins Hunahp\u00fa and Xbalanqu\u00e9 outwit the gods of the underworld and avenge their murdered father and his brother (who were also twins).\n\nThe discovery of identical twins and other close relatives in a ritual mass burial of male children suggests young boys may have been selected for sacrifice because of their biological kinship, and the importance of twins in Maya mythology.\nGenetic continuity into today\nWe also sampled DNA from 68 present-day Maya people from the nearby town of Tixcacaltuyub. By comparing the modern and ancient genomes, the study revealed long-term genetic continuity.\nHowever, when comparing the genes associated with immunity, clear differences could be observed between the pre- and post-colonial era Maya individuals. Namely, present-day individuals carry genes that increased resistance to many of the diseases introduced in the 1500s by Europeans during the colonial period, especially for typhoid fever caused by Salmonella. \nThis shows that not only the present-day Maya of southeastern Mexico carry the genetic legacy of its past inhabitants, but they carry the signatures of overcoming past diseases through centuries.\nOverall, this study shows an intimate portrait of ritual life at Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These fascinating results suggest the genetic legacy of the ancient Maya inhabitants is still present in the peoples and communities that live in the region surrounding the ancient city of Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1 today.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"History, Archaeology, Human history, Maya, MesoAmerica, New research, Australia New Zealand","role":"assistant"}]}
{"messages":[{"content":"generate 5 tags from the following article in this format [\"tag1\", \"tag2\", \"tag3\", \"tag4\", \"tag5\"] and output nothing else:\n\nSpeaking at a surprise address to the nation on Sunday evening, French president Emmanuel Macron told French citizens he had \u201cdecided to give [them] back the choice of our parliamentary future through the vote\u201d. These words, pronounced in reaction to the historic surge of the far-right National Rally at the European elections, triggered the dissolution of France\u2019s parliament and snap elections on 30 June and 7 July. Clea Chakraverty of The\u00a0Conversation France spoke to the French parliament specialist, Julien Robin, to understand what the decision could mean for French politics.\n\nClea Chakraverty: How can European results have such an impact on the French parliament?\nJulien Robin: For a long time, the European vote was considered to be of \u201csecond order\u201d \u2013 a term coined by political scientists Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt to describe the first European elections in 1979. These were elections that were not national, and in which voter turnout was often lower than in \u201cfirst-order\u201d elections.\nHowever, since the 2014 European elections, voter turnout has been on the rise, at 42.43% \u2013 that\u2019s 1.8 points higher than in 2009. This trend is confirmed by the 2024 ballot, which will have galvanised more voters than in 2019 (+2.5 points compared to the turnout of 50.12% in 2019). Turnout is now at its highest since the 1994 European elections.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother element to have strengthened European elections is the 2019 reform of the voting system. Whereas deputies for the European elections in France were previously divided in eight regional electoral constituencies (see figure 1), the voting system now only comprises a single national constituency. This has allowed voters to better identify candidates as well as the issues at stake.\n\nAbove all, these elections have now become a referendum on Macron and an electoral springboard for political forces (notably the National Rally, the left-wing politician Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Unbowed, and even centrist Renaissance).\nIn recent days, we have been able to see the election take on a further national character through the format of television debates. Take, for example, the two-way debate between the far-right candidate Jordan Bardella and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, on 24 May, or Macron\u2019s proposal to debate Marine Le Pen as part of the European elections campaign. These events echo the presidential election of 2022, or even give a possible foretaste of that of 2027.\nWhen was the last time the French parliament was dissolved, and what does it tell us about the current state of French politics?\nThe last dissolution dates back to 1997 and was triggered by President Jacques Chirac. His intention was to breathe new life into the presidential majority in the National Assembly, which had been weakened by the mass demonstrations against the 1995 pension reform and the 1997 deficit reduction plans. At the time, the majority in the National Assembly was not strictly that of President Chirac. It had emerged from the 1993 elections, two years before he was elected head of state. By attempting to galvanise voters at the ballot box, Chirac\u2019s decision would ultimately lead to the advent of the plural left, with a government led by Lionel Jospin.\n\nPolitically, the context was thorny for Macron, with a minority government in the National Assembly. To force through unpopular measures, the government has therefore had to increasingly rely on bypassing parliament by invoking article 49.3. Meanwhile, there have been increasing rumours of no confidence votes. Not to mention the explosion in the number of political groups in the National Assembly, of which there are now ten, which make it tricky for the government to obtain stable majorities for the vote on bills.\nWe can see Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the national assembly as true to form. The president, after all, loves disruption. The move can be interpreted as a show of power, giving back the voice to voters in the form of legislative elections.\nWhat\u2019s at stake now at the National Assembly?\nOne issue observers will be watching will be whether parliament comes out of the June\u00a02024 elections as fragmented as in June\u00a02022. Back then, the parliament\u2019s resulting division in ten parliamentary groups was unprecedented for the Fifth Republic. The new structure will have a real impact on work flow at the Assembly.\nFor the political groupings, there are several issues at stake:\n\non the left: these elections will determine the new balance of power between the various stakeholders in the New Ecological and Social People\u2019s Union (NUPES), France\u2019s left-wing electoral alliance created in 2022 including France Unbowed (LFI), the Socialist Party (PS), the Communist Party (PCF), the Greens and other small parties. Clouds have been hanging over the alliance after France Unbowed refused to qualify Hamas as a terrorist group in October\u00a02023. The European elections have now shifted power from France Unbowed to the social democrats, which have been boosted to third place. The Greens, on the other hand, have lost considerable support. As soon as the results were announced, their candidate, Marie Toussaint, as well as other leftwing figures called for discussions on a joint list.\nfor the RN: while in a secret poll commissioned by the Republicans in December\u00a02023, the RN was predicted to have a majority in the event of early general elections, the real issue is whether the RN will succeed in coming to power by obtaining a real majority in the National Assembly, which is necessary to obtain the government\u2019s confidence. The RN\u2019s exceptional result in the European elections (16 points ahead of the current majority) is a real springboard for these early elections.\nfor Renaissance: at a time when the question of the post-Macron era has arisen as soon as he is re-elected in 2022, Renaissance will have to consider its political positioning and, above all, the possibility of forming electoral alliances with Les R\u00e9publicains at local level. This could be a foregone conclusion, since St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9, as SG of Renaissance, announced this evening to AFP that the majority \u201cwill not present a candidate\u201d against outgoing MPs \u201cwho are part of the Republican field\u201d.\n\nThe issue is that in seven years, the presidential party has gone from having the largest majority in the National Assembly under the V\u1d49 Republic in 2017, to a relative majority in 2022, and then a possible move into opposition.\nIn addition, the challenge for the Republicans is to see whether the party will still remain a real national political force, knowing that it has just achieved its worst score in a European election, and above all what position will be adopted in the event of the RN\u2019s success in the next legislative elections.\nCan the President\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly be seen as an admission of weakness? What could be the presidential party\u2019s strategy?\nMacron is both admitting his weakness and anticipating a likely no confidence vote \u2013 something that has been announced for months by certain groups in the Assembly. It is also a sign that President Macron will have experienced all the unprecedented situations under the Fifth Parliament: the largest majority, then a minority government and now a dissolution.\nIs a cohabitation with the National Rally conceivable? Or could we even imagine a radical change to the French party system?\nA cohabitation with the RN is conceivable, but we\u2019ll have to see what happens after these early general elections. According to political scientists Bruno J\u00e9rome, Philippe Mongrain and Richard Nadeau, the French party system was in the process of quadripolarisation. The four blocs are the traditional left and right, as well as Macronian centrism and the RN. From now on, the European elections will settle the internal tensions within each bloc:\n\nRN: Should it pursue a strategy of \u201cnormalisation\u201d even if it means losing votes to Reconqu\u00eate?\nThe right: With whom should it form a coalition (or at least come to an agreement), not only to survive politically, but also to maximise its influence in parliament?\nThe Macronist centre: How can it reinvent itself in a second term which sounds like the end of its reign?\nThe left (overall): Will the social-democratic (PS) or the radical (LFI) line dominate? Is there a third way with the emergence of the increasingly popular Fran\u00e7ois Ruffin?\n\nNever have the European elections had such an impact on French politics.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"European Union (EU), France, European parliament (EP), French politics, Far right, EU elections, Emmanuel Macron, The Conversation Europe, European elections 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

Recently, their fiery nature has even caused a bit of a stir in Denmark, where Buldak Ramen noodles have been banned for being dangerously spicy. So, what\u2019s behind the burning sensation we experience when we bite into a chilli pepper, and why do some people seek out the masochism of a super hot curry or Korean instant noodles? \nThe culprit: capsaicin\nChilli peppers\u2019 illusion of heat is all down to a chemical called capsaicin. It binds to a protein called TRPV1, which sits in the membranes of sensory nerves, particularly in our digestive system (most notably our mouths), nose and skin.\nTRPV1 is normally involved in our ability to sense painfully high temperatures. However, in the presence of capsaicin, the TPRV1 is triggered at lower temperatures, tricking us into reacting as if we\u2019re being burned. \nThis deception prompts our body to initiate an inflammatory response similar to what happens with actual burns, leading to swelling, sweating and discomfort. In fact, this very mechanism meant capsaicin was instrumental in identifying and studying the mechanisms involved in our ability to sense heat, for which David Julius received a Nobel prize in 2021.\nIn the wild, chilli plants have evolved to produce capsaicin to deter mammals from eating the fruit. It seems that only humans are daft enough to actually seek out the chilli-induced burning. The only other mammal that is happy to munch on chillies are some tree shrews, who have acquired a mutation in their TRPV1 genes making them able to tolerate high doses of capsaicin.\nAll birds, however, are unaffected by the spice, as their heat sensors work differently. Indeed, birds play a crucial role for the chilli plant by consuming the fruit and dispersing seeds over a wide area. \nThis also makes for a good gardening life hack. If you are plagued with rats and squirrels eating bird feed then simply dose it with chilli powder and any rodents will be deterred from returning for another taste.  \nHow hot is hot?\nThe pungency of peppers is measured using the Scoville scale and Scoville heat units (SHU), developed by Wilbur Scoville in 1912. \n\nThe original method involved extracting capsaicin from the peppers and then diluting the solution until a group of volunteers could no longer feel the heat. For example, if 1ml of a jalape\u00f1o chilli extract had to be diluted in ten litres of water before the taste testers could no longer sense it, then the jalape\u00f1o would sit at 10,000 on the Scoville scale. \nThis was a rather subjective method, so in the 1980s it was replaced with a more analytical method that directly measures the concentration of capsaicin in the extract. \nHowever, the scale still bears Scoville\u2019s name. On that scale sits the perfectly palatable sweet bell pepper (zero SHU), the heady heat of a Tabasco pepper (up to 50,000 SHU) and the extreme pain of the world record holder \u2013 Pepper X (2.7 million SHU). \nMeanwhile, various online sources claim the hottest Buldak Ramen noodles sit around 9,000 SHU. \nThe perils and pleasures of spicy food\nEating extremely spicy food can be an intense experience. Many of us enjoy the hot sensations, and some people report a spice-induced natural \u201chigh\u201d, which may be caused by the release of endorphins in response to the spicy heat. \nMeanwhile, we\u2019ve all seen those videos of people sweating, turning red and sometimes even crying after biting into something too hot. \n\nConsuming too much spice can certainly lead to sweating, nausea, vomiting and some gastrointestinal distress. But there isn\u2019t a great deal of evidence for serious or long-term health issues directly linked to hot food, leading some to wonder if the Danish authorities overreacted.   \nDealing with the heat\nWhat do you do if you\u2019ve bitten off more than you can chew, spice-wise? \nDrinking water won\u2019t help. In fact, it can make things worse by spreading the capsaicin around your mouth. Instead, reach for something fatty. Capsaicin dissolves in fat, so drinking full-fat milk, eating yoghurt or even nibbling on some cheese can help. \nAcidic foods like lemon or lime juice may help to neutralise the heat, and starchy foods like bread or rice can absorb the capsaicin and give your mouth a break. Of course, these may alleviate the fire in your mouth, but it may be too late to help with any follow through.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Heat, Capsaicin, Scoville heat units, chilli pepper, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

Although most apps, including Grindr, removed their ethnicity filters in the past few years, others, such as Hinge and Match, have not. \nWhile people may think that whom they find desirable is a personal preference, attraction is influenced by family members\u2019 views, the schools people attend, friends and society in general and dating sites themselves. I am a legal scholar who researches race and the law. As I argue in my new book, \u201cThe Architecture of Desire: How the Law Shapes Interracial Intimacy and Perpetuates Inequality,\u201d the legacy of discriminatory laws that have been struck down still influences people\u2019s romantic preferences by limiting opportunities for interracial relationships to develop. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSegregation laws limited interracial relationships\nUntil the 1960s, some U.S. state laws prohibited white people from marrying Black Americans, Asians Americans and Native Americans. These laws \u2013 known formally as anti-miscegenation laws \u2013 were in effect in 41 states, including Maryland, California, Oregon and Virginia, at some point between 1661 and 1967. \nThen, Mildred Loving, a Black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, successfully challenged Virginia\u2019s anti-miscegenation law known as the Racial Integrity Act. They were convicted of violating this law by marrying each other in another state and returning to their Virginia home. In the case aptly named Loving v. Virginia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that these anti-miscegenation laws were \u201cdesigned to maintain White Supremacy\u201d and declared them unconstitutional.  \nOther old laws in effect until the 1960s also hindered interracial relationships indirectly. \nThe Naturalization Act of 1790 provided that only free white persons could become naturalized U.S. citizens. Although the Naturalization Act of 1870 extended eligibility to persons of African descent, it did not extend eligibility to other racial and ethnic groups.   \nThe Supreme Court affirmed these laws when it determined in 1922 and also in 1923 that people of Asian ancestry were not white and could not become naturalized U.S. citizens. These laws significantly reduced the pool of desirable marital partners by ruling out people of Asian ancestry. The Immigration Act of 1924 also barred individuals of Asian ancestry, except for Filipinos, since the Philippines was a U.S. colony, from immigrating to the U.S.\nCongress abolished these race-based exclusions in 1952 when it passed the Immigration and Nationality Act. But it did not eliminate the U.S. government\u2019s preferences for immigrants from Western European countries until 1965, when it passed another Immigration and Nationality Act that abolished quotas for immigrants from particular countries.  \nHousing and educational discriminatory laws\nUntil the late 1960s, federal, state and local governments promoted and enforced discriminatory housing policies, such as redlining and racially restrictive covenants, that segregated African Americans and other racial groups from white people.\nThese policies determined where people of color could live and send their children to school. Since they could not live in predominantly white neighborhoods, their children could not attend schools with white children, as students were assigned to their local school. \nState laws and local practices in most Southern states, as well as California and Texas, among others, required Black, Asian American, Mexican American and Native American children to attend separate schools without any white students. These policies\u2019 primary goal was to \u201cto prevent the formation of interracial relationships in public schools\u201d, as the legal and race scholar Reginald Oh has argued. \nThe legacy of old discriminatory laws\nThese explicitly discriminatory laws that impeded interracial relationships until 1967 have all been abolished. \nThe Fair Housing Act banned housing discrimination in 1968. School districts can no longer separate or exclude children based on race. \nThere are now federal laws and laws in every state that prohibit businesses open to the public from discrimination based on race or ethnicity.  \nYet, these old laws left a legacy that still limits opportunities for interracial interactions online and offline.\nResidential segregation persists as a result of decades of federal, state and local practices that excluded racial minorities from white neighborhoods. \nHouses and apartments in predominately white neighborhoods remain out of reach for many people of color, as real estate prices have skyrocketed. Affordable housing is also concentrated in low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods. \nAs a result of this residential segregation, many Black and Latino children attend what education scholars Gary Orfield and Danielle Jarvie refer to as \u201capartheid schools\u201d in high-poverty neighborhoods with few white students. \nThe opportunities for meaningful interactions across race in the workplace \u2013 where some people meet their romantic partners \u2013 are also limited. Black Americans, for example, are disproportionately clustered in low-wage positions and sectors, making intimate relationships with the predominantly white managerial and professional staff unlikely.\n\nBoundaries on dating apps\nOnline dating is now the most common way to meet a romantic partner, so you might assume that the lack of opportunities for meaningful interracial interactions at school, in the workplace and around the neighborhood do not matter. I believe that they do matter. By facilitating segregation, these defunct laws not only influence whom people meet offline but whom they are interested in meeting online. \nThe internet may not have geographical boundaries, but psychological boundaries follow us online. \nWhen seeking a romantic partner, whether online or offline, people gravitate toward others who are similar and familiar to them \u2013 not people whom they have been taught to see as fundamentally different from their family, friends and neighbors.\nAttraction is complicated, and race might always play a role in whom people choose to bring into their bedrooms and family. But I think that people should be concerned by the role that these discriminatory laws continue to play in their intimate lives, especially when it reproduces racial inequality.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Online dating, School segregation, Dating website, Anti-discrimination laws, immigration laws, Dating apps, Immigration reform, Dating life, Dating profiles, immigration quotas, dating app industry","role":"assistant"}]}

That should not be surprising. \nBut what is surprising is our companion finding: Democrats and Republicans who live in those same communities have views on gun violence and gun regulations that line up more closely with their party leaders\u2019 views than with the experiences of their daily lives.\nThe same is true for other significant political questions: Independents\u2019 political views and perspectives on key issues also reflect the economic and social conditions they see and experience every day. \nIn contrast, Democrats\u2019 and Republicans\u2019 ideas of what problems deserve government attention and how to solve them are much less likely to be based on their own life experiences, and instead simply mirror the information they have gained from leading political figures on social media, on cable news networks or through other partisan information outlets. \n\n\n\n\n\nBeing independent is desirable\nThe United States\u2019 two-party system means the political party that controls the government is more of an influence on what laws and policies get passed than just about any other factor. Yet, Americans strongly dislike political parties. Being politically independent is a large part of the American political DNA. \nBeing politically independent, indeed, is seen by most Americans as a desirable social attribute. Broadly, many Americans see eschewing party identification as a way to demonstrate that they are freethinkers, untethered to the restrictive confines of America\u2019s two-party system and above the political fray. \nHowever, when pressed, most people admit to preferring, and largely voting for, one of the two political parties. Only about one-fifth of Americans are so independent that they do not vote consistently for one party or the other.\n\nHow political independents decide\nWe collected a series of national surveys of Americans over the last 10 years and have repeatedly found that only independents are responsive to the information they gain through their lived experience.\nFor example, we found that an independent living in a neighborhood with the highest levels of gun violence in the U.S. is 70 percentage points more likely to say that they are very concerned about gun violence than an independent who lives in the safest U.S. neighborhood. That makes sense. \nBut for Democrats and Republicans, there is no relationship between where they live and their level of concern about gun violence: Whether they live in a relatively dangerous community or a relatively safe one, their views on gun violence reflect their party\u2019s messages on the issue.\nSimilarly, we found that independents\u2019 personal financial situations factor greatly into their views on policies like the minimum wage and affordable housing. Independents who struggle to afford their basic essentials are almost twice as likely to support government investment in affordable housing in their neighborhoods and more than twice as likely to support increasing the minimum wage than independents who never struggle to afford their basic needs.\n\nFor Republicans and Democrats, their personal financial situations don\u2019t influence their policy views \u2013 only the party they associate with matters. On average, Republicans and Democrats who regularly struggle to afford basic essentials have the same views on affordable housing and the minimum wage as their fellow party members who never face financial stress.\nThough there is a lot of research documenting the growing polarization and nationalization of American politics, our research indicates that some politics is still local and personal, rooted in communities and people\u2019s own life experiences \u2013 but only among political independents.\nBut that\u2019s only about 20% of the nation\u2019s electorate, though it varies considerably by state. Our research indicates that the remaining 80% may still walk around their communities, talk with their neighbors and pay their bills \u2013 but they are less likely to use those experiences to determine their political preferences and decisions.\nInstead, they\u2019re paying more attention to the strategic, partisan information streaming from their phones, computers, televisions and radios about what partisan elites have decided they should think and prioritize.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Party politics, US politics, Democratic Party, Republican Party, Independents, Socio-economic conditions, US gun violence, Independent voters","role":"assistant"}]}

In Amerika (1911 to 1914), set in an era of early 20th-century free-market enterprise, Kafka portrays the gruelling consequences of overwork on desperate people.\nReminiscent of the menial graft in Victorian classic David Copperfield, in one scene an exhausted labourer is crushed by falling bricks in front of her child. Later, a disabled woman imprisoned in her bedroom must rely on her lodgers to care for her. With near-Dickensian irony, their board is paid not with money but by this inadequate round-the-clock care.\nCommemorating 100 years since Kafka\u2019s death, many are revisiting his stories. A focus on how disabled bodies relate to the workplace brings a new appreciation of his fiction, as well as both his professional and personal life.\nThis means examining experiences of disability, which often involve hostility, accusations of laziness, and an acknowledgement of the desperation faced by people who lack meaningful support. This is wrought raw in Kafka\u2019s work as his characters struggle against systems that actively prevaricate, disregard and ignore them. \n\n\n\n\n\nPoignantly, in these stories we encounter characters who embody urgent concerns of today. For instance, A Country Doctor (1917) struggles against limited resources that result in his failure to save a wounded child\u2019s life, while The Hunger Artist (1922) starves himself to death inside a cage for the entertainment of passersby.\n\n\nThis article is part of our series marking 100 years since the death of writer Franz Kafka. These articles explore his legacy and influence on everything from cinema to law. To read more, click here\n\nCountless times, Kafka places disabled bodies in opposition to modernity\u2019s unjust and arbitrary demands. He emphasises the material conditions by which we are forced to live and die: an impoverished welfare state, reduced medical care, a person\u2019s suffering as spectacle.\nThis literary preoccupation is partly informed by real life. Kafka witnessed countless pressures on disabled people in his professional career at The Workers\u2019 Accident Insurance Institute in Prague.\nThe biographer Reiner Stach imagines Kafka arriving at his office \u201cto speak to disabled accident victims or comfort bereaved family members\u201d. Stach also provides literature commonly circulated around Kafka\u2019s workplace, giving us a grim insight of the \u201cuses for the disabled\u201d throughout the Hapsburg Empire. \n\nDer Arbeitnachweis (Legal Regulation of Public Employment Offices in Austria, 1915) includes a section for hairdressers in which \u201cfacial disfigurement and the wearing of eyeglasses constitute an inability to work, because the sight of wounded or disfigured hairdressers\u2019 assistants drives away customers\u201d. \nThat a \u201cdisfigured\u201d, bespectacled assistant should be rejected from employment in a hairdressing salon is a decision based purely on physical appearance \u2013 bodily differences dictate employment or social exclusion. Meanwhile, in another section for carpenters, \u201cmissing an eye or the jaw is not an impediment\u201d. \n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Kafka 100: Stanley Kubrick's films are littered with references to the writer's work\n\n\n\n\nThis arbitrary decision-making and nightmarish bureaucracy, which disregards some but accepts others, has come to be known as Kafkaesque. It chimes troublingly with Ellen Clifford\u2019s 2020 description in The War on Disabled People of institutional oppression against those undergoing the trial of work capabilities assessments. \nStill today, the UK government scheme which decides eligibility for disability benefit is criticised as punitive and degrading. Its approach is deeply suspicious of those needing support, casting prospective claimants, like characters from a Kafka story, as trying to beat the system. The box-ticking format is poorly designed and does not accommodate the lived experiences of those people being processed.\n\nOutside the office, Kafka\u2019s hometown was founded on stories about disability and work. In Prague Pictures, Irish novelist John Banville recounts the story of Prague\u2019s medieval astronomical clock, the Orloj. It was built by a master clockmaker \u201cwho did such a fine job that the town councillors, fearful he would make a replica elsewhere, had the unfortunate craftsman blinded\u201d. This violent irony is a Kafkaesque conceit: someone so gifted in their work that they are punished for their skill.\nPersonally, Kafka was familiar with impairment.\nIn his family\u2019s business ventures, there was the risk of ill health. Along with his father and brother-in-law, Franz became a shareholder in Prague\u2019s first asbestos factory. Although there was little awareness of how carcinogens affected the body, his stories\u2019 preoccupation with breathing problems and the tuberculosis from which he would eventually die indicate the disabling effects of industrialisation.\nConsumption finally took away Kafka\u2019s ability to speak in his last weeks, but he persevered and diligently wrote Josephine the Singer (1924), a story about a mouse who is excused from physical labour and who sings without a voice.\nDespite her silence, and maybe because of it, the mouse\u2019s audience remains spellbound, her curious art outlasting the body that produced it. This parallels Kafka, whose tales of bodies and work remain relevant to a captivated readership a century after his death.\n<\/if\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Literature, Work, Disability, Books, Give me perspective, Kafka 100","role":"assistant"}]}

The war in the Pacific had not yet ended. Larger ceremonies involving dignitaries followed in the 1950s and 1960s. \nHowever, historians highlight 1984 as the year major anniversary commemorations became diplomatic events. France invited heads of state to attend the proceedings in Normandy, and connections were made between the historic events being remembered and the geopolitics of the present. \nThe 2024 ceremonies are no different. While veterans have been placed front and centre, especially as their numbers are sadly declining, heads of state are using the anniversary to address the challenges and concerns facing the world today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD-day during the cold war\nIn the immediate post-1945 period, the first memorials and monuments to the D-day landings started to go up in Normandy. The French government sponsored a vast commemorative project, the Voie de la Libert\u00e9, which marked the route taken by the allied armies as they battled their way through France. \nAuthorities in the US and Britain similarly invested in the memory of D-day. Their commemorative organisations, respectively the American Battle Monuments Commission (the ABMC), and the Imperial (now Commonwealth) War Graves Commission, played key roles. \nThe largest British war cemetery at Bayeux, in Normandy, was completed in 1952. The ABMC\u2019s Normandy American Cemetery, which would be made famous by the opening scenes of the 1998 movie, Saving Private Ryan, followed in 1956. These sacred sites quickly became locations for solemn remembrance, particularly during anniversary commemorations. \nBut such commemorations also provided an invaluable opportunity to use the past to make statements about the present, something often called \u201cmemory diplomacy\u201d. \nOne issue loomed especially large in this period: the continued importance of allied unity in the face of what western leaders perceived to be Soviet aggression, particularly after events such as the Berlin blockade, from 1948-49. \n\nThis dual feature of a D-day anniversary \u2013 solemn remembrance inflected by cold war politics \u2013 was certainly apparent during the tenth anniversary in 1954. It saw allied veterans return to dedicate memorials and visit the graves of their comrades. But also in attendance were French president Ren\u00e9 Coty as well as the Nato Supreme Allied Commander Europe, Gen Alfred Gruenther. \nThe event had a similar tone during the 20th anniversary in 1964, although French president Charles De Gaulle, in contrast to Coty, famously refused to be present in Normandy. De Gaulle felt the ceremonies gave too much space to the Americans and British, allies with whom he had various disagreements.\nD-day and diplomacy\nIt was during the 40th anniversary in June 1984 that the shape of modern D-day commemoration finally emerged. Cold war tensions were again rising, with the US and Soviet Union locked into a new arms race, and the French president, Francois Mitterand, was keen to demonstrate European leadership. He invited several heads of state to the events in Normandy, including US president Ronald Reagan and Queen Elizabeth II of the UK. \n\nJune 1984 was also an important moment for veterans. Forty years had passed since the landings. Many had retired, and they now returned to Normandy in their thousands. \nVeterans were a particularly noticeable presence at some of the key ceremonies. At Pointe du Hoc, scene of an important D-day battle,  Reagan gave a celebrated speech asserting the continued vitality of the transatlantic alliance. Here, in Normandy, said Reagan, \u201cthe Allies stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history\u201d. \nA decade later, during the 50th anniversary, heads of state again joined large numbers of allied veterans. The cold war was now over, and the west victorious. There was a noticeable air of celebration.\nBy the early 21st century, the basic format of a major D-day anniversary was in place. These were occasions for poignant remembrance often involving the tearful reunions of veterans. But they had also become high profile international diplomatic events during which presidents and prime ministers gave speeches honouring the past with an eye on the present. \nIn June 2004, the speech given by President George W. Bush in the Normandy American Cemetery was shaped in part by the circumstances of the contemporary \u201cwar on terror\u201d which saw the US lead invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. Towards the end of the speech Bush declared: \u201cThe nations that battled across the continent would become trusted partners in the cause of peace. And our great alliance of freedom is strong, and it is still needed today.\u201d\n\nTen years later, in 2014, it was President Barack Obama\u2019s turn. Clearly conscious of the recent Russian annexation of Crimea, Obama said: \u201cWe come to remember why America and our allies gave so much for the survival of liberty at its moment of maximum peril.\u201d \nThe diplomatic value of a D-day anniversary was highlighted by the guest list that year: Russian president Vladimir Putin was in attendance. Putin had previously been invited to the 60th anniversary in 2004, as had Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, the first German leader to attend a D-day anniversary.\nD-day 80 rightly turns our attention back to the past, and to the courageous endeavour of that grey June morning in 1944. But with Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, very deliberately in attendance this year at the invitation of President Macron of France \u2013 and with Putin noticeably absent \u2013 we will also be invited to ponder how the memory of June 6 might help guide us through the challenges of today.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"World War II, D-Day, Educate me","role":"assistant"}]}

[\u2026] We\u2019ll look at the prevailing economic conditions after the next election, and we\u2019ll make announcements in due course.\u201d He said the progress to the 2050 target did not need to be linear. \nAustralia already has a 2030 target under the Paris agreement \u2013 set by the Albanese government \u2013 of reducing emissions by 43% (on 2005 levels). It has to submit a target for 2035 early next year.\nDutton last week said Australia\u2019s 2030 target was unachievable, in \u00a0comments that prompted speculation that a Coalition government would seek to leave the Paris agreement. While scotching that, Dutton\u2019s latest remarks put more doubt over what would be the Coalition\u2019s policy. \nLiberal moderate senator Andrew Bragg danced around the issue when questioned on Sky about Dutton\u2019s position. \u201cMost people who look at this closely will look for two key points. Are you in Paris? And are you in for net zero 2050? And the answer to both questions is yes. The rest is noise,\u201d Bragg said. He also said, \u201cwhat we do for 2040 and the other years in between 2050 \u2013 that will be announced, I\u2019m sure, before the election\u201d. \nAlbanese said Dutton\u2019s position would leave Australia standing with Libya, Yemen and Iran. \u201cThat is not the company that Australia should want to keep. \n\"We know that the consequences of that for our relationships in our region and around the world with our closest allies will be ones that are regrettable, to say the least.\u201d\nPointing to Bragg\u2019s rather different position, Albanese said it was clear there hadn\u2019t been any proper process to determine the Coalition\u2019s policy. He said instead of chasing new investment in new industries \u00a0with new opportunities and new jobs, Dutton was chasing them away. \u201cPeter Dutton is afraid of the future, \u00a0and therefore he cannot seize the opportunities \u00a0which are there.\u201d\nThe teal MPs continue to seize on Dutton\u2019s hardening climate position to attack him. \nKylea Tink, MP for North Sydney, said Dutton\u2019s plan to ditch Australia\u2019s current 2030 target \u201cis bordering on criminal\u201d. \n\u201cThe dangerous captain\u2019s call [\u2026] would see a Coalition government effectively pull Australia out of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\"Peter Dutton\u2019s promise to renege on Australia\u2019s 2030 climate targets is anti-science, anti-jobs and anti-climate action.\n\"Reneging on our 2030 target will leave Australia a pariah on the international stage, and will result in higher energy bills for Australian families and businesses, the loss of thousands of future-ready jobs, threaten our economy and ultimately lead to higher climate pollution,\u201d Tink said.\nDutton was dismissive of the teals. \u201cSome of the teals \u2013 Monique Ryan and Sophie Scamps \u2013 they will vote with Labor because they\u2019re Greens, they\u2019re not teals,\u201d he said. \nThe Australian Industry Group on Tuesday cast doubt on whether the 2030 target would be met. \n\u201cWe have supported Australia\u2019s interim emissions targets as a guide path and glide path to meeting the global Paris Agreement goal to limit further climate change,\u201d Ai\u2019s CEO Innes Willox said.\n\u201cAustralia\u2019s current 2030 target is in the balance \u2013 we are tracking in broadly the right direction and we have the tools to get it done, but it\u2019s looking more unlikely that Australia will build the new assets we need fast enough to meet the full 43% by 2030,\u201d Willox said. \nTasmanian federal Liberal to bail out at election\nDutton has suffered a blow in Tasmania. Differences between the Liberals\u2019 two Tasmanian federal MPs have ended with one, Gavin Pearce, the member for Braddon, carrying through his threat not to recontest his seat. \nLast year Pearce was reported as telling colleagues he was withholding his nomination for the seat to force the party to block Bridget Archer from recontesting the adjoining seat of Bass.\n\nArcher, a prominent and outspoken moderate, has been critical of a number of opposition positions and has frequently crossed the floor. But Dutton has given her licence, not wanting to risk her defecting to the crossbench. \nPearce said in a statement he had decided not to recontest \u201cfollowing much deliberation and consideration\u201d. He made no mention of his political differences with Archer. Pearce has held Braddon since 2019. The seat is on an 8% margin and he received a substantial positive swing in 2022. \nMeanwhile the Sydney Morning Herald reports New South Wales senator Hollie Hughes has lashed out at shadow treasurer Angus Taylor, blaming him for her loss in the recent Senate preselection, when she failed to secure a winnable place on the ticket. \nTaylor, from the conservative faction, provided a reference for conservative candidate Jessica Collins. Andrew Bragg, a moderate, will head the ticket and Collins has a winnable spot.\n\u201cThis is a message to colleagues that some people\u2019s ambition is more focused on themselves rather than the betterment of the team,\u201d Hughes said.\nPremier Li Qiang\u2019s arrives in Australia this weekend\nChinese Premier Li Qiang will visit Australia from Saturday to Tuesday, in the first visit by a Chinese premier since 2017.\nPrime Minister Albanese and Premier Li will hold the Annual Leaders\u2019 Meeting in Canberra; Premier Li will also go to Adelaide and Perth. The visit will include Albanese and Li meeting with Australian and Chinese business leaders, and a community event to mark the contribution of the more than one million members of the Chinese-Australian community.\nAlbanese visited China late last year.\n\nAsked at his news conference what his message to Li would be about incidents involving the Australian military in the South China Sea and elsewhere, Albanese said the message would be that they were \u201cinappropriate\u201d. He said Li would be \u201cvery aware of Australia\u2019s position, which is that Australia was engaged in legitimate international activity.\u201d \nLate last year, the Chinese used sonar against Australian navy divers. This year, flares were deployed in the path of an Australian navy helicopter.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, China, Peter Dutton, Paris Agreement, Climate wars, 2030 targets, Australian Election 2025","role":"assistant"}]}

The United States National Forest Foundation even borrowed the term to kick off its 2024 Instagram account. Girl mossing recognises a need to step away from the pressures of modern, urban life, promoting spending time in nature as a restorative practice. \nThe fast pace and pressure of neoliberal capitalism take an enormous toll on wellbeing: not just personal, but social and planetary. These pressures are most acutely felt by women \u2013 whose labour remains, in large part, undervalued and underpaid \u2013 and by young people, who are often in precarious work, priced out of the housing market. Yet they\u2019re still bombarded with images of unattainable success on social media. Not so the moss selfies.\n\nThe pressure to succeed, to be a \u201cgirlboss\u201d at work, as well as the perfect girlfriend or wife or mother or daughter, takes its toll on women\u2019s physical and emotional health. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that women are moving from girlbossing to girl mossing.\nGirl rotting is another subversive form of rest and retreat, focused on being intentionally \u201cunproductive\u201d at home. \nWhile it is challenging to pinpoint the origins and scope of this aesthetic movement, \u201cgirl mossing\u201d, \u201cgirl rotting\u201d, and related terms have seen significant growth on social media since around the middle of last year.  The trend can be traced back to mid-2022, when journalist and influencer Daisy Alioto tweeted: \u201cThe girl boss is dead, long live the girl moss (lying on the floor of the forest and being absorbed back into nature).\u201d \nHer tweet was picked up by other influencers and the term spread to  lifestyle and wellness blogs and the popular media.\n\nThere is a crossover between girl mossing as a byword for resting and relaxing in nature, and a worldwide trend for literally appreciating moss, similarly linked to finding relaxation in nature. In Japan, moss has long been a national craze, sparked partly by a 2011 runaway hit book, Mosses, My Dear Friends. The term \u201cMoss girl(s)\u201d in Japanese, #\u82d4\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb or #\u82d4\u30ac\u30fc\u30eb\u30ba, has 4,036 posts on Instagram.\nOn Facebook, the Moss Appreciation Society has over 267.1k members. And there are whole Instagram accounts devoted to photos of moss, like Mossgirlny, with 14.9K followers.\n\nMoss does not move fast. It is soft and pillowy, ideal for nestling into, and plays a nurturing role in soil health, helping retain key nutrients, avoid erosion, and ward off disease. It also helps with decomposition, transforming decaying leaf matter into new life.\nRetreats for \u201cmoss girls\u201d in Japan are accompanied by moss discovery tours and special themed desserts. The moss obsession continues today, with Oprah Winfrey recently getting in on the trend, visiting the moss gardens in Saihoji Temple and \u201cforest bathing\u201d.   \nRest, repair and doing nothing\nThe girl moss phenomenon also provides evidence for the rise in popularity of what scholars have called Dark Green Religion, reverential naturalism or relational naturalism. A strong connection with nature and an awareness of our interdependence with it is becoming a prevalent worldview and a source of meaning for many. It can have spiritual dimensions, or be entirely materialist and scientific.\nThis connection with nature is frequently coupled with the desire for rest and repair, in contrast to (and representing recovery from) the speed of capitalist hustle culture. \n\nTrends like girl mossing and girl rotting follow the recent trend of quiet quitting, rising interest in the Dutch concept of niksen (doing nothing), and Dzogchen Buddhism\u2019s emphasis on resting in effortless ease.\nIn China, there\u2019s a parallel rise in \u201ctangping\/lying flat\u201d among Chinese young people who are \u201crejecting high-pressure jobs\u201d in favour of a \u201clow-pressure life\u201d, and in \u201cbai lan\u201d (letting things rot), \u201ca voluntary retreat\u201d from pursuing goals that are now seen as \u201ctoo difficult to achieve\u201d. \nNotably, these trends emerged as we reentered the productivity culture of contemporary working life after the lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic, when much of the world was forced to slow down. Perhaps we\u2019ve learnt the wisdom of letting things moss and rot. \nAs Buddhist nun and bestselling author Pema Ch\u00f6dr\u00f6n states, things \u201ccome together and they fall apart\u201d, again and again. \u201cIt\u2019s just like that.\u201d\nThe Western, capitalist mindset \u2013 shaped by Protestant values \u2013 valorises \u201cthings coming together\u201d. We typically strive for material rewards through hard work and achieve success through doing. \nWe celebrate the \u201cwins\u201d: the promotion, the new house, marriage, the birth of children. By contrast, we really struggle \u201cwhen things fall apart\u201d, as they inevitably do, particularly when we are confronted with old age, sickness, and death \u2013 basically, with human decomposition.\n\nMossing and rotting trends are by no means the first spiritual or lifestyle movements out to subvert the prescribed capitalist life path. \nIn the 1960s, leading figure in the counterculture movement and psychedelics advocate Timothy Leary urged youth to \u201ctune in, turn on, drop out\u201d. But girl mossing and girl rotting are distinguished by being led by young women, and by their embrace of natural rhythms of decay.\nThey both resist the hustle of productivity culture through an awareness that humans are part of nature \u2013\u00a0and thus subject to natural cycles. This fundamentally includes decomposition. \nThere is overlap, here, with the women leading the natural death and home funeral movement, such as author Caitlin Doughty, who advocate for embracing decay and the \u201cfreedom found in decomposition, a body rendered messy, chaotic, and wild\u201d. And for advocates of new methods of handling human remains, like composting, decomposition is a fundamentally generative act, productive of new life. \nWe cannot simply go, go, go and incessantly produce and consume. We also need to rest, and rot, to rejuvenate for our wellbeing \u2013 and at some point, to die well too.\n\nThis article is part of a series The Conversation is running on Religion and Spirituality.

In Australia, this equal population per seat is possible for a particular state or territory\u2019s seats, but not for all seats in the House of Representatives.\nABC election analyst Antony Green said in June 2023 that all original states are entitled to at least five House seats, so Tasmania has five seats even though its population should only give it three.\nRedistributions are needed when the population of a state increases or decreases relative to the overall Australian population, such that the state is entitled to either add a seat, or a seat is removed from that state.\nA year after the first sitting of parliament following an election, the electoral commission determines state seat entitlements based on the latest available population data.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn June 2023, the Australian Bureau of Statistics published population estimates nationally and for all states.  Green said these population estimates would require the loss of a seat in both Victoria and New South Wales, while Western Australia would gain a seat.  The overall size of the House would fall from 151 to 150 seats since the 2022 election. \nThese changes occurred because, relative to Australia\u2019s overall population, Victoria and NSW\u2019s population decreased, mainly due to the COVID immigration shutdowns.  WA\u2019s population increased relative to Australia.\nWhen states are to lose seats, lower-enrolment seats within that state are targeted for axing.  States that gain seats have the new seat created in a high-enrolment area.  Axing or creating seats causes knock-on effects to existing seats, which either have to absorb the axed seats, or pull back from created seats.\nRedistributions also take place in states that haven\u2019t had a change in House seat numbers for at least seven years, to correct inequalities in population dispersion within that state.  There is currently a redistribution in progress for the Northern Territory, which has had two seats for a long time.\nChanges from the Victorian, NSW and WA redistributions\nThe determination of state seat entitlements began the redistribution process in Victoria, NSW and WA.  On May 31, the electoral commission released draft redistributions for Victoria and WA, and on June 14 the NSW draft redistribution was released.  I covered the Victorian and WA redistributions on May 31 and the NSW redistribution on June 17.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese redistributions are drafts, and it is expected to take a few more months before they are finalised.  Changes can occur from the draft redistributions to the final ones.  Until finalisation, redistributions cannot be used at an election.\n\n\n\nIn Victoria, the Labor-held seat of Higgins was abolished, while the new seat of Bullwinkel was created in WA.  In NSW, North Sydney, held by teal independent Kylea Tink, was abolished. This means that unless MPs in abolished seats can win a different seat or become a senator, they will not be in the next parliament.\nUsing booth data, election analysts are able to estimate new margins for seats after a redistribution.  Sometimes this results in a seat currently held by one party becoming a notional seat for another party.  For example, a marginal Liberal-held seat may now include strong Labor booths that were previously in another seat, so it becomes a notional Labor seat.\nAccording to estimates from William Bowe (The Poll Bludger), the newly created WA seat of Bullwinkel is notionally Labor by a 52.9\u201347.1 margin against the Liberals.  All other WA seats will be held by their previous party, with the biggest change a 4.7-point lift in Labor\u2019s Hasluck margin to 60.7\u201339.3.\n\n\n\nHowever, I previously wrote that Labor would be worried about a large swing to the Coalition in WA, as WA has been historically weak for Labor but had over a 10% swing to Labor to be Labor\u2019s best state at the 2022 federal election.  If there is a large swing to the Coalition at the next election, Bullwinkel and Tangney (also on a 52.9\u201347.1 Labor margin) are vulnerable.\nIn Victoria, while Labor-held Higgins was abolished, Liberal-held Menzies will be notionally Labor by 50.7\u201349.3 after Labor gained 1.3 points, and the Liberal-held Deakin lineball at 50.0\u201350.0 after Labor gained 0.2 points. But Labor\u2019s margin in Chisholm was reduced to 52.8\u201347.2, a 3.6-point swing to the Liberals.\nTeal independent-held seats of Goldstein and Kooyong now take in areas that did not have a teal candidate at the previous election.  The Poll Bludger\u2019s estimates imply that Kooyong (held by Monique Ryan) will be harder for the teal to retain than Goldstein (held by Zoe Daniel).\nIn NSW, Tink\u2019s North Sydney was abolished.  The Poll Bludger\u2019s estimates say Bennelong was the only change in notional party alignment, with a 1.1% swing to the Liberals barely putting them ahead of Labor. In Bradfield, the Liberal margin over a teal independent was reduced to 52.5\u201347.5, a 1.8-point swing to a teal. The Liberal-held Hughes swung 3.7 points to Labor, with the Liberals still ahead by 53.3\u201346.7.\nThe redistribution\u2019s impact on the next election\nI don\u2019t think the changes to the electoral map will have a major impact on the next election, due by May 2025.  If Labor loses, it\u2019s likely that anger over the continued high cost of living will be far more important than the redistributions.\nAnalyst Kevin Bonham, using the draft redistributions, said his seat model would give Labor 79 of the now 150 House of Representatives seats if there was no two-party swing from the 2022 election, which Labor won by 52.1\u201347.9. This would be a one-seat gain for Labor from the current House.\nAssuming no changes to the crossbench, Labor would have an even chance of retaining its majority with a 51.1\u201348.9 national two-party win, about where polls are now. The Coalition would need a 51.3\u201348.7 two-party split in its favour to win more seats than Labor, and a 53.4\u201346.6 split to win a majority.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"AEC, Australian parliament, Australian House of Representatives","role":"assistant"}]}

Over the past eight months, university students have set up encampments at dozens of universities in Europe and North America. In most cases, they are protesting their university\u2019s financial ties to Israeli companies and universities.\nUniversities have long been considered \u201chotbeds\u201d of protest. Research has found a correlation between the number of universities in an area and higher overall levels of protest activity, suggesting that they are indeed fertile ground for activism. \nFree speech and academic freedom are a key part of how universities operate. But they also have to deliver education and protect students and staff from harassment. The balance can be delicate. \nUniversity leaders have struggled with how to respond to the latest round of protests. Some, like at Trinity College Dublin, have agreed to protesters\u2019 demands to divest from Israeli companies. Protesters at the University of Cambridge agreed to move after university leaders said they would negotiate. \n\n\n\n\n\nIn May, the University of Birmingham issued a notice to quit to protesting students, indicating they had trespassed and threatening to call the police. Days later, 16 Oxford students were arrested under public order legislation after entering and seeking to occupy the vice chancellor\u2019s office.\nUS universities have taken a more aggressive approach, calling for police intervention to clear encampments. More than 2,100 arrests have been made, and police have employed militarised tactics, including the use of tear gas, rubber bullets and other violent techniques to break up protests. \nThese were unacceptably disproportionate responses to what was mostly peaceful protest. Many suppose that such scenes would not happen in the UK. But in fact, UK law gives police incredibly potent powers to deal with public protest, with recent legislation being the most extreme.\n\n\n\n\n      Read more:\n      Policing bill is now law: how your right to protest has changed\n\n\n\n\nThe disjointed response to protest so far may owe something to the mess of complex and novel legislation and case law. The political context also raises questions about the law and policy on harassment and discrimination, especially as it relates to the question of antisemitism. \nThis is why we, as scholars of constitutional law and protest, have set out our views on how these protests should be handled. Both of us have worked in advisory capacity with parliamentary select committees dealing with constitutional and human rights questions. One of us (Jeff) chaired a university academic board working group on the definition of antisemitism, while David is (in his co-author\u2019s view) the leading scholar on protest law. \nWe have drafted a detailed set of principles setting out what we believe are fair terms for universities and students alike. These take into account existing law and policy, and ultimately aim to prevent harmful escalation without inhibiting the freedom of peaceful assembly.\nThe principles\nWhile the extended and detailed account can be read here, what follows is a high-level summary. The principles mostly detail relevant law, but in some cases also express our view of university best practice requires.\n\nStudents have the right to freedom of expression and of peaceful assembly and association, under Articles 10 and 11 of the European convention on human rights (ECHR). UK public universities are required to respect and secure those rights under the Human Rights Act 1998. These laws protect a freedom of peaceful protest even if it is disruptive or even offensive to some.\nThe freedom of expression and peaceful assembly extends to student occupations of buildings and other university spaces. This can even include lengthy ones that breach domestic law.\nCalls for boycott and divestment from companies implicated in human rights abuses is a common and protected form of civil rights advocacy, and is not in itself antisemitic.\nHuman rights law recognises that the right to protest may be restricted where it is necessary in a democratic society. A university has rights as a landowner, and contractual obligations to maintain its core educational functions, including fulfilment of the right to education under the ECHR.\nA tent encampment aimed at protesting a university\u2019s investment programme (and which limits noise and other disruptions from unduly interrupting revision, teaching, examining and other core educational functions) would fall within the sphere of protected speech and assembly. Universities must accommodate them.\nOn the other hand, universities and their students are not legally required to withstand a permanent and seriously disruptive occupation that brings campus life and activities to a halt. Protests that directly obstruct teaching and examining (for example, occupying a lecture theatre in the middle of teaching) to a major extent can be subject to legitimate restriction. \n\n\n\nProtesters can also, in some grave situations, be liable to criminal prosecution. For example, by using threatening or abusive language, or inciting racial or religious hatred, aggravated trespass or failure to comply with police directions. \nUniversities can restrict disruptive protesting to students and staff, and ask uninvited persons to leave. However, they should not exclude guests invited there for political discussion only. \nThe use of criminal law against students (for example, by calling the police) has grave consequences and will normally be a disproportionate act of escalation. UK statute and case law relating to the application of criminal law to public protest stands a significant chance of being found to violate the ECHR. Universities should not call the police where civil remedies (such as possession) are a suitable alternative.\nUniversities have a moral duty to ensure that campus is free of harassment and racism as defined under the Equality Act 2010, and that it is safe for all members of the university (and non-members legitimately present on campus). \nUniversities should record and investigate any complaints about harassment or discrimination arising within or from encampments. However, complaints alone are not a sound basis for policy. To amount to discrimination under equality law, complaints must be assessed and determined on an objective basis. \nProtesters should recognise the role of self-restraint and self-vigilance in respect of the university\u2019s educational mandate and duty to prevent harassment. \n\nWhat we want to see\nIn publishing these principles, we hope to clarify a university\u2019s powers to act, and students\u2019 rights to protest peacefully (but disruptively) within the bounds of  human rights law. \nWe hope universities will recognise and respect these principles. And we hope that protesters might gain a better understanding of when the law is and is not on their side \u2013 and where sympathies may fray. \nBut we also underline here that the law is only part of the picture. Whether or not a university can act is not the same as whether it should. Above all, it is crucial to remember that universities are unique, educational communities where political disagreement should be nourished, not quelled. \nJust as we, as academics, enjoy statutory protection of our academic freedom, we should expect universities to show tolerance toward students as they navigate the sometimes treacherous foothills of participatory democracy.\nThis piece has been updated to say that Trinity College Dublin, not University College Dublin, agreed to protesters\u2019 demands to divest from Israeli companies.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Gaza, UK universities, Give me perspective, Campus protests","role":"assistant"}]}

It all began with the discovery of ancient graffiti.\nThe shepherd\u2019s graffiti\nThe tiny work was found on a marble rock outcrop at Vari, 20km southeast of Athens. It is part of a larger group of more than 2,000 graffiti made by shepherds and goatherds, discovered and studied by Merle Langdon in recent years. They feature text as well as drawings that include ships, horses, and erotic scenes. They all date to the sixth century BCE.\nThe newly discovered work is a rough rock-cut drawing of a building. Though the details of the drawing are not fully understood, it can be identified as a temple due to the columns and steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSnaking around the building there is a Greek inscription reading To Hekatompedon \u2026 Mikonos (The 100-foot building \u2026 of Mikon). Mikon is not otherwise known, but he was most likely a shepherd who made the graffito while grazing his flocks. The version of the Greek alphabet used is very ancient, making it clear that the drawing was made as early as the 6th century BCE.\nOf great archaeological significance is the inscription\u2019s word Hekatompedon, a Greek name meaning \u201c100-footer\u201d, referring to a structure of enormous size. The term is known to be the official ancient name of the famous temple dedicated to the Greek goddess Athena \u2013 later known as the Parthenon.\nIt is likely that Mikon wanted to depict a building on the Acropolis of Athens. However, because the alphabet he used can be firmly dated to the 6th century BCE, the drawing must be at least 50 years older than the Parthenon, which was begun around 450 BCE.\nA lost Greek temple\nThe Parthenon may be a very ancient temple, but it was not the first. It has long been thought that even older temples formerly stood on the Acropolis \u2013 though archaeologists have fiercely debated their dates, appearance, and exact locations on the hill. There is also a historical calamity that impedes our understanding: in 480 BCE, during the Greek-Persian wars, a Persian army arrived in Athens and destroyed all the buildings that then stood on the Acropolis.\nIn fact, the Acropolis Museum in Athens is home to large broken sculptures portraying scenes of Greek myth, as well as bulls being devoured by lions. They were once part of temple decorations but were badly damaged, perhaps in the Persian attack of 480 BCE, if not before. Could one of the lost temples be the Hekatompedon drawn by Mikon?\n\nA temple for storing treasure\nA crucial part of the puzzle is an Ancient Greek democratic decree dating from the time before the Persian attack and the building of the Parthenon. This decree also mentions a Hekatompedon on the Acropolis, which was used for the somewhat ambiguous purpose of \u201ctreasure storage\u201d. The decree has been known for a long time, but archaeologists had debated what the Hekatompedon mentioned in it could have been.\nSome think the Hekatompedon mentioned in the decree was a temple, as Greek temples normally served as the storage of treasures offered to the gods. But many others argue that the word Hekatompedon cannot refer to a temple at all, and must have been an open courtyard on the Acropolis.\nThe newly published graffito of Mikon\u2019s drawing is significant. If Mikon called his drawn temple a Hekatompedon, then it is likely that the term Hekatompedon in the decree referred to a temple too. Indeed, the Parthenon that stands on the hill today was once called the Hekatompedon. \nEven though the Hekatompedon drawn by Mikon has disappeared, it is likely that some of the temple sculptures in the museum belong to it, as it once stood on the site where the Parthenon stands today.\nGraffiti shows shepherds\u2019 literacy\nThe inscription is also significant because it shows that, contrary to what is normally thought, shepherds could read and write, even at this early date when literacy in the Greek world was still spreading. Why the shepherds produced so many graffiti is not known \u2013 it may have simply been a form of escapism during the dull moments of their job.\nHowever, the graffito made by Mikon shows how a small scribble may be the key to tackling the historical riddles behind one the world\u2019s most iconic archaeological sites.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Ancient Greece, Acropolis, Athens, Greek history, The Conversation Europe","role":"assistant"}]}

On May 30, a US diplomat warned that Russia had launched a \u201cweapon into orbit\u201d, something Russia\u2019s deputy foreign minister, Sergey Ryabkov, branded as \u201cfake news\u201d. It follows on from accusations in recent months by US and Russian officials that both countries are attempting to place nuclear weapons in space.\nSuch action, if it is true, will contravene the UN\u2019s 1967 Outer Space Treaty, under which all parties agreed \u201cnot to place in orbit around the Earth any objects carrying nuclear weapons or any other kinds of weapons of mass destruction\u201d. The treaty is now ratified by 114 countries, including leading space powers such as the US, Russia, China, India, France, Japan and the UK.\nNews of possible nuclear weapons in space is concerning, especially at a time when the race to land and settle humans and exploit resources on the Moon, Mars and beyond has intensified. The potential weaponisation of space has raised fears among many that the freedom to explore and use outer space peacefully is being eroded.\nWeaponising space would not only be dangerous for world peace, it also threatens to hinder technological development on Earth. If the arms race in space escalates into a fully-fledged war, it could lead to the use of weapons that can destroy valuable assets such as satellites. This would disrupt our communications, navigation and other innovations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UN Security Council has become a battleground over how to control the rhetoric of space weaponisation and warfare. The security council is comprised of 15 countries, including five members with veto power, and is responsible for maintaining international peace and security.\nIn response to reports that Russia had developed an anti-satellite nuclear weapon to put in space, the US and Japan put forward a draft resolution in April 2024 calling on all countries to prevent an arms race in outer space. Russia vetoed the resolution, but said it was \u201cfirmly committed\u201d to the existing 1967 treaty. The veto prompted the US to question whether Moscow was hiding something.\nThen, in May 2024, Russia and China drafted a similar resolution that underscored the need to \u201cprevent the placement, threat or use of any weapons in outer space\u201d. This resolution received seven votes in favour and seven votes against. Hence, it failed to pass.\nWeaponising space\nMilitary interests, assets and personnel have always been at the forefront of exploring and using outer space. In fact, fears that the first satellites and humans to orbit Earth could give the Soviet Union a military and strategic advantage inspired the US to consider space an extension of the arms race during the cold war. \nFollowing a series of nuclear tests in outer space in the 1960s by both the US and the Soviet Union, a shared understanding of their destructiveness and threat to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere subsequently produced the Outer Space Treaty. But, although the treaty exclusively bans weapons of mass destruction in outer space, it leaves room for ambiguity regarding other forms of weapons. \nAs a consequence, the US and the Soviet Union tested several anti-satellite weapons both during and after the cold war. China and India have carried out missile tests against space satellites too, while the UK, France, Israel, Japan, North and South Korea, and Iran are also considered capable of developing anti-satellite weapons. \nIt was only in 2022 that the US became the first country to announce a ban on such missile tests, saying they were reckless. The tests create space debris, which pose a risk to active satellites and humans in orbit. \n\nThe weaponisation of space presents a significant threat to the inclusiveness and shared benefits of exploring and using outer space. Low-Earth orbit has become increasingly crowded, with an astronomical rise in the number of satellites launched both by established and emerging space nations. \nAccording to UN records, over 80 countries have together put nearly 18,450 objects into orbit since 1957. And no fewer than 15 African countries have orbited 58 satellites in the last three decades, with 100 satellites in different stages of production on the continent. These are significant investments driven by the desire for some degree of independence in access to space for socioeconomic development and security.\nIt is not only countries that share the benefits of space. The private sector is becoming increasingly involved in space activity. Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, for instance, has launched 6,500 Starlink satellites, of which 6,050 were still in orbit as of May 2024. This initiative aims to provide high-speed internet connections to remote and disconnected areas of the world.\nThat said, the collaboration between SpaceX\u2019s Starlink and the US Department of Defense, which supports the activities of the Ukrainian army in their conflict with Russia, makes them a potential target in the event of a Russian nuclear attack in space.\nThe threat posed by an arms race in space must be realised and addressed. Renewed cooperation among the world\u2019s leading powers and support for the UN framework are critical to guaranteeing the peaceful and inclusive exploration and use of outer space.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"United States, China, Soviet Union (USSR), Military, Russia, UN Security Council, Satellites, Cold War, Nuclear tests, Space race, Elon Musk, Space weapons, Arms race, nuclear arms race, Give me perspective","role":"assistant"}]}

And access to it is the key \u2013 for a host of reasons, not least transparency, human rights and electoral integrity. \nBut there\u2019s currently a massive international asymmetry in access to data. \nIn the European Union and the US, some progress has been made. For example, EU researchers studying risks have a legal right of access. In the US too, some companies have taken voluntary steps to improve access.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe situation is generally very different in the global south. \nThe value of data access can be seen vividly in the monitoring of social media during elections. South Africa is a case in point. A powerful \u201cbig data\u201d analysis was recently published about online attacks on women journalists there, raising the alarm about escalation around \u2013 and after \u2013 the election on 29 May. \nA number of groups working with data are attempting to monitor hate speech and disinformation on social media ahead of South Africa\u2019s national and provincial polls. At a recent workshop involving 10 of these initiatives, participants described trying to detect co-ordinated \u201cinformation operations\u201d that could harm the election, including via foreign interference. \nBut these researchers can\u2019t get all the data they need because the tech companies don\u2019t give them access. \nThis has been a concern of mine since I first commissioned a handbook about harmful online content \u2013 Journalism, Fake News & Disinformation: Handbook for Journalism Education and Training \u2013 six years ago. My experience since then includes overseeing a major UN study called Balancing Act: Countering Digital Disinformation While Respecting Freedom of Expression.   \nOver the years, I\u2019ve learnt that to dig into online disinformation, you need to get right inside the social media engines. Without comprehensive access to the data they hold, you\u2019re left in relative darkness about the  workings of manipulators, the role of misled punters and the fuel provided by mysterious corporate algorithms. \nMonitoring\nLooking at social media in the South African elections, the researchers at the recent workshop shared how they were doing their best with what limited data they had. They were all monitoring text on social platforms. Some were monitoring audio, while a few were looking at \u201csynthetic content\u201d such as material produced with generative AI.  \nAbout half of 10 initiatives were tracking followers, impressions and engagement. Nearly all were checking content on Twitter; at least four were monitoring Facebook;  three covered YouTube; and two included TikTok. \nWhatsApp was getting scant attention. Though most messaging on the service is encrypted, the company knows (but doesn\u2019t disclose) which registered user is bulk sending content to which others, who forwards this on, whether group admins are active or not, and a host of other \u201cmetadata\u201d details that could help monitors to track dangerous trajectories.  \nBut the researchers can\u2019t do the necessary deep data dives. They\u2019ve set out the difficult data conditions they work under in a public statement explaining how they are severely constrained in their access to data.\nOne data source they use is expensive (and limited) packages from marketing brokers (who in turn have purchased data assets wholesale from the platforms). \nA second source is from analysing published posts online (which excludes in-group and WhatsApp communications).  Using scraped data is limited and labour-intensive. Findings are superficial. And it\u2019s risky: scraping is forbidden in most platforms\u2019 terms of use. \nNone of the researchers covering South Africa\u2019s elections have direct access to the platforms\u2019 own Application Programme Interfaces (APIs). These gateways provide a direct pipeline into the computer servers hosting data. This major resource is what companies use to profile users, amplify content, target ads and automate content moderation. It\u2019s an essential input for monitoring online electoral harms.   \nIn the EU, the Digital Services Act enables vetted researchers to legally demand and receive free, and potentially wide-ranging, API access to search for \u201csystemic risks\u201d on the platforms. \nIt\u2019s also more open in the US. There, Meta, the multinational technology giant that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, cherrypicked 16 researchers in the 2020 elections (of which only five projects have published their findings). The company has subsequently outsourced the judging of Facebook and Instagram access requests (from anywhere worldwide) to the University of Michigan. \nOne of the South African researchers tried that channel, without success. \nOther platforms such as TikTok are still making unilateral decisions, even in the US, as to who has data access. \nOutside the EU and the US, it\u2019s hard even to get a dialogue going with the platforms.\nThe fightback\nLast November, I invited the bigger tech players to join a workshop in Cape Town on data access and elections in Africa. There was effectively no response.  \nThe same pattern is evident in an initiative earlier this year by the South African National Editors\u2019 Forum. The forum suggested a dialogue around a human rights impact assessment of online risks to the South African elections. They were ignored.\nAgainst this background, two South African NGOs \u2013 the Legal Resources Centre and the Campaign for Free Expression \u2013 are using South Africa\u2019s expansive Promotion of Access to Information Act to compel platforms to disclose their election plans.  \nBut the  companies have refused to respond, claiming that they do not fall under South African jurisdiction. This has led to appeals being launched to the country\u2019s Information Regulator to compel disclosures. \nFurther momentum for change may also come from Unesco, which is promoting international Guidelines for the Governance of Digital Platforms. These highlight transparency and the issue of research access. Unesco has also published a report that I researched titled Data Sharing to Foster Information as a Public Good. \nIn the works is an incipient African Alliance for Access to Data, now involving five pan-African formations. This coalition (I\u2019m interim convenor) is engaging the African Union on the issues. \nBut there\u2019s no guarantee yet that all this will lead the platforms to open up data to Africans and researchers in the global south.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Social media, Africa, Big data, South Africa, Hate speech, Peace and Security, Disinformation, Big tech, Online attacks, Meta, South Africa election 2024","role":"assistant"}]}

Take the feel-good life advice in Baz Luhrmann\u2019s song to a class that graduated 25 years ago. Only on a recent relisten did I realize it also captures one of the research-based strategies I teach for avoiding communication that backfires.\nThe tip is hiding in plain sight in the song\u2019s title, \u201cEverybody\u2019s Free (to Wear Sunscreen).\u201d Communication aimed at promoting a certain behavior can have the opposite effect when the message is perceived as a threat to individual autonomy.\n\nHealth campaigns frequently use strongly worded messages that end up backfiring. For example, strongly worded messages promoting dental flossing made people angry and more likely to resist flossing their teeth. Coercive alcohol prevention messages, with language like \u201cany reasonable person must acknowledge these conclusions,\u201d instead increased alcohol consumption. In contrast, the wording of the title \u201cEverybody\u2019s Free (to Wear Sunscreen)\u201d is less likely to backfire by emphasizing liberty of choice.  \nResearch reveals lots of reasons why well-meaning attempts to inform, persuade or correct misinformation go awry. Despite the ubiquity of backfires, formal instruction about why they happen and how to avoid them is rare. The omission inspired my new book, \u201cBeyond the Sage on the Stage: Communicating Science and Contemporary Issues Effectively,\u201d which translates scholarship from across disciplines into practical strategies that anyone can use to improve communication.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen new info challenges your identity\nBackfires are often a response to communication of unwelcome information.\nIn addition to threats to autonomy, information can be unwelcome because it appears to conflict with how you think about yourself. Consider a study that asked people to read a message about genetically modified foods. Participants for whom purity, health and conscientiousness of their diet was an important part of how they defined themselves had more negative attitudes after reading a message intended to refute their views about GM food. Those who did not have a strong dietary self-concept did not react negatively to the message.\nThe same resistance can rise up when you\u2019re confronted with something counter to the beliefs of a group you feel a strong affiliation with. Emotional and identity attachment to a group such as a political party can cause people to subjugate their own values to align with the group, a phenomenon called cultural cognition. Reactions to messages about climate change often exemplify this phenomenon.\nAgainst the backdrop of protests and an impending election, communication breakdowns are increasingly blamed on political polarization, with more than a hint of fatalism. But the current heavy focus on ideological differences serves only to fuel a vicious cycle that amplifies them. To halt the cycle, the focus needs to shift away from the differences. Divides are not always what they seem, and even when they are, there are often ways to bridge them.\nEvery person contains multitudes\nEncouragingly, a study recently published by the Pew Research Center found that just 11% of Americans consider it very or extremely important that they get their news from journalists who share their political views. Less than 40% of Americans said that it was even somewhat important. The study is a reminder that we are all complex mixes of identities, and those distinct identities can offer fruitful starting points for a conversation.\n\nAs the various identities within people interact, the context can bring a particular identity to the fore. For example, a study that examined the importance of voters\u2019 identity as parents revealed that when thinking about their children, people were more willing to oppose the policies of their own political party. \u201cAnimal lover\u201d is another example of an identity that researchers have time and again seen relegate party identity to the background.\nTherefore, appealing to a shared identity is a strategy for bridging the divide.\nAnother strategy is to make it safe to go against the group without damaging an individual\u2019s connection to it. For example, people may act anonymously, which is what happened during the pandemic when some people reportedly chose to wear disguises when getting their COVID-19 vaccine.  \nAccidentally conveying what you don\u2019t mean\nAs in the case of threats to autonomy, the language you choose can minimize backfires caused by threats to group affiliations. People may agree that a proposed action is sound and consistent with their party\u2019s beliefs but still reject it if it contains even small polarizing cues. Triggers, such as words associated with the opposing party such as \u201ctax\u201d for a conservative or \u201cderegulation\u201d for a liberal, lead people to judge that their party would reject a policy. The fix is to remove both real and perceived threats to group identity by using party-neutral language.\nSurprisingly, communication need not be threatening or unwelcome to backfire. It can happen when communication contains hidden unintended messages or when it inadvertently makes an undesired behavior seem normal. For example, messages from a utility about reducing energy use caused low-energy users to consume more energy when their consumption was compared with others, and anti-littering posters emphasizing the extent of the problem increased littering.\n\nAnother intuitive communication strategy that backfires is presenting information in a myth-versus-fact format. You\u2019ve probably seen this format used in communications aimed at debunking myths about health, science, technology, culture and more. Yet, research demonstrates that the \u201cstate-and-negate\u201d format makes it more likely people will remember myths as facts. A facts-only approach improves retention of the correct information.\nResearch finds where instincts lead you astray\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s Free (to Wear Sunscreen),\u201d originally penned as a newspaper column by journalist Mary Schmich, doesn\u2019t tell graduates to trust their instincts, but that is commonly dispensed commencement advice.\nThe research demonstrates that when it comes to effective communication strategies, trusting your instincts can lead you astray. The same research provides insight into why you may instinctively react in certain ways to some messages.  \nSo, if I were to offer this year\u2019s graduates just one tip for the future, I would encourage them to check their communication instincts against evidence-based recommendations. I would call my speech \u201cEverybody\u2019s Free (to Beat Backfires).\u201d\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Science communication, Identity, Communication, Polarization, Cultural cognition theory, Debunking, Science of science communication, Self-concept","role":"assistant"}]}

Those calculations appeared in a document put out by the Conservatives which accused Labour of making billions of pounds worth of unfunded spending commitments. \nSince the debate on June 4, the \u00a32,000 figure has been subjected to a great deal of scrutiny. And it quickly became clear that it was full of holes. \nThe sums had not been endorsed by Treasury officials, and were based on projections which vastly increased the cost of Labour\u2019s spending plans while underestimating the potential tax revenue Labour says it plans to raise.\n\n\n\n\n\nPut simply, the Conservatives said that a Labour government would have much less money than it expects to have, and that its spending projects will cost much more than they think. \nOverall, some \u00a320 billion (around a third) of the spending totals identified by the Conservative\u2019s dossier appear to be substantially overstated. \nThe biggest spending item listed in the document is \u00a318.9 billion for Labour\u2019s \u201cgreen prosperity plan\u201d. But Labour has said that its new fiscal rules would allow it to borrow for investment, so this sum does not necessarily have to be offset against tax revenue.\nElsewhere, the document claims that Labour\u2019s plans to reduce outsourcing, for things like IT systems, will add \u00a36.5 billion to costs. But it gets to this figure by assuming that \u201cinsourcing\u201d services is always 7.5% more expensive that using outside contractors. A recent report by the Institute of Government concluded that there is no definitive evidence that this is the case. \nSeparately, in costing Labour\u2019s offer of free breakfast clubs in primary schools, the assumption is made that 50% of all children will take this up. It also claims that Labour will fully fund the cost of additional meals and staffing, bringing the total cost to \u00a34.5 billion, which Labour denies.\nThen there is the price of Labour\u2019s plan to reform local bus services, which the Conservatives estimate to be \u00a33.6 billion. But the small print explaining this figure reads: \u201cThis costing has been done at pace with limited data and therefore the uncertainty and risk of error is high.\u201d \nThere are some unsurprisingly pessimistic assumptions in the revenue raising figures too. For example, the Conservatives say that raising VAT on private schools will raise substantially less than Labour\u2019s estimate of up to \u00a31.7 billion per year. They also suggest that Labour\u2019s plan for taxing non-doms will raise very little (\u00a3100 million per year) after the first year. \nThen finally, by choosing to add up these purported costs over four years rather than annually, the writers of the Conservatives\u2019 dossier came up with a figure of \u00a358.9 billion in new spending plans. They then subtracted projected revenues of \u00a320.4 billion over the same period to produce a \u201cblack hole\u201d total of \u00a338.5 billion. \nThis big number was divided by the number of working adults (18 million) in the UK to reach the bill of \u00a32,000 per family. (Some viewers might have assumed this was a yearly total rather than a cost over four years.)\n\nBut looking at it on a yearly basis, the supposed gap between extra revenue and extra spending is about \u00a310 billion, which in fact is less than the amount of \u201cheadroom\u201d that the next government is projected to have to meet its fiscal target.\nAnd of course, if Rachel Reeves becomes chancellor, she will have the chance to set a budget for the next few years, and decide how much revenue to raise. She would also be carrying out a much delayed spending review that will set the targets for governmental spending over the next three years. \nSo there will be plenty of scope for trade-offs, both in spending and taxation.  \nA better system\nMeanwhile, as Sunak\u2019s \u00a32,000 figure is investigated by the Office for Statistics Regulation, it\u2019s worth remembering that this government is not the only one to try and predict the cost of the opposition\u2019s policies before a general election. As far back as the 2005 general election, Gordon Brown claimed that there was a \u00a335 billion black hole in Conservative spending plans. \nAnd Labour has now accused the Tories of having a \u00a371 billion black hole of their own, based on the assumption that they will immediately implement the chancellor\u2019s wish to eventually eliminate national insurance (and possibly inheritance tax).\nBut surely there is a better way to inform the public in way that does not give the party in power a huge advance in crunching the numbers. Lord Gus O'Donnell, the former head of the Treasury as well as the civil service, called opposition costings \u201cone of the grubbiest processes I\u2019ve ever been involved in\u201d.\nHe explained: \u201cMinisters tell you to produce these costings on some assumptions they give you, which are dodgy assumptions designed to make the policy look as bad as possible.\u201d\nIn the Netherlands, opposition parties can ask a government agency, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, for an official costing of their own proposals.\nIn the UK, it has been suggested that this could become part of the role of the OBR (although it would require greater resources and more access to government data). If it was, it might just reduce the fog that often clouds debates over spending \u2013 and potentially expose issues in the political plans of all parties that they don\u2019t want to talk about.\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Conservative Party, Labour Party, Keir Starmer, Rishi Sunak, UK 2024 general election, UK TV debates","role":"assistant"}]}

This is a long-established Labour policy, one that Keir Starmer has reaffirmed his commitment to during the election campaign.

Ever since this idea was first floated, around the beginning of the century, I have argued against it. At one point, I even set up a website, now defunct, called Votes for Adults, to put the counter-case. \nI served on a thing called the Youth Citizenship Commission set up by Gordon Brown to examine the subject \u2013 along with some upstart president of the NUS called Wes Streeting; whatever happened to him? The policy produced the shortest media quote I\u2019ve given in my career, when the Sun quoted me as saying: \u201cIt\u2019s a daft idea.\u201d\nI am not a fan.\nYet this isn\u2019t a blow. It\u2019s not even a surprise. It won\u2019t hurt Labour at the election. It may even be, broadly, positive.\nIt comes as no surprise to discover that there was majority opposition to the policy, because most surveys have shown this for decades. Votes at 16 has long been a niche interest. \nIndeed, several years ago, the Hansard Society, a charity that studies democracy, carried out a survey asking respondents which aspects of the constitution they understood and which they approved of. The only one to have both majority understanding and approval was having the voting age at 18 \u2013 and it seemed to me curious that we would change the only bit of the constitution that people understood and liked.\nGiven this, will it hurt Labour? Almost certainly not. There is a broader issue here about how people vote. Half a century ago the great political science pairing of David Butler and Donald Stokes noted that for an issue to matter, four conditions needed to be met. First, the voter needed to be aware of an issue. \nSecond, they needed to have an attitude or opinion on it. Third, the parties needed to have differing stances on the issue. And fourth, the voter then needed to vote for the party with the stance that was closest to theirs. These are quite high bars, and many issues fail to clear them.\nVotes at 16 does meet some of these criteria but it seems unlikely that it will matter enough to actually drive people\u2019s votes, at least to the extent of making people vote one way or another. Even I won\u2019t be letting it determine my choice of vote \u2013 and it\u2019s difficult to think of who might.\nFor some people, issues like this do provide a convenient excuse or justification (\u201cI was thinking about voting Labour, but then I heard they wanted votes at 16\u201d, says someone who has voted Conservative for all his life\u2026).\n\nAnd the issue can matter in other ways. First, and most obviously, because once it\u2019s implemented, the new voters it enfranchises are more likely not to be Conservative-supporting (at least in the short term).\nLabour politicians will deny that this is why they are doing it \u2013 \u201cI am shocked, shocked, to discover short-term partisan reasoning driving constitutional reform!\u201d \u2013 and you might well think that things like this would be better done on a cross-party basis. \nBut if the subject comes up, it allows them to respond by pivoting to areas on which the Conservatives have acted in a way that lacked cross-party agreement (\u201cI will take no lectures about partisanship from the people who introduced a system of voter ID designed to lower turnout and keep young people away from the polls\u201d).\nAnd second, whatever its merits, it does have the vague whiff of being a policy, maybe even a moderately radical one, and one on which the Conservatives oppose. It also doesn\u2019t cost much.

However in a new book, Living Hot, Clive Hamilton and George Wilkenfeld challenge current priorities, arguing rising temperatures can\u2019t be contained fast enough and we need to turn our attention to \u201cadaptation\u201d.\nClive Hamilton, who is Professor of Public Ethics at Charles Sturt University, joined us to talk about what Australia can do to not only survive but thrive under these conditions. \nHamilton explains why he\u2019s pessimistic about how much we can limit the warming of our planet:\n\nSimply studying the science makes anyone pessimistic about the possibility of preventing a large amount of global warming and the consequent effects.

So I\u2019m just following the science on that.\n\nOn what needs to change, Hamilton maintains we focus too much on mitigation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe debate in Australia is completely preoccupied with mitigation. George, my co-author, and I were very much part of this until a year ago. [\u2026] The reality is [mitigation is] not going to make much difference, but what will make a difference is if [we] decide to embark on, plan for, fund and carry out a massive multi-decade transformation of Australia \u2013 our infrastructure, our farming and housing, building regulations our coastal management and our nature management. \n\nFood security will be one of our biggest challenges, Hamilton says:\n\nThere are two elements to this. One is we think globally, we export a lot of food products and we import them too but they\u2019re mostly processed stuff we could do without at the pinch. But I think globally, if there\u2019s widespread failures of food systems there\u2019s going to be an ever greater demand for products from Australia. Which will drive the prices up. \nThe second thing is that the impact of climate change on farming systems and water availability is already starting to bite and all of that analysis suggests it\u2019s going to get worse and possibly a lot worse. The amount of arable land is declining, and agricultural productivity is falling. For example, cows give less milk when it\u2019s hot, and of course, if there\u2019s less rain, there\u2019s less grass to raise and so they\u2019re less productive. \n\nHamilton outlines why engineering projects won\u2019t cut it in dealing with the effects of climate change and why relocations are key: \n\nThere are all kinds of grand engineering schemes which are either going to be prohibitively expensive or won\u2019t work. Some of them are pretty wacko. So nature will defeat most engineering plans, and it\u2019s best to get out of the way. It\u2019s a lesson indigenous people learned long ago incidentally, and so I think that when you see relocations happen, it always needs a collaboration of three levels of government because local councils themselves, even though they might have the will, frequently don\u2019t have the money, or the powers to carry out those kinds of town-saving projects.\n\n","role":"user"},{"content":"Climate change, Global warming, Politics with Michelle Grattan, climate mitigation, Net zero emissions","role":"assistant"}]}
